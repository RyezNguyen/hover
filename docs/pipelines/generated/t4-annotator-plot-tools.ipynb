The neo-nazi movement has a right to make speeches, say anything they want.  They do not have a right to have these speeches published by the N.Y. Times.  That depends on the Times analysis of the economic and to somewhat extent newsworthy value of those speeches.  Likewise to the sysadmin of this fellows system.

I'm new to this group, and maybe this has been covered already, but does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the environment being turned (unintentionally, of course) into pantheism?  I've debated this quite a bit, and while I think a legitimate concern for the planet is a great thing, I can easily see it being perverted into something dangerous.  As evidence, may I quote THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (of all things!), April 2 (Editorial page): \\\"We suspect that's because one party to the (environmental) dispute thinks the Earth is sanctified.

TIA,   John\",\" Is the license required for driving a car exclusively on private property, such as a farm? Here in the United States, the license is required only for the use of public roads.   We also have a nation of 250 million people, _many_ issues and usually only two candidates for a given office. A President might be willing to abuse mild gun control laws and create a de-facto ban (something a majority of the people would object to) and still be elected: The voters might look at issues like the civil rights of minorities, health care, etc... and vote for the \\\"lesser of two evils.\\\" I don't think this is a matter of paranoia, since local governments in (for example) New York and Chicago have abused existing, mild gun control laws to  create a virtual ban.   In which case, the United States already has adaquate gun control laws: According to federal statistic, only 7% of gun-wielding criminals legally purchase their own guns from licensed dealers. If that's the point of gun control (to prevent criminals from legally purchasing guns) then America doesn't need any additional laws to accomplish this.   How is this any different from guns? There are legal purposes for owning and using a gun: They are appropriate tools for hunting, target shooting and self-defence. Like cars, murder isn't their only (or even a common) use.   I certainly couldn't imagine the American public accepting regulation of axes. While the politics of other nations may be different, in America there is strong opposition to any intrusive law that primarily would effect the average, law-abiding citizen who had not done anything wrong.   A good way to deal with which problem? It is an excelent way to deal  with the short-term problem of rioting and violent attacks. Of course, it doesn't do anything for the long-term issues that start riots. But at this point, what can these individuals do about long-term social problems?    There are, according to surveys, guns in 40% of American homes. In many parts of the country, this is closer to 100%. Those places where almost everyone owns a gun are, on average, safer than those where guns are less common.   This is, I think, a fundamental difference between American government and that of other nations. Here it is not acceptable to punish or restrict the average, law-abiding citizen in the name of some vague \\\"common good.\\\" \",\" the fancy piggyback shocks on the 550 (and the 750, i think.  i don't know about the zr1100) are very nice, 3-way adjustability.  the forks are crappy, they dive like MAD.  i had progressive springs installed and it made a huge difference.  cheap fix, MUCH improvement.\",\"Hello, and thank you for reading this request.

Note that the very issue of the Batman comic book (\\\"Seduction of the Gun\\\") that was produced as a tool for gun-control organizations carries a back- page ad for a \\\"Terminator II\\\" video game extolling the numerous and varied sophisticated weapons available to the player.

Just a strut going down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an A-arm), with a tension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction?   Anyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using shorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shortening the strut below the perch.  In each of these cases, the suspension geometry will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the intended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom of the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore the suspension geometry.  IMHO, the kit that includes the spacer is the only way to go...  --Ken\",\"Jeff,   I have answers to both of your questions.  First, I recommend the Sony CPD-1320 monitor.  It is a 14\\\" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed specifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video capabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci.  All it takes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is about $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of comparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for half a year and I love it.   Second, I have used Syex and found them to be decent.  I had a backorder on a Supra modem which I cancelled.  They were helpful in explaining the reasons why there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me.  The only complaint was that they did not always return my calls.

In fact, for the Bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use.  The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.  It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo- Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man.  This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers have done).  Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I think the important aspect is the result.  David.  --- On religion:\",\" Gulp.

Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.  Monday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.  Synopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that Randy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National Firearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.  The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently ended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither by KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.  The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley, who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person named Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms in his dealings with Randy Weaver.  Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an Aryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two then met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in time) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons transaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, \\\"He felt like he (Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the White cause.\\\"  The two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and later went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second meeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to tape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12- gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of 19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge shotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of 24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel length and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver is reported to have said that he could perform better work once his machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility of future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars for the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty dollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have simply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 - over a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).  The next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that his \\\"source\\\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead of the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver suspected he was dealing with an informant, \\\"I had a guy in Spokane tell me you were bad.\\\"  Fadeley managed to convince Weaver otherwise.  The _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were made of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these meetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also reported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki Weaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must have also been phone taps.  These tapes were played to the court via both headphones and loudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's attorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to make sure that the government proved its case, \\\"...if it has a case at all...\\\" according to the rules.  Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his wife's voice on the tape.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect this trial is not explained.  Other notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning Kevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are surprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were surprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained in the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy Weaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that Harris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report that the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming at Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics are charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the only non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and Deputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that Harris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.\",\": >And, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been traded,  : >resigned, or been striped of his title during the season?

Jewish history as recorded in the Old Testament and as shown by archaeology are the same.  Kings, revivals, Temples, and all.  The Torah, as far as I know, is the five books of Moses.  Then come the Prophets (all the Prophets, plus Joshua, Judges, 1&2 Samuel, 1&2 Kings) and the Writings (Psalms, Proverbs, Lamentations, Ruth, Esther, Ezra, Nehemiah, Ecclesiates, Song of Songs, 1&2 Chronicles, Job).

Your Moslem friend is sorely mistaken, but understandably so.  If Jesus was crucified, and atoned for our sins, he must have been God, for only the death of God could atone for the sins of all humanity.  And as Isaiah predicts, the messiah will be called \\\"the mighty God.\\\"  And if he was God, then he must have rose, for as St. Paul wrote, it was not possible that death could hold him.

The people of  Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never  abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally  hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole  perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July  15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop  Makarios.  Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with  the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right  given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently  and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For  those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island  since 1571.   The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct.               THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM  2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus  It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum.  AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS  The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed...  The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.  Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event.  \\\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying, in  Greek, \\\"You want Taksim eh!\\\"  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.  When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered.  In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying \\\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\\\"  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed.  An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded.  We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.  There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter.  After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport.  All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me.\\\"  ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER  We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days.  We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights.  In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner.  In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother.  In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head.  This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.  Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.  In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16  wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.

My suggestion is aimed at reducing the level of tension and casualties on all sides. It is unfortunate that Israel does not agree with my opinion.     That is too bad.    Because Israel is not occupying the \\\"Security Zone\\\" free of charge. It is paying the price for that.  Once Israel withdraws it may have lost a bargaining chip at the negociating table but it would save some soldiers' lives, that is my contention.    If Lebanon were willing to agree to  That is completely untrue.  Hizbollah is now a minor force in Lebanese politics.  The real heavy weights are Syria's allies.  The gov't is  supported by Syria.  The Lebanese Army is over 30,000 troops and unified like never before.  Hizbollah can have no moral justification in attacking Israel proper, especially after Israeli withdrawal. That would draw the ire of the Lebanese the Syrian and the Israeli gov'ts.  If Israel does withdraw and such an act  (Hizbolllah attacking Israel) would be akin to political and moral  suicide.

Yes, the argument can (and has) been made that current government policy creates even larger market barriers than there were in the first place, but there is no such term as 'government failure', since the government can change policies whenever it pleases.  The market doesn't do that and is governed by (relatively) well-understood forces.

A while back, there was a thread in this group about the use of the IWII in Europe (in countries with 50 Hz AC current).  The consensus at the time was that the IWII would not work there.  As I will be moving there this summer, I called Apple to make sure and they told me (today) that the IWII (as bought in the U.S.) will definitely run on 50 Hz AC current (as long as a step-down converter is employed if 240 V current is used).  The same info, turns out, can be found in the IWII manual (p. 127 in the 1989 version), but I didn't really trust that.  Does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary?

The answers I received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However, during this process I have come up with new problems.  1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic string. Is this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS or VB?  2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the DDE SQL command, (provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names) but how is one meant to update a database?    a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.    b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command from VB cannot       be used because when the macro requests information from VB using a       second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time- outs occur.       (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access to VB channel       is initiated, I guess.)    c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.      The way I eventually managed to update a database was by sending key-    strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This technique has    the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a    state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB sends.  Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect assumptions? Are there any better work arounds to the above? Are there any signs of an ODBC driver for Access?\",\" Don't be so sure.  Look what happened to Japanese citizens in the US during World War II.  If you're prepared to say \\\"Let's round these people up and stick them in a concentration camp without trial\\\", it's only a short step to gassing them without trial.  After all, it seems that the Nazis originally only intended to imprison the Jews; the Final Solution was dreamt up partly because they couldn't afford to run the camps because of the devastation caused by Goering's Total War.  Those who weren't gassed generally died of malnutrition or disease. \",\" I think the problem here is that I pretty much ignored the part about the Jews sightseeing for 2000 years, thinking instead that the important part of what the original poster said was the bit about killing Palestinians.  In retrospect, I can see how the sightseeing thing would be offensive to many.  I originally saw it just as poetic license, but it's understandable that others might see it differently.

When graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft, presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft doesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes 'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope'.   Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans, such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed taxi tests).

I would rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.  2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an impressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's reputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the AL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he pitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.  3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently. BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters. Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year.  4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that Walk desrved his contract.  5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I can't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through waivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught. Not a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught should have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed pitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to trade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere wasn't very fit last year.  6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!! 7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the season. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks, Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have pitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money on Patterson in stead.  8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.  9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke. 10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his value has increased immensely.  11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount. Let's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better. Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better than a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.  12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay. 13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace two of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a very respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have a respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options for the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was getting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.  14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave. they will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed. Now, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots, nothing else will.  On a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2 starts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the season, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked in the second half of the last 2 seasons)> \",\"Dunno about Miller.

Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That means third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consulting a 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at  21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks. Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are wrong.  By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as California, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally  stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law,  but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors, willing to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was terribly upset about this.

Yep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the #1 spot.  It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.

Singer brings up the Strawberry Incident, where he lost a homerun and the fan caught it.   Yes, I think he should have done more to get out of the way.  As much as fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning the game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware that this is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch it himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.  I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against  visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the field.  Now, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or not.

Generally, these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, for example, we have the following set regarding children:   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to   the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum   [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem   families and received as servants when they are left alone through   the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect   all such children in your province and send them to the places of   deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to   the people.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [1]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the   time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their   lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.      Minister of the Interior,       Talaat\\\" [2]   \\\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.    November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the   orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their   places of exile.        Abdullahad Nuri. [3]    \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been   opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is   done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt   of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or   any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it   purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as   detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received   into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish   special orphanages for them.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat.\\\" [4]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.     Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures   to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with   the caravans.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [5]   \\\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.    At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows   of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is   not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by   Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble   in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned   out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of   deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent   away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [6]  In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \\\"rationalizing\\\" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:   \\\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for   its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks   it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I   shall die for it.\\\" [7]   These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these \\\"death march orders\\\" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.  For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.  If one were to examine the sample \\\"authentic text\\\" provided in the Turkish  Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it  too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the  Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or  Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery.   Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide  architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a  heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.  This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian.     - - - references - - -  [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60  [2] ibid, page 60  [3] ibid, page 60  [4] ibid, page 61  [5] ibid, page 61  [6] ibid, page 62  [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and     London), 1926, page 387  \",\"  I don't believe IRQ5 is the problem.

Afterwards, we sat down to discuss prices.  I explained that I wanted a car just like the one I drove, but in a different color.  He said he could get one exactly like I wanted from the dealer network within a day.  We then negotiated a price and signed the deal.  Next day, I get a call.  He explains that they goofed, and they had neglected to take into account a price increase. (The last price increase had occurred over 4 months prior to my visit.)  If I still wanted the car, I would have to fork over another $700.  As an alternative, they would honor the price if I bought the car I test drove (which had been sitting around for  6 months and had a few miles on it). I said goodbye.

The  satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section  housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof  mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The  proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation  pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered  around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.       TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The  2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a  single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be  powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).

It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal civlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967 without civil and political rights.   It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza is not a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreign country for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians are concerned and as far as common sense has it.   It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens and the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.  Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel is entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be entitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel to enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.  To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a crime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss  to which Israeli society has degraded.   I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return and live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ? Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their religion or ethnic origin ?

I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted Flakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.  Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think \\\"Oh, oh, this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.\\\"  Ten  minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.  When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even he is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when a person has a seizure.  Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you can guess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there has.  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get across what is going on here.

Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci.  Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women  poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did  not exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I  see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.    Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have  no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that  balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians  who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go  from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and  then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling  quack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a  quack.    I've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten  years now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were  raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their  farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to  entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is  about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition  either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I  know that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at  least a few \\\"enlightened\\\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really  too bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if  they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the  medical profession.  In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \\\"good\\\" bacteria after  antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not  have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \\\"good\\\" bacteria is  needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all  kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small  and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are  nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune  system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike  the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce  toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of  these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up  residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this  happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals  and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what  vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling  Elaine's doctor a quack.  Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly  called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a  yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis. Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it  requires that the host immune system be severly depressed.    Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of  normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral  course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain  much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in  it's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely  survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides  the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In  diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little  buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but  some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus  membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to  the candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on  the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \\\"treat\\\" it. If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty  nondiscript.     Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in  the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the  vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system  ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless  they broach the mucus membrane \\\"barrier\\\".  If they do, an inflammatory  response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A  from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than  they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin  A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane  barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong  inflammatory response after a candida bloom.    While diabetics can suffer from a candida \\\"bloom\\\" the  most common cause of  this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which  knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main  competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are  available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not  use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of  the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus  inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum  antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate  just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring  vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.  But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by  the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to  return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of  the problem is addressed(lack of a \\\"good\\\" bacterial flora in the body and/or  poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective  therapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving  organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not  grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is  the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum  antibiotics).    In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good  reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very  favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and  humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to  minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.    If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even  blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the  bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology  occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool  for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first  place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong  but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan  has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool  specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of  false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant  basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have  colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a  doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.  Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria  tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline  during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina.  Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal  problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of  Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of  the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina  problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year  until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting  scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had  the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some  digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she  used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex  returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic  GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his  patients is a non-existent syndrome.  The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria  which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.   If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through  aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system  needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and  some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans  are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of  the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent  disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).   Some of the above material was obtained from \\\"Natural Healing\\\" by Mark  Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human  nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in  the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely  important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in  the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida  blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate  intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI  system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out  grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and  fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check  once carbohydrate is returned to the gut.  If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post,  fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably  accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin  A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice  from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our  time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved  your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly  seeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior.    Martin Banschbach, Ph.D. Professor of Biochemistry and Chairman Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine 1111 West 17th St. Tulsa, Ok. 74107\",\"I'm attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether the proposed wiretap (or \\\"Clipper\\\") chip is a cost-effective tool for police investigation.  That is, ignoring concerns about government intrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry, and their customers, to support this wiretap technology?    A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million dollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S. wiretaps led to 2057 arrests, while total police expenditures of $28 billion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].) I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately, but I'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology.  Please send me quotable/citeable estimates for:  - How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all   phones with wiretap chips? - How much would it cost to make each chip? - How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place? - How much more would supporting hardware, people, etc. cost, per chip? - What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been   if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs? - What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed   \\\"law enforcement blocks\\\"? - What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year?  Put another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each police agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication to be wiretap compatible?  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps, or would they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes in other ways?\",\"Archive-name: rec-autos/part5  [this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast, and so is not crossposted to misc.consumers.  -- rpw]     [changes as of 14 April 1993: revised brake fluid section, as     non-silicone DOT-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw]                   Commonly Asked Automotive Questions   Tire Questions:  Q:  What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean?  A:  Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14.  the 195 is the     overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually     narrower.  The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the     sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire     has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel     diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'     tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like     390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed     rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly     inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common     speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to     150MPH.)      Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed     rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find     designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load     associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous     operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is     a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum     per-tire loads:      Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157     Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125      Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.      In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire     size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation     indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application     of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters     only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of     interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For     the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference     between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at     all.      If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.      Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating     reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)      There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,     traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded     A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is     a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they     are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are     thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.  Q:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put     normal tires on the car?  A:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.     Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible     with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them     so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that     more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)     You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your     car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly     dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,     or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard     to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear     has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.  Q:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side     of my car?  A:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many     say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a     car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others     (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping     is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before     rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.  Q:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the     car should I put them on?  A:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't     get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow     conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there     are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear     wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car     going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car     (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,     stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the     snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes     while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.  Radar Detectors and Speed Limits:  Q:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits     in this Q&A posting?  A:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between     misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless     flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please     subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.  Safety Equipment:  Q:  Do airbags really work?  A:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much     better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than     Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than     3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend     to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the     explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but     not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention     of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.  Brake Questions:  Q:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas     always wants to do this.  A:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing     rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors     more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped     warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or     to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas     are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical     to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,     or badly grooved.  Q:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is     this really a good idea?  A:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade     prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of     downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases     of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more     than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they     are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.      On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA     still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I     suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to     do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a     car with an automatic to take the test.  Q:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?  A:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to     absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake     system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type     are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The     principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry     boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling     point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest     wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better     boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling     point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see     the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that     DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific     cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly     competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_     improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for     DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out     fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid     out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.  Q:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?  A:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks     excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone     based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and     DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound     like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in     such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any     metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend     to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where     most of the corrosion occurs.      Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to     Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly     beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the     brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.      Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are     difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which     interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they     generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they     do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable     in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense     in some street car applications, but they are certainly not     recommended for high performance driving applications, and the     economics are questionable for street use.      I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard     that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably     compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little     information at this time.  Q:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs     more.  Is it worth it?  A:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will     be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer     is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally     work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does     not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),     and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques     like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.      Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the     car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able     be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several     systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is     what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence     of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed     sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and     may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original     equipment or OE-equivalent components.      When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking     the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the     system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS     will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a     sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could     sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is     achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as     the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are     truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system     this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this     duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;     on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform     threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on     snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes     locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,     has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this     eventuality.      A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves     steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are     braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release     the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off     on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.     Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.      An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical     braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on     glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.     The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an     ABS system in your car.      As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential     restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the     following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder     for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master     cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for     over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5     (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of     the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system     components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid     becomes very important.  Q:  What about this threshold braking business?  A:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent     publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers     in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is     needed here -- rpw]      Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high     performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab     the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much     to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate     maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but     just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold     brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn     to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake     pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the     threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.     In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're     not very near the threshold.      In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just     before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on     the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very     close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better     stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS     take over.      Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of     accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with     ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed     the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now     seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the     involved officers had any recent performance driving training.     There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing     brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique     of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to     try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you     think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must     cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least     1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that     much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.     Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective     and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if     you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at     the pedal will be sufficient.      Gas Questions:  Q:  Does High Octane gasoline help?  A:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the     engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.     On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your     car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car     needs.  Q:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?  A:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,     although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase     in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded     gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,     check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not     actually require leaded gasoline.  Q:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?  A:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use     dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.     Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl     Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs     and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.      Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes     called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's     manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider     10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol     (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected     cars.      An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with     fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that     do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain     Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything     in your gas tank.      There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are     noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work     much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,     Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,     once every six months, is highly recommended.  Q:  What about detergent gasolines?  A:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW     has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this     test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test     are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such     gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.     Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean     engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.  Lubrication Questions:  Q:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?  A:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter     code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer      uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are     for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine     applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels     of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,     SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.      The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either     a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by     the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly     used these days, and are the only type that most automobile     manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the     designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;     the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity     of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually     get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What     is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity     of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast     as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the     viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.      Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not     all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all     30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the     novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has     been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils     do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,     15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.  Q:  Are `quick lube' places any good?  A:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out     there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure     that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on     your wallet at all times.  Q:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?  A:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have     come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based     additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the     chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,     auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET     responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight     increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term     results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are     debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the     product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes     deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners     have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of     Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50     Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as     it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are     no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.      On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.  Q:  Do synthetic oils really work?  A:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,     but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by     oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to     change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your     car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change     the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty     as conventional oils.      Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter     entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very     effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.  Q:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.     How often should I change my oil?  A:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)     gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs     down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,     you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you     only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up     to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,     perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are     now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car     much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change     oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,     then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out     of storage.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they     break.  What's the story?  A:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,     for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but     the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.     Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.      If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the     belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent     replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if     there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time     (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have     a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,     destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage     as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water     pump can be a costly mistake.)  Q:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it     self destructs when the timing belt breaks?  A:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the     valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression     ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are     more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance     oriented vehicles.  Q:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?  A:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety     Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be     caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the     same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report     goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator     is probably the cause.\",\" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      Just a random passing thought, but can anyone cite a documented use of encryption technology by criminals and terrorists.

Also: come on, Brad. If we are going to get anywhere in  this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never  addressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is  \\\"right\\\" or who is \\\"wrong\\\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover  and that, having been placed \\\"in between\\\" the Israelis and the guerillas, they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.    [The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms   is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that   civilians will not be thought of by the other side as  \\\"combatants\\\". So, what do you think is the \\\"meaning behind\\\",   the intention and the effect when an \\\"army\\\" purposely   *does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look   like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will   receive from this \\\"cover\\\" is more important that the harm  that will come to civilians.*  This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians in \\\"the middle\\\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians.   But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves  at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \\\"why set   ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made   cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of   view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept   some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.   I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND ineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait  until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that \\\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\\\" will do more to stop attacks.   As I said previously, Israel spent several decades \\\"sitting passively\\\" on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after* the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well. The \\\"host\\\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks  from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact  on the civilians caught in their path.    This is just another \\\"selectively applied\\\" statement.   The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.  That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for  the \\\"interim\\\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are demanding conditions that essentially define \\\"autonomy\\\" already. They DO NOT trust that Israel will \\\"follow through\\\" the entire process and allow Palestinians to reach full autonomy.   Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians?  If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians  be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words? Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up \\\"tangible assets  (land, control of areas) in exchange for \\\"words\\\". For this reason, they are also concerned about the sorts of \\\"guarantees\\\" they will have  that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.  Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the Israelis \\\"word\\\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being demanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party finally gets HOLD of this \\\"land\\\", what the \\\"other party\\\" does is totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land, your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to keeps its word does NOT get the land back.   While the \\\"major armaments\\\" (those allowing people to wage \\\"civil wars\\\") have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still remain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \\\"commando\\\" raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.   Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks were commonplace.   There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \\\"disarmed\\\" UNLESS the state is as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.  That's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to \\\"take over\\\" Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that. What both \\\"sides\\\" need is to receive something \\\"tangible\\\". The Arabs/ Palestinians are looking for \\\"land\\\" and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it gives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks\",\"    Rather than decide which book you want to buy, you need to decide which programming interface you want to use, then buy the appropriate book.  I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences between PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out pretty soon).  But here's a brief summary...  PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many devices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take advantage of a 3D extension to X called \\\"PEX\\\".  PEXlib is a slightly \\\"lower\\\" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX extension to X.  Some advantages of using PEXlib... - Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS - Provides immediate mode capabilities - Is free of \\\"policy\\\" - PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support   features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).   PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.  Some advantages of using PHIGS... - Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones - Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output - PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier - PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you - PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.  If you're working strictly in X and don't care about things like archiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find that both API's have a lot in common.\",\" I think VW got caught out on the airbag thing.  It's only been in the last year or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature. VW assumed that  automatic belts would satisfy govt. requirements for passive restraint, but didn't guess that the 'merican consumer would actually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag.  VW is really hurting right now in the US market.  Check out the article in last week's Autoweek about the crisis at VW.  Golfs and Jettas will be coming from the plant in Mexico, but they don't have the quality at that facility.  As per normal VW practice, the US launch of the Jetta III is delayed again and again, until a good chunk of the useful life of the design is spent.  I think that Passats come from Germany, so there is not the same quality and availability issue.  It's a nice car with a nice engine. Whether VW will be a player in the US market in two year's time is a different question...\",\"In-Reply-To: <20APR199312262902@rigel.tamu.edu> lmp8913@rigel.tamu.edu (PRESTON, LISA M)\",\"    Good comeback, Rog.

If the system is really secure, then why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?  There are plenty of encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure, so why in the world use one that does?  There are reasons, of course, but I certainly can't think of any honest ones.  Next, you assume we can \\\"trust\\\" the escrow houses. But the last time I checked, EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure, corruption, and even fabrication, of supposedly secure data. The govt is saying \\\"Yeah, but NOW we're serious, so you can trust us.\\\"  Bullcrypt.   And finally, although you didn't state it explicitly, you implicitly assume that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. The case in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this score.  Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers, right?  As others have pointed out, the current proposal will, if deployed, render truly secure encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sam's brand. Who will be able to afford, and be sufficiently motivated, to purchase this expensive, inconvenient higher protection?  Somebody with lots of extra cash...

Points covered here are ones which are not covered in the \\\"Introduction to Atheism\\\"; you are advised to read that article as well before posting.  These answers are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive. The purpose of the periodic FAQ postings is not to stifle debate, but to raise its level. If you have something to say concerning one of these questions and which isn't covered by the answer given, please feel free to make your point.  Overview of contents:     \\\"What is the purpose of this newsgroup?\\\"    \\\"Hitler was an atheist!\\\"    \\\"The Bible proves it\\\"    \\\"Pascal's Wager\\\"    \\\"What is Occam's Razor?\\\"    \\\"Why it's good to believe in Jesus\\\"    \\\"Why I know that God exists\\\"    \\\"Einstein and \\\"God does not play dice\\\"\\\"    \\\"Everyone worships something\\\"    \\\"Why there must be a causeless cause\\\"    \\\"The universe is so complex it must have been designed\\\"    \\\"Independent evidence that the Bible is true\\\"    \\\"Godel's Incompleteness Theorem\\\"    \\\"George Bush on atheism and patriotism\\\"    \\\"I know where hell is!\\\"    \\\"Biblical contradictions wanted\\\"    \\\"The USA is a Christian nation\\\"    \\\"The USA is not a Christian nation\\\"  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Subject: What is the purpose of this newsgroup?  Typical posting:  Why have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups?   What is there to discuss?  Response:  Many things are discussed here, including:  * Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's   family * Prayer in schools * Discrimination against atheists * Sunday trading laws * The Satanic Child Abuse myth * Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet' * How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students * How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers * Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual * Why people become atheists  Of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians looking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't  want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure  from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.  ------------------------------  Subject: Hitler was an atheist!  Typical posting:  Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!  Response:  Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:     The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in    his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_    superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_    not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]     For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their    abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the    Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be    active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every    man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who    in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his    religious community and tries to butt into the other.     [...]     Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will    of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_    fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]            -- Adolf Hitler, from \\\"Mein Kampf\\\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.  Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed  to believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist,  though.  ------------------------------  Subject: The Bible proves it  Typical posting:  In the Bible it says that...  Response:  Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed 'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The Bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted.  Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to \\\"interpretation\\\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and one thing only is not legitimate.  Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.  It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: Pascal's Wager  Typical posting:  If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing -- but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.  Response:  This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.  Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often described as the \\\"avoiding the wrong hell\\\" problem.  If a person is a follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.  Secondly, the statement that \\\"If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing\\\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness. Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer.  Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that  the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of  comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God  is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.  Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on  evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or  cost-benefit analysis.  Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:    1. One does not know whether God exists.   2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does      exist.   3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.   4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.  There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at no \\\"cost\\\".  The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The argument thus collapses to \\\"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests to believe in God\\\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal intended the argument to be viewed.  The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him.  ------------------------------  Subject: What is Occam's Razor?  Typical posting:  People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?  Response:  William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's  Razor.  In its original form, it said \\\"Do not multiply entities  unnecessarily.\\\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity, then do so.  Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it  more generally, for example as \\\"Take the simplest solution\\\".  The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations  for what we see around us:  1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which came into being as a result of natural processes.  2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and  there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be  of non-zero complexity.  Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest  that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one. Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:  3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.   We just imagine that there is.  This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people  find unacceptable.   ------------------------------  Subject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus  Typical posting:  I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.  Response:  Preaching is not appreciated.  Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that are on a \\\"conversion\\\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup talk.religion.misc).  You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would have them do unto you!  Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy analogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it, since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why I know that God exists  Typical posting:  I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.  Response:  Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist.  That evidence varies from person to person.  Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been abducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.  ------------------------------  Subject: Einstein and \\\"God does not play dice\\\"  Typical posting:  Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?  Response:  Einstein did once comment that \\\"God does not play dice [with the universe]\\\".  This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the Christian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore, Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.  A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following: \\\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.\\\"  Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that QM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found, and much evidence suggests that it never will be.  A longer quote from Einstein appears in \\\"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A Symposium\\\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In    \\\"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events    the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side    of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him    neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an    independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a    personal God interfering with natural events could never be    *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this    doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific    knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.     But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives    of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine    which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,    will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm    to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers    of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal    God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past    placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they    will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable    of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity    itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably    more worthy task...\\\"     \\\"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,    a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a    personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.    If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the    unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our    science can reveal it.\\\"  The latter quote is from \\\"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\\\", edited by Helen  Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.   Also from the same book:    \\\"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics    to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind     it.\\\"  Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does  not in itself imply that Christianity is false.  ------------------------------  Subject: Everyone worships something  Typical posting:  Everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.  Response:  If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why there must be a causeless cause  Typical posting:  Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.  Response:  The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has no smallest member.  Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed  Typical posting:  The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you don't think all this appeared here just by chance?  Response:  This is known as the Argument From Design.  It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while.  There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here. However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence, observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth.  The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some  external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately.  But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position.  This leads us to the familiar theme of \\\"If a creator created the universe, what created the creator?\\\", but with the addition of spiralling  improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just \\\"is\\\" (or \\\"was\\\").  From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just \\\"is\\\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book \\\"A Brief History of Time\\\", explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.  The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called  Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it evolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the  watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the  universe too must have a creator.  The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above  those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates  watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have  created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are  clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.  Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in  the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear  reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument  would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a  different part of creation.  Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that  the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore  stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the  argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not  random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus  internally inconsistent.  ------------------------------  Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true  Typical posting:  The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence.  For example...  Response:  The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence.  Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or James; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but that this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \\\"reconstructions\\\" of the original text have been published to this effect.  Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320 C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material.  Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is more well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.  ------------------------------  Subject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem  Typical posting:  Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the Bible to be both true and complete.  Response:  Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal  system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary  arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be  valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal  system.)  Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \\\"Liar  Paradox.\\\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \\\"This  sentence is false.\\\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal  system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.  The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.  One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom.  This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.  It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists within the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.  Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.  Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be both consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal systems, so such claims are nonsense.  ------------------------------  Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism  Typical posting:  Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?  Response:  The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I. Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the presidential primary:   RS: \\\"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in       God is important to me.\\\"   RS: \\\"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of       Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,       nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under       God.\\\"   RS: \\\"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation       of state and church?\\\"   GB: \\\"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not       very high on atheists.\\\"  UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks.  The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27, 1989.  It can also be found in \\\"Free Enquiry\\\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue, Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.  On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane, cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School District 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \\\"one nation under God\\\" (Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:    RS: \\\"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.       Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\\\"    EM: \\\"It's bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"What is bullshit?\\\"    EM: \\\"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush       campaign is on this issue.\\\"   EM: \\\"You're welcome.\\\"  After Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract his statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the President, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by    \\\"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports    atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or    supported by the government.\\\"  For further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American Atheist Press's Cameron Road address.  ------------------------------  Subject: I know where hell is!  Typical posting:  I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!  Response:  There are several towns called \\\"Hell\\\" in various countries around the world, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now  getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.  ------------------------------  Subject: Biblical contradictions wanted  Typical posting:  Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?  Response:   American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical contradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for details.  There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the archive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the United States be considered a Christian nation?  Response:  Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some quotes; there are many more.    \\\"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?    In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the    ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen    upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been    the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert    the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient    auxiliaries.

Response:  No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):     Article 11     As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense    founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of    enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as    the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility    against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no    pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption    of the harmony existing between the two countries.  The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections such as Charles Bevans' \\\"Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776-1949\\\", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).  The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on June 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.  The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul General at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of Christianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there is no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.  In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation. \",\"I've seen PGP 2.2 mentioned for the Mac platform. I use 2.0 on MS/DOS. Is there a 2.2 for MS/DOS?

Completely smooth.  Not that it runs poorly normally, but on these days, it is exceptional.  My theory is that the air density and moisture content of the air are such that I get complete combustion.  Needless to say, it puts me in a great mood.  The mood lasted for about 20 miles.  Heading north on the 405 freeway, about a mile or two south of the 10, my throttle stopped responding.... and I was between lanes.  Nothing to do but make  my way over 4 lanes to the shoulder... initially by gliding, then by pushing.  At least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did not mind stopping for me.  Turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS40  carb.  I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws tight on a bike, but I never thought that I had to do that on the screws inside of a carb.  At least it was roadside fixable and I was on my way in hardly any time. ____________________________________________________________________________    Death is life's way of telling you you've been fired  -- R.

Put it at a convenient number like \\\"1\\\".  You *could* cut a hole in the back of the machine to route the ID switch, but why go through the hassle?  You probably won't be needing to frequently change the ID of your internal drive.   Yeah, when I first installed the tape drive I was a little concerned too.  But it's no problem, the device is designed to fit just fine with the overhang.  It shouldn't reach back beyond the ROM/RAM/VRAM SIMMs, though.   You can special-order parts to mount the device from your local Apple dealer.  The relevant parts are:    922-0358  blank bezel faceplate   922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25\\\" device mounting bracket]  Note Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to mount a 5.25\\\" device.  The service techs I talked to said, \\\"Oh sure, we stock those.\\\"  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to hold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.  As far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already cut out for a standard 5.25\\\" device.  (Why not?  They advertise these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the 5.25\\\" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for their CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.  I'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my tape drive, which is a standard 5.25\\\" device.

Are you sure about this? I'm currently looking at a copy of last  Thursday's SF Chronicle and there is the typical one column Traders ad on page C7 in the Sports section. Not only that, but there is a part in the middle which rather prominently says \\\"WANTED: We pay cash for assault rifles and pistols.\\\". Granted, I haven't seen today's paper yet. But I'd be surprised if there wasn't a Traders ad in it. It's probably worth it to write to the Chronicle (and other papers) anyway, because all their anti-gun editorials are disgusting.

The main problems we encountered were:   1) Clients written with logic like the following:       if (DefaultDepth() != 1)   /* Assume default depth is 8bit */      These clients need an 8bit deep visual in the root window     to run correctly.   2) Other clients didn't even bother to do that much, and just     outright assumed they had a *dynamic* visual class, with a     dynamic colormap. XStoreColors doesn't work on cmaps     associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes, but     many clients don't bother to check, they just start     throwing XStoreColor calls at you.  Though both are clearly client error, this is the case with so many clients that it's easier for you to expose 8bit PseudoColor as a default root window visual, than it ever would be for all these client writers to change their clients to do the right thing. --\",\"84 Mazda Pickup Rebuilt engine at 60,000 miles.

The blast is believed to be the work of a suicide bomber. Radio reports said a car packed with butane gas exploded between two parked buses, one belonging to the IDF and the other civilian. Both busses went up in flames. The blast killed an Arab man who worked at a nearby snack bar in the Mehola settlement. An Israel Radio report stated that the other man who was killed may have been the one who set off the bomb. According to officials at the Haemek Hospital in Afula, the eight IDF soldiers injured in the blast suffered light to moderate injuries.

MONTREAL\",\"      Yes, quite a number of people it seems from discussions I've had (me included). I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and started to experience these problems.  Apple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of potential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware (modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power manager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.  None of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe (no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I have no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears to help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on startup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is being corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any non-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be reset by \\\"holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up\\\" - Apple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button I'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if someone can decipher Apple's advice for me.  Beyond this Apple suggest that \\\" you should follow the technical procedures to check the hardware of this Duo\\\". Since so many others appear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there has been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line - and quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230 purchasers who have this problem.  Any more comments from others in the same boat are welcome, particularly Apple Duo engineers :-)  cheers  brucet \",\" Sorry folks, I should have done this, and meant to just after i hit the  send key...

There is explicitly NO WARRANTY that the given settings are correct or harmless. (I only collect, I do not check for myself!!!). There is always the possibility that the settings may destroy your hardware! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Since I hope however that only well-minded people undergo the effort of posting their settings the chance of applicability exists. If you should agree or disagree with some setting, let me know immediately in order to update the list.  If you possess a HD not mentioned here of which you know BIOS and/or jumper settings, please mail them to me for the next update of the list!  Only IDE (AT-Bus) Harddisks will be accounted for. If not specified the Landing Zone should be set equal to the number of cylinders. If not specified the 'Write Precompensation' should be set 65535. (There are BIOSes that don't even ask for it).  Another statement (maybe right): IDE harddisk don't have Precomp and LZone. The precomp is a built-in parameter and lzone isn't used because most if not every IDE disk has autopark.  The jumpers' names are given as printed on the HD's board, often only a jumper number (JP12 means the jumper '12'). A zero means that the jumper is left open, a one means that the jumper is closed.    ***************************   C O N N E R   ***************************     Conner Peripherals Drive Geometry  IDE/AT  Conner drives are low level formatted at the factory.

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master.    In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives  when performing diagnostics.    There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way  interface connector. They have the following functions and are described  in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper  described nearest the 40 way interface connector.  LK2: LED       When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the      interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An      external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with      the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will      be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130      Ohms ot 220 Ohms.  LK1: Dual Drives      This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single      bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,      indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.  LK4: Master      When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If      there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be      jumpered in this way.  LK5: IOChRdy      When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is       fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher      data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per      second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally       fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per      second.     There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s) may be jumpered:       Master, single drive with LED on interface  LK2 & LK4 fitted.      Master, single drive without LED on interface LK4 only fitted.      Master, dual drive without LED on interface LK4 & LK1 fitted.      Slave, dual drive without LED on interface  No jumpers fitted.      Master, dual drive with LED on interface  LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.      Slave, dual drive with LED on interface  LK2 only fitted.     The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.     The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way  connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the  drive for this LED driver.

The magnitude of such accelerations he estimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not be a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published in 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very long-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in fact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of course. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration? Can this be extended to larger accelerations?\",\"I am getting Garbled output when serial printing thru Windows & works etc.  This has occurred on several systems and goes if a LaserJet 4 is used.

I'm sure its not JUST me with this problem.  Thanks for reading....  John Atherton       \",\" A professor of mine once said \\\"The difference between a Computer Engineer and a Computer Scientist is about $5000\\\" meaning the Engineer makes $5000 more than the CS. Seriously though the main difference is that most CS people write programs that people will use, i.e. database, graphics, word processors, etc., while an engineer writes for machines or control systems, i.e. the \\\"computer\\\" in your car, a flight control system, computer controled devices, etc. In other words CS writes SOFTWARE while CSE writes FIRMWARE.  These are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is.\",\" I don't want to get into a semantic argument, but contrary to some other postings \\\"near UV light\\\" /is/ \\\"actual UV light.\\\"  The \\\"near\\\" means that it is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength), not that it is \\\"nearly UV.\\\"  (I'm sure you can figure out now just what \\\"far UV\\\" is.)  Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the visible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.  It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to be useful, but not dangerously so.\",\" Actually, Messier was invited, but declined due to nagging injuries...

If they blast away a few good fokes then that is : :With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with :mega fire power. They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few  I hope this is a joke... if not, here's my response:  The BATF has a history of no-knock raids with poor evidence, often resulting in innocent people being killed or suffering injury to person or property.  I will NOT support the BATF until they clean up their act... Maybe...  As to equipment, the BATF has damn near anything it wants...  Their faults were in intelligence (military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during DAYLIGHT??), methodology (the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assault a position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting negotiations first), and legality.  The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms and tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They have very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the child-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco issues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with no violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, then the FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agent in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence, murder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the  public what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault on American citizens.  And while on the issue of investigating this issue, the Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated for BATF wrongdoing.

The moderator of the firearms-politics mailing list, Karl Kleinpaste, has agreed to set up an anonymous ftp archive directory for RKBA related information.  This directory can be used for things like articles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions, the RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It's not meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.  So, in the future if you're looking for something check there first and then ask here.  Instructions:  Short version for techies:  The site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the directory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands get, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command \\\"type binary\\\" to be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved to the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.  I will maintain an index which you should get first to check if the file you want to read or write already is archived.  Long version for non-techies:  In order for you to use this archive your computer must be on the Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:   ftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu  If that doesn't work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp command is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a login:  Name (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):  Instead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:   ftp  Next you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:   Guest login ok, send e-mail address as password:  I would enter:   l.v.cipriani@att.com  You'll enter your own e-mail address.  You'll get these lines or similar as output:   Remote system is UNIX.  Using binary mode to transfer files.  Next, the command prompt is printed:   ftp>   If you do not get the line \\\"Using binary mode to transfer files.\\\" Run the command:   type binary  Now you're logged in to the archive machine.  There are many directories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are   /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba and  /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming  There are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.  When you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:   cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba or  cd pub/firearms/politics/rkba  To submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with the command:   cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming or  cd pub/firearms/politics/incoming  Once you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter another command.  To find the names of the existing files in the directory you are in run the command:   ls -l  This will produce something like:  total 6021 -r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP -r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX -r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies -r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361 -r--r--r--  1 karl          8958 Jun 16  1992 WSJ_Crimestrike -r--r--r--  1 karl          2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias -r--r--r--  1 karl           935 Mar 22 22:38 academics -r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu ... and so on ...  Each line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields are the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of the file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need to be concerned with.  To get a file run the command \\\"get\\\" followed by the name of the file you want, for example:   get INDEX or  get noduty  After the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:   Transfer complete.  19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)  You can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive. You can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the file you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025 you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it:   cd congress/103rd  get HR1025  Once you're finished you can log off with the command:   quit  If you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little different.  First of all you should find out if the file already exists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  The index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba directory.  For example:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- File: whitemanslaw  White Man's Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985 Reason magazine ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Once you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login and change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once you are in the incoming directory use the command:   put file_name  In this case:   put whitemanslaw  Again there'll be a \\\"Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered in so many seconds\\\" message.  Now your file is on the archive machine.  Another thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure there isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same as the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'll overwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message].  Your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory.  Once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for the INDEX file and I will add it to the file.  If you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and I'll take care of the rest.  If you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so be sure to let me know first.  If you have any questions feel free to ask me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --  Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com     \",\" The Orion concept as actually proposed (as opposed to the way it has been somewhat misrepresented in some fiction) included wrapping a thick layer of reaction mass -- probably plastic of some sort -- around each bomb.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability      of these products.         \",\"Can someone send me ticket ordering information for the following teams:  Baltimore, Philadelphia and Boston.

It was largely the mainstream Christian's disgust #at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred.  True, but that is exactly the \\\"problem\\\": the Mormon extermination order was issued not just by a Christian, it was ALLOWED under the Constitution of the United States, which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents like this \\\"order\\\" from occurring in the first place...  As I indicated in an earlier posting, your \\\"irrational hatred\\\" is clearly evidenced by individuals like Robert Weiss (who could have been Gov. Boggs' Lieutenant; he would have fitted right in, drewling et al), and seems a modern-day occurrence, based on results (slander, persecution, misrepresentation, lies, denying Mormons representation in their own user group, etc. etc.  In intent and purpose, what really has changed?  #The situation is not entirely different today.  Many irrational feelings #and beliefs are justified through religion.  I don't think most of them #are started because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and #perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification #which discourages critical thought.

It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you #badly must have been done primarily for that purpose.  What I mean is that secular authorities are to be watched, as we believe that Satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert truth, judgment, and justice.  In addition, we believe that the adversary has power to influence the unjust and idolatrous (greed for money would be a good example) in order to bring about persecution, war, oppression, and evil combinations.  As an intelligent being, don't you suppose that the destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power?

No.  Computer speed is only partly dependent of processor/clock speed. Memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and I/O speed.  As processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed.  If you have a 50MHz processor, it can be reading another word from memory every 20ns.  Sure, you can put all 20ns memory in your computer, but it will cost 10 times as much as the slower 80ns SIMMs.  And roughly, the 68040 is twice as fast at a given clock speed as is the 68030. \",\" Did your boyfriend comment on the fact that Clement looks like a walking ad for Brillo pad hair replacement therapy?

Mitchell                           March 23, 1993   INTRODUCTION:   In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment purposes. Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of a lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in Twenty-First century remote learning methods.   Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures, interfacing and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at the LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real facility exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves.   This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:  - tele-operations and virtual reality research  - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation  - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers  - art and theater  - bbs and online network users  - software and game developers  - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains  - children  - the child in all of us   LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:   A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth. The \\\"floor\\\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and machine-lets.    The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:  1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;  2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and  3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.    Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on  it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture  content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent  to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.   The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to LTM1.   Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the SSTO to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar landscape and land.   Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.   By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours.   PLAN OF ACTION:   The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network. Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \\\"rail stock\\\" for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets. An initial \\\"ground breaking\\\" with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution world-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony.   A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return to their campus.   A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media. Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community. Especially since the \\\"action\\\" will be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be invited to issue \\\"challenges\\\" to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.   The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education, experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a long term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!   CONCLUSION:   EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create world-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require real (not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in space.

How should I do it? A: You would be wise not to copyprotect that program.  You see, those     people that wants to get a cracked copy of your program will go to     various length to crack your program, and some of those crackers     are good, and know the common tricks.    So, the copy protection wouldn't stop those.    Ok, then.  What about legitimate users?  Copy protection can be a hassle    for legitimate users, and can hinder them in their work, expecially    if there is some \\\"key\\\" item that can get lost.    So, the copy protection wouldn't help much of the legitimate users, but    would make life somewhat of a misery for them.

Friday, May 7, 1993 Hyatt Regency - Crystal City Hotel Arlington, VA  ABOUT THE CONFERENCE The Low-Cost Lunar Access conference will be a forum for the exchange of ideas on how to initiate and structure an affordable human lunar program. Inherent in such low-cost programs is the principle that they be  implemented rapidly and meet their objectives within a short time frame.  [more deleted]  CONFERENCE PROGRAM (Preliminary)  In the Washington Room:    9:00 - 9:10 a.m.     Opening Remarks     Dr. Alan M. Lovelace    9:10 - 9:30 a.m.     Keynote Address     Mr. Brian Dailey    9:30 - 10:00 a.m.    U.S. Policy Outlook     John Pike, American Federation of Scientists    A discussion of the prospects for the introduction of a new low-cost   lunar initiative in view of the uncertain direction the space   program is taking.    10:00 - 12:00 noon   Morning Plenary Sessions    Presentations on architectures, systems, and operational concepts.   Emphasis will be on mission approaches that produce significant   advancements beyond Apollo yet are judged to be affordable in the   present era of severely constrained budgets   In the Potomac Room    12:00 - 1:30 p.m.    Lunch     Guest Speaker: Mr. John W.

Too bad I can't go.\",\"    Humanist, or sub-humanist? :-)\",\"...   It's amazing how everyone automatically blames one side or the other.  One thing for sure:  Koresh will have no chance to defend himself  against the statements (lacking in fact or COurt sponsored verification)  made  by agents who participated in the situation that killed him.    I don't know they murdered him; I also don't know   that the Branch Davidians set a fire and suicidede.    It is SICK of BATF or FBI spokepeople to make such   comments in advance of forensic pathology.   Stephen:  thank you.  God speed.      Yah.    BINGO.  Am I the only one  to notice:  a) No peaceful attempt to serve a warrant.  b) Six months to develop a scene and six days to end it?  c) .... ah God:     25 children    at least 64 adults    plus 6 at the beginning    and more BATF agents     all dead.    Has anyone asked themselves these questions:   1)  Have you seen the ENTIRE video sequences taken during the    opening rounds?  I seem to recall missing several key parts:   a)  The first five minutes of day one; only the shooting     part comes out.   b)  What happened to the Feds video units?  You mean they do     not carry helmet cams?  Wonder why not?  2)   How is it you can have camera crews with live transmission    video present and NOT have an uninterrupted record?    a)  You realize the units carry ittle bitty 8mm backups?    That hold 90 minutes per unit?  And there are    twounits on the professional handhelds (so no    tape turnover gaps)?   b)  Until all views are seen, it is premature to point    fingers in either direction.   As you well point out, Stephen.    More on this below.    Yes.  But it is so hard toremain human under the full  pressure of hazard, game playing, and life.    More to the point:  when someone dies (almost like it was intended  that way), both sides will kill to maintain their innocence --   a contradiction in terms.    True.  Usually I pick the unpopular side and point out  from the evidence seen what might have alternatively happened.    This requires someone interested in God's Will.  Please note  that the outstanding _overt_ problem in this country today  is one where the Government:    wants Caesar's coin to pay off the debt.    Yes:  The AMerican People.  Not the Federal Government.  ANd if it is not spent towards that end, _no_one_ deserves  the coin.     Yah.  Fewpeople hear the contradiction:    Money   made   in the image   of God    I wish you were wrong.  Many pundits are saying 3 years.  The onyl good thing to come out of my divorce (and my  exposure to the Damned (pardon me) American Divorce Attorney  is:    I have no money left to lose to taxes or inflation.    25 children dead.  If anyone thinks blaming Koresh -- or the BATF  helps this any at all, is sick.  and wrong.    The reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely   straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences   havew made ANY comments about even the POSSIBILITY that   Koresh or his followers caused this.    The BATF agentss are more concerned with their repuations   and morals (\\\"not my fault, Koresh did it!\\\") than they   are with:     25 dead children.   Same goes for Koresh & his followers - who are all (mostly) dead.    More on power and favoritism.  (My personal opinion).   Look to history:  whenever privilege has replaced whatever  token of objective law and justice a society has had,    Hitlerrs have followed.    You do your name sake proud, Stephen.  Its hard, but please keep on keeping on:   each voice in the wilderness now will   save a generation unborn from horror    The day I _need_ a gun or abomb to protect myself in this  society is the day that society is already beyond redemption    and that aint' redundant, if you have any Christian   belief aytall.   ... and the day that I cannot peacefully enjoin others in the  act that Thoreau called Civil Disobedience to rectify the  wrongs that my society practises, without undue harm or  punishment befalling me, is the day that society has ceased to  be a human society, and become a society of animals.    We are _very_ cclose to that.    Six years fighting an unjust COurt issue:  still struggling to be  patient.  For those who like contrary questions:   NB:  I was not there.  I am not a Branch Davidian nor a     law  official hater.  I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same.  The official side has its advocates already; lets balance the  equation and asj a few questions on the other side, for the sake  of an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass:    innocent until proven guilty.  not   innocent until presumed guilty.   1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.    Don't tell me they do not exist.  They are standard   equipment.   2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?    a)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This     aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable     as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.     .... gotcha!      ... when in isolation from other substances.      WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote     launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce \\\"this window,     blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come     down\\\", and maintain a left to right sequence?    b)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when     mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)     suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to     brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long     exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend     to ignite.     What other chemicals come up in the forensics?    Who else will be allowed to test the site?    c)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation     rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made     to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature     above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain     heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length     of time (start a wall fire and wait).     Check your military records; look at the tapes.    Why were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),    tear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why    the hurry. was there still a comm channel open    to the outside?).     Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the    compound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones    are missing?   Do I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.  You trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?   IN advance of a Court?  God help us.    (For we are surely not helping ourselves).  You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?    You are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.   Look again.   Did it happen that way?  I do not know.  I was not there.   AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE.  But will that happen?  89 people will NOT have the chance   to tell their side as the BATF leader was, on camera.  No one wins.  Except:  more force next time.   Listen to your hearts, people.

Yet again, the use of this newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge of.  For cites on MSG, look up almost anything by John W. Olney, a toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on development.  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an excitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamate is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain (humans included).  Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown off.  Glutamate and aspartate, also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts, and are freely available in many foods, but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food.  By eating lots of junk food, packaged soups, and diet soft drinks, it is possible to jack your blood levels so high, that anyone with a sensitivity to these compounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects.  Read Olney's review paper in Prog. Brain Res, 1988, and check *his* sources. They are impecable. There is no dispute.\",\"   Thanks again.  One final question.

Strangely, even when I have smartdrive installed, every DIR command accesses the disk.  Did I somehow de-activate the cache?

The cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military  in communications, intelligence gathering and firepower.   In a similar vein, the amount of marijuana smuggled into  this country has greatly decreased. This is because its  value-per-pound is very low when compared to cocaine or  heroin. It's simply not worth the risk, it's uneconomical.  Now, most reefer is domestic. There is less pressure on  the domestic producer (showy raids notwithstanding) and  thus it is economical. Of note though ... domestic reefer  is now very strong, so a small volume goes a long way.  You cannot make alcohol stronger than 200 proof - not a  good dollar/pound deal. \",\"Could some kind soul tell me the advance timing/revs for a 1981 xs1100 special (bought in Canada).\",\" I can't answer most of your questions, but I've seen it happen in  family members who are being treated with radiation and/or chemotherapy.

Can you recommend any good books, journals, or microstrip circuit design software. . all help appreciated\",\"  My whole point was not to say that the cars *couldn't* go that fast, but that they *shouldn't* go that fast.  A family sedan designed to be operable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because you added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much larger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the *brakes.*  The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power plant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications. I have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a brick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I personally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is inadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of the car is not up to par.  I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these cars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.  There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought it up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe the following to be true:  1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here. 2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than    they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them    far more predictable than most US highways. 3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have    speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in    the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not    much higher than 120km/h.  I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph (nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.  Some people have no respect for their own lives.    If you think so you sure don't pay attention to my postings.\",\"     I don't doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders. It's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology, and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, the proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what exists now.      The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs, probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say) a DES keysearch machine.      As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination could acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since it would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked jodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency or organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak- nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for (say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the complaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars to build a keysearch machine for.)      How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?  How about home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers? \\\"Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately. Maybe I can help...\\\"        Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistant to \\\"practical cryptanalysis.\\\"  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how several NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.  And NSA confidential data was *not* subject to being requested by thousands of police organizations and courts across the land.\",\"To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota:    From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people  in the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St.  Paul \\\"Pioneer Press\\\" wrote an article giving the \\\"inside scoop\\\" on the  issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible  candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic  Center (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty  confident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will  ultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other  two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the  inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name)  believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also,  because of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed  until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.   However, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed,  because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for  conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to  this mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future  viability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even  further.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of  knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging  Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met,  which may happen.  Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are  Hartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \\\" Ice Demons?\\\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't  been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the  Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in  as many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see  Hartford and Tampa show up there either. So, Minnesota may end up  getting another team, but it may take a few years.     Go Sabres!\",\"  *nnnnnnnng* Thank you for playing, I cannot agree with this.  I believed this and to put it nicely, it was a piece of junk!  I loved this car, I babied it, I pampered it, and after 2 years, it just couldn't stay together, I would say that not everyone will have the problems that I had, but know this, it's not just the car, it is the ability to get the car fixed, which will NOT happen at any chrysler/dodge/take your pick dealer.  I don't care if there are going to reform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe it when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up, just looking, you don't even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10) salesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you, and try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards. Service is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but they tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of work/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care of this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took it to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn't have been.  1988 Dodge Shadow ES  These were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.  Engine  4 Alternators Rear Suspension Torsion Bar 2 Water pumps 5 thermostats Hall effect sensor Main computer 4 Batteries  These were rebuilt/repaired  Radiator Automatic Transmission Power Steering   Those are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  For about a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it's a good car, I just can't find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I traded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I just stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000 worth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite me.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the hell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.  You can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but Japanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I feel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler product again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I will admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM isn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do their divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.    Don't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a hawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car is really good, until it has proved itself to me.  But since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because I used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good thing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were they moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend always thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.  And although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I will use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink with the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the shadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the chrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just average.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You can find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched the Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal of information about this company, just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for good reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I think this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in Toyota said and I quote, \\\"We are watching them very closely.\\\"  Come on, everybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been kicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to set in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They are still struggling because they haven't learned yet.  They have the ability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date, but their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.  It's called competition gentleman/women if you don't satisfy the demand of the consumer, well your out..    *asbestos suit on*\",\"  For that matter, it shouldn't be that difficult to design a black box that gives off EMR similar to a monitor with gibberish on the screen....     \",\" We all know this will never happen.

Opinion polls show that most people belive the Bill of Rights to grant too much freedom to people, when it is not identified as such (BTW, if anyone knows of a cite for that, I'd love to have it).  Not only does this mean that these people are  willing to give up everyone (else's) rights, they don't even know what  the Bill of Rights actually says.  How can we show the average person (not the average USENET reader) that people are actually entitiled to these rights?  So many people don't care if the government is taking more and more control of us all, a little  at a time.  \",\" OK, here's at least one Christian's answer:  Jesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes sense.  Matt 5:17 \\\"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\\\"  Jesus lived under the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises of the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey God's purposes.  Verse 18 says \\\"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law, until all is accomplished.\\\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last  phrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \\\"accomplished\\\" what the  Law was supposed to accomplish.    Verse 19:  \\\"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\\\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish  people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.  In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he  must have received about \\\"doing away with the Law.\\\"  That was not  Jesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it  should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his  people all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your  heel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \\\"doing  away with the Law\\\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as  equal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious  leaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only  God's Law.  In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law  and defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon  on the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people  understand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which  had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.  In Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the  Law in this way:  [23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being  shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore  the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be  justified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no  longer under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith  in Christ Jesus.  I believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had  served it's purpose, i.e. \\\"our tutor to lead us to Christ,\\\" and now, \\\"we are no longer under a tutor.\\\"  The law has been \\\"fulfilled\\\"  as Christ said he would do.  God, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same personality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \\\"last will and testament\\\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles.  It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are re-expressed in Christianity.   On the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and  Christians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes  sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to  represent the \\\"mysteries\\\" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism  representing Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8), The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff, Acts 20:7)  OK, That's one Christian's explanation.

No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if you're grounded in some other way at the same time.    The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.    They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere, repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.)  What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact, depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.  There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers.

Anyway...)   The basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of Mary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles  and all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were present when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days later, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was still unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There was no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their   preaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently  considered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the apostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of the assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.\",\"   Let me add another of my concerns: Yes, I can buy a port of Motif for \\\"cheap\\\", but I cannot get the source for \\\"cheap\\\", hence I am limited to using whatever X libraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of Motif.

On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available.    The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5.

Here is some  information \\\"from the horse's mouth\\\".  (Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (\\\"clearing\\\") meant to  be *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying  the material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,)  From National Telecommunications and Information Systems  Security (NTISS) \\\"Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation  Security Guidelines\\\"  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87):  ------  \\\"7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk,  cassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the  entire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be  cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that overwrites  each location with a given character.  Fixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting  at least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by  applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each  location on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that  this program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware:  some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not  actually do this.  Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or  released for destruction; however, they should be marked and  controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of  information ever recorded.  7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a  degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of  that type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)  If a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is  operative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to  employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all  addressable locations at least three times by writing any character,  then its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros)  alternatively.  When fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify  the media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two  alternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk  pack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved  degaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the  vendor's facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter)  removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for  destruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new  platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.  7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media\\\"  [see DoD Computer Security Center, \\\"Department of Defense Magnetic  Remanence Security Guideline\\\", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE  ONLY]  ------  This and many other interesting documents (many that are more  informative than probably intended) on computer security procedures  can be obtained (free) from:  Executive Secretary National Telecommunications and Informations   Systems Security Committee National Security Agency Fort George G.

Goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal (Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau), but Buffalo has no answer to Neely (not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's one of my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin :) ).  And the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway.  But I think it will go six.   Agreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, or does everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!  Final  I can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for 6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play in the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear territorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will not be putting money on this series. :-)    Agreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent of the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is credit to NY.   Agreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent team, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.   I think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don't think it will go six either...*maybe* five.   If Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They own the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once again I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the Habs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.    Chicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good, IMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.   Very true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out why Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three  at MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.   It _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all.  And yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.    Our first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their size *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team chasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.   This is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough.  I don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a non-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate Gretzky.  LA in six.   If it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be LA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.   Wow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I picked LA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.   If Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet against the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong because they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose, though, I'd have to take the Penguins.  A side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than Gilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from the age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team. I'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while he and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge), Gilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp. from Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill.

Move to Canada.  Yesterday I was able to watch FOUR games...the NJ-PITT at 1:00 on ABC, LA-CAL at 3:00 (CBC),  BUFF-BOS at 7:00 (TSN and FOX), and MON-QUE at 7:30 (CBC).  I think that if each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd consecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess).  I have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE and keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two afternoon games.  Btw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemed to know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore and they did an excellent job.  They were quite impartial also, IMO.  \",\"  So does that mean that anyone who is a Christian to avoid Hell isn't really a Christian at all? It sounds like it to me.

Above, Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre science that makes smaller steps.  In most of this thread, I have been concerned with the difference between what is science and what is not.   Lee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between Einstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of their thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts are scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or Korzybski as examples.  If you don't like these, choose your own.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong. Both Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to do this.    Let me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked to review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many kinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is that the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of criticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either not important or not interesting.  The first difference is the one that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the one that Lee Lady seems to be discussing.    I have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered  scientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims, not just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect that traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work; what it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the presence of qi.   Certainly a \\\"theoretical structure that makes sense\\\" is the goal. In areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with forming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Let's face it: we cannot always wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything clear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. \",\" It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.  I can even imagine this being found legal and constitutional, since nothing is actually listened to until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained.  Imagine archiving all pay-phone conversations, so if someone turns out to be a drug dealer, you can listen to all their past drug deals.  And archive calls to/from suspected Mafia members, potential terrorists, radicals, etc.  Imagine the convenience for the police of being able to get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the World Trade Center bombers made in the past year.  Since archiving would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do, why wouldn't it happen?\",\"I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc. It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you very much).   well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell me the order of the wires.   there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.   if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.   btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of little boxes). Oh, well . . .   one more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus--- you're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in other words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible. it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order.   omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution so others can, too. thanx for the input.\",\"THE WHITE HOUSE                    Office of the Press Secretary                    (Pittsburgh, Pennslyvania) ______________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                         April 17, 1993                                       RADIO ADDRESS TO THE NATION                          BY THE PRESIDENT                               Pittsburgh International Airport                     Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania                             10:06 A.M. EDT                                          THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to you this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio station in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to meet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs, health care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly broadcast with the American people.                             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when it reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past seven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with the people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus tour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last year's campaign.                            Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with you, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and what I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting to you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.                            You sent me to Washington to get our government and economy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad experiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important it is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do business.                              We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations rise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness of their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the cooperative experience and spirit that exists between business, labor and government.  Although many of the economies of the industrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've made many of the smart investments and the tough choices which our government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them have been moving ahead and too many of our people have been falling behind.                            We have an economy today that even when it grows is not producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation by four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to show for it.  We know that wages of most working people have stopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks and that too many families can no longer afford the escalating cost of health care.                            But we also know that, given the right tools, the right incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and businesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy needs to expand opportunity and to make our communities better places to live.                            In many critical products today Americans are the low cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that we create more of those kinds of jobs.                            Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for long-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old priorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to be -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs and education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the waste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious resources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the groundwork for robust economic growth in the future.                            These new directions passed the Congress in record time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our country.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would create hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private sector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It now has the support of a majority of the United States Senate.  But it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the Senate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know would result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.                            The issue isn't politics; the issue is people.  Millions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and counting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill has been grounded by gridlock.                              I know the American people are tired of business as usual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin or wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have taken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra mile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25 percent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.                              It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million Americans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill languish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean hundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to act to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking this initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I think we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant portion of our original goals.                            First, we want to keep the programs as much as possible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs, including highway and road construction, summer jobs for young people, immunization for children, construction of waste water sites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding for extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who have been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't creating jobs.                            Second, I've recommended that all the other programs in the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40 percent.                            And third, I've recommended a new element in this program to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against crime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire police officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put them back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight for a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it and deserve it.                            Now, the people who are filibustering this bill -- the Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it increases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this year that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable, doesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more than paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this budget is well within the spending limits already approved by the Congress this year.                            It's amazing to me that many of these same senators who are filibustering the bill voted during the previous administration for billions of dollars of the same kind of emergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the American people to work.                              This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered a plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities are -- on people or on politics.                              Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar for dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the soundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our children.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs and investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of us when we've helped make more American partners working to ensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.                            You know, if every American who wanted a job had one, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this country today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first step to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country again.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid for over the life of our budget.                            Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how important the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.                            Good morning, and thank you for listening.\",\" Well, maybe it will be.

These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me.  1.      Is it true that many arab countries don't recognize Israeli nationality ?  That people with Israeli stamps on their passports can't enter arabic countries?  2.      Is it true that arabic countries such as Jordan and Syria have undefined borders and that arab governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of their states should be?  3.      Is it true that arab countires refused to sign the Chemical weapon convention treaty in Paris in 1993?  4.      Is it true that in arab prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ?  4a. Is it true that some arab countries, like Syria, harbor Nazi war criminals, and refuse to extradite them?  4b. Is it true that some arab countries, like Saudi Arabia, prohibit women from driving cars?  5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the Muslim countries are subject to different laws than Muslims?  6.      Is it true that arab countries confiscated the property of entire Jewish communites forced to flee by anti-Jewish riots?  7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed a chemical weapons treaty that no arab nation was willing to sign?  8.      Is it true that Syrian Jews are required to leave a $10,000 deposit before leaving the country, and are no longer allowed to emmigrate, despite promises made by Hafez Assad to George Bush?  9.  Is it true that Jews in Muslim lands are required to pay a special tax, for being Jews?  10.     Is it true that Intercontinental Hotel in Jerusalem was built on a Jewish cemetary, with roads being paved over grave sites, and gravestones being used in Jordanian latrines?  11. Is it really cheesy and inappropriate to post lists of biased leading questions?  11a. Is it less appropriate if information implied in Mr. Davidsson's questions is highly misleading?

During the second  Imlach era, when Darryl Sittler was called a \\\"cancer on the team\\\", he tore the C off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain.  Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly captaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead, Sittler got traded to Detroit.  Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and they took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago.  During Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach, in an  attempt  to  kiss the  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman, the Leafs took the A away from Brad Marsh to give to Leeman.  Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  tried to give it back to Marsh, he wouldn't take it neither.  The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late of the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably one of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  of playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be- came the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a captain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the players.  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  making sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.   -- \",\"The 4/100 prints out the following message about it's framebuffer  cgtwo0 at vme24d16 0x400000 vec 0xa8  cgtwo0: Sun-3 color board, fast read  Anybody know the story on this? --  - Can I have an IMPULSE ITEM instead?\",\"  I find this argument very strange, though not unfamiliar.  An analogy someone used a while back can perhaps illustrate it.  Say, for example, there are people living on a volcanic island, and a group  of geologists determine that a volcano is imminent. They warn the people on  the island that they are in danger, and should leave. A group of people on  the island is given the task of warning others of the danger.  They believe the danger is real, but others may not.   Does that mean that the first group are NECESSARILY arrogant in warning  others of the danger? Does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs  are correct, and all others are false?

Ms. Friedman  gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup,  (even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to  minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine  and drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank  her for an entertaining evening.    ANNUAL MEETING  In addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is  also the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official  notice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main  purpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit  member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and  to elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two  year term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following  slate for the Board.           Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen          Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith          Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia          Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)          Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)          Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)          David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)  Those remaining on the Board for another year are:           Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)          Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn          Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy          Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)          Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)          Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)  This may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work  and with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have  backups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition  to the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also  be accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board  members and there is plenty of work.   In addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be  given and the floor will be open for any new business,  suggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.  We will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the  majority of the time with Dr. Teperman.  FUTURE MEETINGS  Remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.         May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry                   Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center       June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony                    Brook Kidney Transplant Program.   Plan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.  NOTDAW  The week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor  Awareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases,  speaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and  Gaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game    because of two year's experience with miserable weather.   We all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We  have found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish  a letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to  address the congregation, or include mention of the gift of  life in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample  letter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.  DR. STARZL TO BE HONORED   The Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will  hold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the  Fountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas  Starzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and  are going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne  Treffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.  MEMBERSHIP NEWS   Congratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant  in Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing  well after only 12 days in hospital.  Arthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston  Marathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation  works!  We hope the national press notices.        Bob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his  transplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis  and feeling better.    Nicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie,  spent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems  encountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida.   They are back in New York where Nicole's treatment will  continue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery.   Kay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall  that resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a  candidate for the Board so we need her well soon.   And best wishes to all coming out of the flu. It was a tough  winter for many, but the tulips are just under the snow.\",\"Posting for a friend: please call Steve, 415 252-1618, if interested.

Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who                themselves has AIDS..it is unlikely (not impossible) they will get AIDS          from acupuncture needles. Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant  involved with acupuncture needle insertion.   Most acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They       do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of  diseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise \\\"disposable needlesused here.\\\" These needles tend to be of a lower quality however,  being poorly manufactured and too \\\"sharp\\\" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                         If I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get  their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.       The risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly  use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong               patient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates  this risk. Better quality needles tend to \\\"slide\\\" past vessels and             nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                         Acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all  solid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into  meridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require  the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be  injected into the body as it would  be in a typical \\\"shot.\\\" when the skin is  puntured. On the other hand when the solid  acupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to \\\"squeeze\\\" the needle  from the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that  haven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain  on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior.   Of course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory  and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture  site.   While I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease  transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for  what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful. \",\"The title says it all...If you have some cheap used  GAMEBOY or TG-16 (2 Player or more) Games, Please email me all offers...\",\"   Actually, that is no longer true.

The SAE numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature  5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.  Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.  Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).  In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something.  Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature,  but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.    If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives, stick to the 10W40.  \",\" I feel like Winston Churchill in 1941 :( ...... but, the privacy Clipper will, TO THE EXTENT KEY ESCROW IS LEGITIMATE, stop most of the abuse of wiretaps by local cops, company cops, angry husbands/ wives, etc...

X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X * The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X   and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X   It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X   incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X   consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X * The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X   to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()  X   using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X * You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X   it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the  X   ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same  X   title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be  X   sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X * With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above  X   format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X   something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X   Email message to the judges. X X * Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless  X   'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X * To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X   each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X   should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X * The entry's remarks should include: X     - what this program does X     - how to run the program (sample args or input) X     - special compile or execution instructions, if any X     - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X     - information about any ---data--- files X     - why you think the program is obfuscated X     - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X     - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X * Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X   portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They  X   should not be required to exist. X X   If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X   section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple  X   ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X   each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X    'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X    'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X        digit, followed by '.c' X    your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X        title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not  X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to: X X  ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate X  obfuscate@toad.com X X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'. X X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however.

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers  X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with  X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor  X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X * look at the original source X * convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X * run it through a C beautifier X * examine the algorithm X * lint it X * compile it X * execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting \\\"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake\\\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X #define d define X #d foo     <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X int i; X j;     <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you  X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in  X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X int i; X char *c; X i[c];     <--- use c[i] instead X (i+3)[\\\"string\\\"];   <--- use \\\"string\\\"[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X * assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X * casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X * passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X * passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X * performing arithmetic on va_list variables X * using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X * are very hardware specific X * are very OS or Un*x version specific X      (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X       code is likely not to be) X * dump core or have compiler warnings X      (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X * won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X * abusing the build file to get around the size limit X * obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X * are longer than they need to be X * are similar to previous winners X * are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X * are as concise and small as they need to be X * do something at least quasi-interesting X * pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X * are portable X * are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X * MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X * make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X where this program differs from the contest rules, the X contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule: 1993 Xfix: n Xtitle: chonglab Xentry: 0 Xdate: Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost: Un*x v6, pdp11/45 X 2.9BSD, pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

If an entry wins, we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition, X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award, X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X * Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X * Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X  cc prog.c -o special_name  need special binary X X     or  rm -f special_src.c   need special source X  cp prog.c special_src.c X  cc special_src.c -o special_name X X     or  rm -f special_build   need special build X  tail +4 build > special_build X  sh < special_build X X * Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of  X   your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You  X   should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the  X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X     X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer  X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as  X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many  X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X date -u \\\"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\\\" X date -u | sed -e 's/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/' X sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X ---entry--- section X all ---author--- sections X all ---info--- sections X ---build--- section X ---program--- section X any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X * reading the ---entry--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X * passing the source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X * performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X * passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X * linting the source X * compiling/building the source X * running the program X * performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X * best small one line program X * best small program X * strangest/most creative source layout X * most useful obfuscated program X * best game that is obfuscated X * most creatively obfuscated program X * most deceptive C code X * best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X * best abuse of ANSI C X * worst abuse of the rules X * <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry  X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,  X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X     comp.lang.c    comp.unix.wizards alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X     comp.sources.d   alt.sources.d  misc.misc X     comp.sources.misc   comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we   agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.   When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could   get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he   started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had   miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed   another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was   their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I   reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be   treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole   deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,   snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by   the turn of events.  Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting   to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and   asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him   that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,   that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs   and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still   pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to   lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told   him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.  A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all   apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus   knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about   it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,   and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....  I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we   decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him   back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the   truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the   incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of   there in my new truck in about 30 mins.  So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not   have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales   person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I   sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their   mistake.  Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred   dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.

So that the non-muslim readers of this group will see how far from  the simple basics of Islam such views are on the face of them. And  if they are _not_ in contradiction with the basics of Islam, how  subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while  they are explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an.     In my opinion considering any human being as having a substance or metaphysical fundamentally different from that of any other human being _is_ a heretical notion and one proscribed by Islam.      Absolutely! I would be interested in discussing this privately and I am interested in hearing how one might try to make the concept of error-free and sinless human beings philosophically consistent with the teachings of the Qur'an. However, _prima facie_ such attemptsa are highly susceptible to degenerating into monkery, explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an.

Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished  of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only  the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian  Armenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of  Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines  genocide as acting with a     'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a     national, ethnic, racial or religious group.'   History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate  the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the  Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including  U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy  as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of  the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the  extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor  those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians.   The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established, beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian  territories.  The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed. The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian  Government.  The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were Dro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri, Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.

Unlike  bandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People that cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are afraid to be associated with something negative.   On this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP's is  because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top. If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people  for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had  conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any better/worse than the whites did.  The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of the world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done (ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the present generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do  any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped hundreds, even thousands, of years ago.   My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's change them. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settle anything anyway.   That's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just because they are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school and after high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make you right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only a couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, not to yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care how you appear (ie. a Winner).   If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \\\"At that moment the bottom fell out of Authur's mind.

The scribe Matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's main strategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even about the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in the New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at least 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much happened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we will take particular claims at face value.  Immanuel:         We begin, of course, at the beginning.         (Mt 1.21-22):  \\\"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,        Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is        salvation), for he will save his people from their        sins.\\\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had        spoken by a prophet:         [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),        king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made        war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not        quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz        and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its        heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the        lord G'd said to Isaiah, \\\"go to meet with Ahaz...\\\"         ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,        naturally) saying, \\\"Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It        can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\\\"  But,        Ahaz said, \\\"I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a        test.\\\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \\\"Hear then, O house of        David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that        you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord        himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman        is with child and will bear a son, and name him        \\\"Immanuel,\\\" which means, \\\"G'd is with us.\\\"   He will        eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil        and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to        refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings        you dread will have been deserted...  Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics.  Further, he the Hebrew word \\\"almah,\\\" (young woman), as specifically, \\\"virgin.\\\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the Messiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years later.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In short, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of context, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary, virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course, the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by later Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by the name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy for Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second class prophecy.   Not too convincing.  Egypt:         After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a quick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he wishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.         [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of        Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:        \\\"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\\\"   What the lord really said was this.         [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him.         And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called        them (my people), the more they went from me; they        kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning        incense to idols.  Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it was indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to return.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of here.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind up with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.  Rachel Weeps:          While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that King Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of all young male children.  Matthew then writes,         [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the        prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:         \\\"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud        lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;        she refused to be consoled, because they were        no more.\\\"     The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722 BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim, and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \\\"no more.\\\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.        It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who was the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and Bethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \\\"children,\\\" it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city, \\\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\\\"        As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely that such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible, nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time.  Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a prime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance the message of the church's gospel.        Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the infant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set up by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus. It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \\\"children\\\" the prophet speaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd comforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be returned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this would not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are dead for good.  Again, the \\\"prophecy\\\" Matthew sets up is not even that, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too convincing.  The Nazarene:         We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth,          [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets        might be fulfilled, \\\"He shall be called a Nazarene.\\\"  First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of the prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \\\"He\\\" is.  There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse, there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still worse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at all.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that she will,         [Judges 13.5]  \\\"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor        shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his        god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel        from the hands of the Philistines.\\\"  This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd.  But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has begun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is simple making them up now.  Bearing our Diseases:         Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and disabilities.         [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the        prophet Isaiah, \\\"He took our infirmities and bore our        diseases.\\\"  As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context, and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,         [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has        borne our sickness, and carried our pains.  From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the Israelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish identity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the instrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.       The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and discipline.  They do not speak of a \\\"servant\\\" going around and healing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus, as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but rather something that had already happened.  While it is believed that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear the illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say that, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his spiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel misses where he intended it to have its effect.   Silent Messiah:        Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus ordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse the attention of the local rulers.         [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by        the prophet Isaiah.            \\\"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,        with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on        him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He        will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear        his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised        reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings        justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his        name.\\\"  The Isaiah passage quoted reads,         [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my        chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my        spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the        nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or        make it heard in the street.  He will not break a        bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will        faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail        (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has        established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands        await his law.  You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage, because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could never think of Jesus failing, never would the \\\"light\\\" of mankind burn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to an end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace G'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will be the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed from the Judaic \\\"...the coastlands await his law.\\\" to the Christologic, \\\"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\\\"   While the original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of \\\"believing in the name.\\\"  If one has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only to read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant, \\\"a people robbed and plundered...\\\"   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at \\\"prophecy\\\" is examined, it crumbles.  Three Days and Three Nights:        Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection.         [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the        whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son        of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and        three nights.  Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know how the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was 24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset 6pm.  What was referred to as a \\\"day\\\" was the period of light from 6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time scale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until 6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays.  (It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus, when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight portions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus, Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three nights.        As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \\\"ninth hour,\\\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the grave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \\\"rose,\\\" before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was over).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for clarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before 6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm Friday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two nights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this is a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to suspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little mistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his god's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more than unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.  Hearing & Understanding:       Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if you were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the message of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand them, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not accept the \\\"plain\\\" message any better.  Matthew says,         [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in        fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says,          \\\"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you        will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this        people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of        hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they        would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and        understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal        them.\\\"  The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his call to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is flourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria.  Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd, calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.         [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, \\\"Go, and say to this        people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and        see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this        people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their        eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear        with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and        turn and be healed.\\\"  Then Isaiah said, \\\"How long,        lord?\\\"  And he said, \\\"Until the cities lie waste        without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the        land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far        away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And        though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned        again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still        stands when the tree is felled.\\\" The holy seed is its        stump.  Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel to stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the promise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you read the rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look at Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)      We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion of Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that, he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't understand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are not prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the present.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face.        Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they have the prophetic approval.         [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a        parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the        prophet, \\\"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I        will utter that which has been hidden since the        foundation of the world.\\\"  Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a prophet, but from the Psalms.         [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will        utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have        heard and known, things that our fathers have told us.         We will not hide them from their children, but tell to        the coming generation the glorious deeds of the        lord...  As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come from a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies of Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet.  Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it up.      Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once again, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus has said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not understand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden.  Further, they speak of things \\\"known, that our fathers have told us.\\\"  Jesus deals with things \\\"hidden since the foundation of the world.\\\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion.  This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No wonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again, Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But, Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.   Excuses of Little Faith:         In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what epilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were possesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were unable to \\\"dispossess\\\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more enlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying they didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this demon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or he does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move mountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can move real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to Mexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old woman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.         And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their sacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in heaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.         Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time or a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the theologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see God anymore.         We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're        sinful; it's just his \\\"plan\\\"; we put too many of our        own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right        faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...       Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear reader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be true. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your heart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say our little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they say, \\\"See the love in these people you worship with... see the lives of people change... that is seeing G'd.\\\"   Thus people get lulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday sights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is not seeing G'd the way people used to see.         What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of human hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the forgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created by the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are what we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody has little faith.   Jesus Rides on an Ass:         Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah king, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into Jerusalem.           [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken        by the prophet, saying,         Tell the daughter of Zion, \\\"Behold, your king is        coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a        ass-colt.\\\"  Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little differently.         Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and        victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-        colt... he will command peace to the nations.  There isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah only involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the poetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two donkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological, proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written earlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to Jesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has bungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses, the situation is often reversed nowadays...         Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But, Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,         [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of        babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'  It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus was never one to point out such little \\\"prophetic\\\" things AND since, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to fit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or Matthew, \\\"Haven't you read?\\\" for the source reads,         [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is        your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is        chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you        have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the        enemy and the avenger.  The passages hardly need comment.  There is no \\\"perfect praise\\\" spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd, not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be just one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic scripture.  YHVH said to  my lord...:        Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish messiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king David.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,         \\\"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until        I put your enemies under your feet.\\\"  Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic descent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of course, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to make some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation.  But, there are problems.        In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the messiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the messiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king, bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's rule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the Christians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this psalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had also made.  One must remember that there were various factions among the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the messiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like his audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and who interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic. What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,         YHVH's utterance to my lord:  \\\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your        footstool.\\\"         YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule        in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer        themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the        holy mountains.           \\\"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek        forever.\\\"  The word \\\"lord\\\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian bibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the word is \\\"adoni,\\\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means \\\"lord,\\\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an address of respect.         There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is supposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the psalm translates to either \\\"a psalm of David,\\\" or \\\"a psalm about David.\\\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the psalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be talking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended from David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive tales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any praises of a messiah.      Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after David was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of favour for David's kingdom on hold.        The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was promised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies, successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king, enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.       We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone, though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though his use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this event is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off a little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note, though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd.  Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of an infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we might expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.  Moses & Jesus, Had it Together All Along...:         We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a pseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John deserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew.  But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah king, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this was accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the promise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.         [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,        rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.  It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but, Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian.  I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament which corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the course to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like his forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they still cling to it.  The Potter's Field:        We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by one of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,         [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver        in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief        priests, taking the silver, said, \\\"It isn't lawful for        us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood        money.\\\"  So they... bought a potter's field with it to        bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was        spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,         \\\"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price        of him on whom a price had been set by some of the        sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's        field, as the lord directed me.\\\"  This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament Scripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which Matthew makes use of.         [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,        thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \\\"Cast        them to the treasury,\\\" --the lordly price at which I        was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of        silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of        YHVH.  First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely a priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with one another.  The word, \\\"treasury,\\\" had been replaced by the King James Scholars with \\\"to the potter,\\\" precisely because this made Matthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed \\\"treasury,\\\" which also makes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas \\\"potter's field\\\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given Matthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty.       Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the text.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if as most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to toss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high priests.  The high priests would not put the money in the treasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the opposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student, the \\\"prophecy\\\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New Testament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing enough.  Wine, Vinegar, & Casting Lots:        Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.         [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,        mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not        drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they        divided his garments among them by casting lots: that        it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,         \\\"They parted my garments among them, and upon my        vesture did they cast lots.\\\"  First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour wine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find that right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him some to drink --not polluted with gall.         [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \\\"I thirst.\\\"  A bowl of        vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the        vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he        had received the vinegar, he said, \\\"It is finished;\\\"  But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the prophets, but one from the Psalms.         [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;        and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me        poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and        for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add        to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no        acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the        Book of the Living.  Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request of drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm quoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It is not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the \\\"Jesus\\\" in the psalm asks G'd for the damnation of the \\\"crucifiers,\\\" whereas the Jesus of the gospels says,         [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \\\"Father, forgive them, the        don't know what they do!\\\"  Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his meat, as the psalm stipulates.         With the \\\"prophecy\\\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally ask, \\\"What of the casting of lots?\\\"  This brings up the 22nd Psalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to say that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no great thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon in those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of Jesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions, his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some suspicions.  The 22nd Psalm:        This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of praise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We will examine the primary passages.         Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?!         Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words        of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you        don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.  Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross.  This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather than king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \\\"the lamb led mute before its shearers.\\\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much groaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross.         6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men...         All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag        their heads;  \\\"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let        him deliver him... for he delights in him.\\\"  This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.         12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their        mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.         16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of        evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and        feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my        garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.         19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my        soul from the sword, my life from the power of the        dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my        afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!  It would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately, this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \\\"have pierced\\\" really do not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,         16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of        evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my        hands and feet...  In Hebrew the phrase \\\"like the lion\\\" and a very rare verb form which can mean \\\"pierced\\\" differ by one phonetic character.  The word in the Hebrew text is literally, \\\"like the lion\\\" (ka'ari), which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that would urge a Christian to change the word to \\\"ka'aru.\\\"   But, to add the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \\\"prophecy\\\" this is just what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to Jesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators.         Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend itself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the psalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather the forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.        Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord Jesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian theology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful fundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might have been \\\"enhanced\\\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But, it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good things for St. Matthew.  The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's crucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after the fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,         [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his        side with a spear, and out came blood and water...        these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...        \\\"The will look on him whom they've pierced.\\\"  Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with them.         [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...        And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations        that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will        pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on        Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have        pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him        like you weep over a firstborn child.  John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that Matthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more than just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and blatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel writers, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded.    Reckoned with Transgressors:         After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming the Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of the gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.         [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,        one on his right, one on his left.  And so the        scripture was fulfilled which says,         \\\"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\\\"  Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53, about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the messiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its surrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The servant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the description of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the messiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between two thieves would fulfill the \\\"prophecy\\\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons.         Mark goes on to tell us how \\\"those who were crucified with [Jesus] also reviled him.\\\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a couple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke decides to change some things.  Luke tells us,         [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged        with him railed, \\\"Aren't you the messiah?! Save        yourself, and us!\\\"  This certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the people who crucified Jesus said, \\\"Save yourself!\\\" and that the robbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,         But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,        \\\"Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same        sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,        for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds.         But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,        \\\"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\\\"         And Jesus answered, \\\"Verily I say to you, today you        will be with me in paradise.\\\"  Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man, apparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have been a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by Luke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.   Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case, the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have seen.  The End of the World--        Mt. 24:         Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and his disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world which he has been warning about.         The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's        destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your        coming, and of the close of the age?         Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for        many will come in my name, saying, \\\"I am the christ.\\\"          ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for        this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,        nation will rise against nation... all this is but the        beginning of the birthpangs.              They will deliver you up... put you to death,        and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.        ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This        gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a        testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.              So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the        prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to        the mountains.               Immediately after the tribulation of those days,        the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from        heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man        in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,        and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out        his angels... and gather his elect...              Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its        branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know        that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these        things, you will know that He is near, at the very        gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not        pass away until all these things take place...              But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the        angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,        you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming        at an hour you do not expect.  From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells them that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it will come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error.  But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the End, and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be swept away.       There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \\\"this generation shall not pass away...\\\" really means \\\"this race of people will not pass away...\\\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples.  It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek, he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at least some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World.  The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from Rev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus meant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.         For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th chapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000 years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back, hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon.  Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how tired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for just the right moment to spring?          So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth, (Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or three days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three eternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine radiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best interests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway.  As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them, Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have seen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout Church history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple belief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away from question.  To question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely accepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time.  Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity have been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support wars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which Christianity can securely keep hold.\",\"Kent:       You say that                        ^^^^^^^^^                         Please don't!  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^       Name just three *really* competing Rosicrucian Orders.

THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                 Dorothy Denning                             Revised, April 21, 1993   INTRODUCTION  On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key.   CHIP CONTENTS  The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the \\\"MYK-78.\\\"  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about $30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the technology is shrunk to .8 micron.   ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.  The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the session key:     D[E[M; K]; K] = M .   CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW  All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at Mykotronx.  At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.    To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a 64-bit block R1:          R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .  Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:            R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]          R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .  R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies.  As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit key parts.    The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind.   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2, and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies.   The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or both may be independent from the government.   LAW ENFORCEMENT USE  When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder.   CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION  A successor to the Clipper Chip, called \\\"Capstone\\\" by the government and \\\"MYK-80\\\" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for delivery in June or July. \",\"    Just observed at the National Model United Nations here in NYC.

When someone claimed that guerillas were manifestations of popular sentiment, the topic arose:\\\"When does a civilian stop becoming a civilian?\\\".  If he houses and shelters guerillas of his own free will, aiding them, has he violated his \\\"civilian\\\" status?   But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways? If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Afterall, Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.   That is not exactly true.  The Hizbollah and their affiliated groups have made several attempts to infiltrate the border of Israel.   True, but the Syrians did allow (until at least 1984) guerillas to operate in the areas that were under their control, provided that those guerillas were attacking Israeli lines.  The problem is that Syria is also not as stable a partner for long term peace as others in the area might be. \",\" In 1860:  region              total population  free blacks  %       slaves   % U.S.                32,227,616        487,070      1.5%    3,953,818 12.3% Confederacy          9,103,332        132,760      1.5%    3,521,110 38.7% Union Slave States   3,212,041        128,158      4.0%      432,586 13.5% All Union States    23,124,284        354,310      1.5%      432,708  1.9% Union \\\"Free\\\" States 19,912,243        226,152      1.1%          122  0.0%  \",\"####   ####                          #     ###    #                         #   1   2     3 #      Facing           #                  # Female Plug End        #  4       5   6   #                         #               #                          #            #                          #  7     8  #                          #           #                          #############  Anyone Recognize this?

I've been seeing  her every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28)  and during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every  4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period.  As it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that  though I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she  mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13  weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had  an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no  problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain  in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very  difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or  move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for  when I do need to go out.)   Anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from  the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about  2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.   (I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating  very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well  now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile  related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my  upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I  was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because  it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt   no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I  ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had  turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if  I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it  wasn't as much of a problem.  So the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid  fatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware  of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have  been avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat  foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.    But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat  except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts,  fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I  should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only  have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day (  potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in  a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or  steamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have  some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if  I'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it  from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if  she's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her  recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on  cholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She  originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the  entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I  started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and  she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also  asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them  are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain,  and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did  want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be  temporary for that one week.   What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?

The SUNDAY TIMES 8 March 1992  Morgues fill as Azeris head for all-out war  -------------------------------------------  Thomas Goltz, the first to report the massacre by Armenian soldiers in  the worst violence since the breakup of the Soviet Union, reports from  Agdam  ------  Khojaly used to be a barren town, with empty shops and treeless dirt  roads. Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier  times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off  the map.  .......  As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of  Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt  that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been  the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke  apart.  .......  I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and  people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut Ezoya,  a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the  town, called her community \\\"sitting ducks, ready to get shot\\\". She and  her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.  .......  \\\"The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and  the government does nothing.\\\" Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,  said. \\\"Next they will drive us out or kill us all,\\\" said Dilbar, his  wife. The couple, their three sons and three daughters were killed in  the assault, as were many other people I had spoken to.  ......  \\\"It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have to cross.  There was a road, and the first units of the column ran across then  all hell broke loose. Bullets were raining down from all sides. we had  just entered their trap.\\\"  The azeri defenders picked off one by one. Survivors say that Armenian  forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything moved in  the gullies. A video taken by an azeri cameraman, wailing and crying  as he filmed body after body, showed a grizzly trail of death leading  towards higher, forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge  from the Armenians.  \\\"The Armenians just shot and shot and shot,\\\" said Omar Veyselov, lying  in hospital in Agdam with sharapnel wounds. \\\"I saw my wife and  daughter fall right by me.\\\"  People wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the  loved ones. Some vented their fury on foreigners: \\\" Where is my  daughter, where is my son ?\\\" wailed a mother. \\\"Raped. Butchered. Lost.\\\"  Azerbaijan has said as many as 1,000 refugees were killed as they  tried to flee. The Armenians have denied this, saying the civilians  were caught in \\\"crossfire\\\".  .......

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH  ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO  INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...  As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw  the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as  they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to  journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts  of the hills.  The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING  of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians  last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death  or missing...   Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter  as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there  was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer  ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We  swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon  under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.  We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round  again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a  valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung  round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired  repeated blasts.  Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting  had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in  fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.  I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,  its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on  \\\"our side\\\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a  search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.  Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two  M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed  flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second  crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains  and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters  were there to give covering fire if necessary.  The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet  armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani  official told us that there were now five former Soviet military  helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \\\"They have  signed contracts to fly for us,\\\" he said. The helicopter we engaged  in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian  pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.  We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an  heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer  white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four  corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an  Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies  on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back  towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before  the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.  Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the  civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were  covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor  mortis. They had been shot.  What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,  and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY  DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

Although not many patients with Hep B go on to chronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is something to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which also leads to cirrhosis.    Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function.  Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas, among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic circulation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis.  These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in men, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplant.  Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in your friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.

It would seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of gun control laws.         I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural and enforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and then that reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.          Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a crime with it a silly solution, it still doesn't address the question of Canada.  (Which is now, by the way, blaming their rising gun-crime rate on the U.S.  Strange that the border used to \\\"magically\\\" keep the guns out, but now isn't.)          The other side of the coin, of course, is that far \\\"illegal drugs\\\" are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally.  I've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals have shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources (stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simply see South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as well, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.           And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques of it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come to mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost entirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed for poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you compared the white majority they were virutally identical.          The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs. non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative conditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of nomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into account that the non-whites in either city were not living in the same conditions.          If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns, then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which are arguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far higher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly lower.           The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. \\\"inner-city\\\" problems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a condition which is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent crime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control is the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As one Canadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun control in 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase in violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparently they didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in the early eighties.          True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., where gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that crime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.         The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high or low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact violent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than it was going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by saying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be instituted to deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, you can't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of that gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control was implemented, just as happened in Canada.          As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent of gun control.          Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what others did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would sell to them?\",\"  export.lcs.mit.edu:/pub/sunkbd..930314.tar.Z   /MaF \",\"For Sale ---          U.S.Robotics 16.8k HST external modem, including power adapter,         Users Guide and Quick-Reference Card.          $515.00.

I say, no way I've already blown about 20 hours with this, about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$ to take a day off work.  Also, my 30 day return period is almost over and I've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So, the whole  thing is going back.     I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me that I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but also the two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately, I just spoke to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything up gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer.  I would really like to try Gateway again, I'm just very turned off by the prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support again...  I think their products are great for the most part, but I'm beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation. Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact?  I know Gateway is booming, and for good reason, but I don't know if I can take it again. Oh well, I feel better now... \",\"  I _know_ I shouldn't get involved, but...   :-)  [bit deleted]   Righto, DAN, try this one with your Cornflakes...  The book says that Muhammad was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a  modern day Mad Mahdi) or he was actually who he said he was. Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would  die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People  gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing  how his son-in-law made the sun stand still.  Call me a fool, but I believe  he did make the sun stand still.   Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn  to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example  anyone who is drawn to the Mad Mahdi is obviously a fool, logical people see  this right away. Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the  real thing.    --\",\"  Computer: 286-25 mhz Bus: ISA (12.5 mhz) Drive: Maxtor 7213A (213 mb)                                      config.sys / autoexec.bat                       MS DOS 5             no           WIN 3.1                      smartdrv.sys        cache         smartdrv.exe  CORE (V 2.7)         6950 k/sec          1390 k/sec     1395 k/sec Norton SI (V 5.0)     730 k/sec           980 k/sec      982 k/sec  I'd still like to here from people with VLB-IDE.

Thanks in advance. (Reply by post or email, whichever you prefer.)  --Nizam  --\",\" As one of the \\\"Clintonites\\\" cited above, I'll try to clarify since this is not a case of Clinton's \\\"dishonesty.\\\" (I won't necessarily defend him on other issues.)    There were NEVER any specific projects included in the Community Development Block Grant portion of the President's proposal.  Congressional Republicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what they felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL  projects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus package was ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the White House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted to Congress.  It didn't work.)  The $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close to covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it were passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and at what level.  In the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one ever expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the  Republicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS PACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total  amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus  package for ALL projects.    The plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are places where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing priorities.  If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects that will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton administration has been publicizing the issue.  A final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is worth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to them is new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally  supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending, arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending priorities than \\\"Washington bureaucrats.\\\"    Is it clear now?

Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something  I say can't be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \\\"scientific\\\"  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \\\"If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.\\\"    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \\\"There've got to be controlled studies\\\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying \\\"We don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.\\\"    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  \\\"Why should I prove your  theory?\\\"  and  \\\"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\\\"   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of  books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as I'm capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \\\"doctrinnaire\\\"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"In 12-step programs (like Alcoholics Anonymous), one of the steps involves acknowleding a \\\"higher power\\\".  AA and other 12-step abuse- recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.  Unfortunately, as evidence for God, this can be dismissed by stating that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes  people 'religious', and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but still maintain that both are escapism.  (And I suspect that there are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to Christianity.)  I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ- ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves as incomplete, and needing God (the 'God-shaped hole'), while atheists necessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  If the atheists are right, Christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly to stand up for themselves; if the Christians are right, the atheists are guilty of considerable arrogance.  (I use the term atheist to refer to a person who has a definite conviction that there is no God, as opposed to one who does not know and/or does not care about God.) == Seanna Watson   Bell-Northern Research,       | Pray that at the end of living, (seanna@bnr.ca) Ottawa, Ontario, Canada       | Of philosophies and creeds,                                               | God will find his people busy Opinion, what opinions?

The anecdotal experiences of individuals is ``superstition, not science,'' he said. ``I don't think glutamate has made them sick.''  And Dr. Robert Kenney of George Washington University conducted an double blind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to MSG also had similar reaction when they thought they had MSG but actually not.  Although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group, some of them might have been due to other causes. But because the anti MSG emotion runs so high, that some blame it for anything and everything.

He called them \\\"the Great Commission\\\" but this is NOT descriptive of Jesus's words in Matt. 10:15.  Matt. 10:14, Jerusalem Bible translation:   \\\"And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have  to say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust  from your feet.\\\"  Matt. 10:15:    \\\"I tell you solemnly, on the day of Judgment it will not    go as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with    that town.\\\"   \\\"> The above is a good description of Kaflowitz, who keeps harping on  > shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next.\\\"    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                ^^^^  The highlighted words refer to Matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively.  And Dean countered:  \\\"Actually, this comment of your's is a perfect example of what an intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are, since I specifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty to spread the word.  In fact, it is the combination of the two statements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to characterize that as \\\"ignoring\\\" the instruction to spread the word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.\\\"  Of course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of \\\"instruction to spread the word.\\\"  All these quotes btw are from:  Message-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>   And I claim it correctly, because my question went:  \\\"Do you, too, measure the goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?\\\"  and the closest Dean came to an answer was:  \\\"Peter, Peter, Peter.  You're just so stupid, pretentious, dull, and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that the sport is all there is.\\\"  Of course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts in GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this, yet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:  \\\"So I now restore the answer to your question that you deleted.

It really doesn't take much sophistication to understand.\\\"  On top of which, I doubt that the \\\"answer\\\" is at all representative of Dean's true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's  mind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken. One wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all this.  He even dredges up a falsified account of events that transpired earlier on another thread:  \\\"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the \\\"sins\\\" of other individuals.\\\" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  False.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins. That I made public announcements of the \\\"sins\\\" of others --\\\"sins\\\", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in the posts of others-- is a different matter.  Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so I pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread, YOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.  Dean again:  \\\"You made an ass of yourself by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was somehow an attempt to \\\"paint Jews as plaster saints,\\\" thereby revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well as showing your dislike for people saying positive things about Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then claiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.\\\"  Actually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite according to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing Jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as implicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.  I went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of the doubt in a post following my initial crack about \\\"plaster saints\\\",  suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.  In an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly distorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as the basis of one insult after another.\",\"   I'm not sure that's true.

The noise you hear is due to the momentary opening and closing of the path.  The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high impedance audio circuits a resistive \\\"T\\\" is constructed close to characteristic impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers the audio.  In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic impedance.  Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.  Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \\\"Make before break and Vica Versa\\\" but I haven't seen any of these for years.  Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.  A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \\\"optical isolator\\\".. It consists of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers passing the audio.  Once again this device in a \\\"T\\\" switches the audio.  Varying the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and you have a mixer!

The federal government has an interest in the intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of civil rights. It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting a lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically. It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid since over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group was getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being part of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the south stick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normally they wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were expeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to try it anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to somebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they did the school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and the president can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the militia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the thousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey or face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms! And by god, they did! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets! And the governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls that had brought the order to nationalize the guard.

I can't : see it having trouble keeping up.  His pcplus for dos works great,  re: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93  This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2 or DOS apps not running under Windows.  One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST) discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer than with the old 2400bps modem.   There are three reasons for the problem:  1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most    PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the    operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high    interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and    the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded    environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.  2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and    interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely    than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you    are losing data, you may be advised that \\\"you need to upgrade to a    16550\\\". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance    about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the    store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve    my own problem had never heard the term \\\"16550\\\" and many didn't even    know what a UART was.  3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade    your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience    errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers    don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this    regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications    like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem    by themselves.  If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one. Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.   The Hardware Situation.  The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250 or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft diagnostic program \\\\WINDOWS\\\\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before* bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.  The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to 460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info, see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.  So, what UART component do you have?  Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with the numbers \\\"8250\\\" or \\\"16450\\\", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI, and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket COM board.  If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The \\\"N\\\" chip is the normal 40-pin dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550 chips without the \\\"A\\\" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).  Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips: National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552 Chips&Technology:       82C607 Texas Instruments:      t16c550a Silicon Systems:        73M550 VLSI                    16C550 TurboCom warns about the pre-\\\"A\\\" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550, says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70 systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).  If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after- market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).  Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology MCT-AIO+ card from:  JDR Microdevices 2233 Samaritan Drive San Jose  CA  95124 (800) 538-5000 voice US (408) 559-1200 voice other (800) 538-5005 FAX US  The MCT-AIO+ (and the \\\"+\\\" is important) sells for $89.95.

Meanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports, and am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based 8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set the internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.   The Software Situation  Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun problems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the 16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1 drivers have the following limitations:  - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.  - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt    rate of 10x during uploads.  - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2    more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).  - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.    With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1    or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would    be effective.  - The API won't accept rates above \\\"CBR_128000\\\".  - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even    if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit    from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.  - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.  - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.  - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port    speed options above 19200 bps.  These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0). Rumors suggest they \\\"may\\\" be solved in Windows \\\"4.0\\\".  You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of \\\"TurboCom\\\", current version 1.2, from:  Bio-Engineering Research Pacific CommWare Division 180 Beacon Hill Lane Ashland  OR   97520-9701 (503) 482-2744 voice (503) 482-2627 FAX (503) 482-2633 BBS MCImail:    344-5374 CompuServe: 71521,760  Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit cards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom but as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company per se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a market for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.  I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my datacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps when linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O. Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts are still using antique UARTs and drivers.  Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the Windows APIs and dialog boxes.  I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC) standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another 16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above 115,200 may still be risky.  Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a 16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of \\\"Windows Sources\\\" magazine. I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a \\\"power user\\\" whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems.   Closing Soapbox Comments  The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface, the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the exception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent I/O.  You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this situation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs \\\"sort of\\\" work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a hardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that use that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.

The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of  the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi  to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]    The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain  etymology. It may originally have meant \\\"member of the tribe,\\\" as in the Avestan compound mogu-tbish (\\\"hostile to a member of the tribe\\\"). This meaning would have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \\\"member of the priestly tribe\\\" and perhaps to \\\"priest\\\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is probably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \\\"Magoi\\\" as one of the six tribes of the Medes.   For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were responsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their knowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the Great (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political and civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period (Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by Darius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.   The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.   There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the Avestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \\\"gift\\\"), is not without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found, in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of purity, or separation of the \\\"mixture\\\" of the two opposed principles of spirit and matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \\\"chorus,\\\" from the root mangh, which is said to mean \\\"sing the magic song\\\" (Nyberg, 1966) and has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the Avestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite a recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore the Avestan term for \\\"priest,\\\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is  perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis  (Gershevitch, 1964).   The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in particular derives from an older form, magupati (\\\"head of the Magi\\\"). During the Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of a hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\\\"the high priest of high priests\\\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.   The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl., khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it. The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons of putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the Parsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this rite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was in vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with wax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples of Central Asia.   The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a ritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also known for the practice of killing harmful, or \\\"Ahrimanical,\\\" animals (khrafstra) such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants, tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of felt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their breath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition that is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was that of the priesthood: white.   In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this they were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible for teaching the prince the \\\"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\\\" and thus the \\\"cult of the gods.\\\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and master of himself.   During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of Gaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself Smerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation - the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media, in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.   No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were renowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of the greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in Bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were also known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism; this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek, like \\\"goes,\\\" \\\"expert in the magic arts\\\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.   To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called western Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must have been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.   The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical historians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism, belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology and eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted Zoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and placed themselves under his venerable name.   Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the Zoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \\\"the law-abjuring daivas\\\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and practices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the supreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.; Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it has been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own priesthood, would be very strange.   The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the first millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to us especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles of the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\\\"beneficent spirit\\\") and Angra Mainyu (\\\"hostile spirit\\\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans- formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro- astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the Mesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known to the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which we give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]   Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises on the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have survived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of wisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an abundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).   Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]   The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the religious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce, 1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of Iran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to establish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures in the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar and Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.\",\"I am looking for information on possible causes and long term effects of bone marrow sclerosis.

What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith (i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal revelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God  must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would  honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone  who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are  rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient  for them, or because they wish to spurn God.  I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one  holds are universal and absolute.

Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)  Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my pocket on two 8mm tapes.  Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At some point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that \\\"can't\\\" is a prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.  With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for every person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you need the \\\"master key\\\" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information that have to be stored an awful lot of places.  Come to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial political views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial secrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left unexplained by those that point out this threat.)   Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened many times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some fraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.  Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on the escrow databases.  We crypto types are all taught something very important at the beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the easily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a secret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million Clipper chips.  I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this doesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too many of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect that they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can try to delay things as long as possible.  Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable bureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe that this scheme might give people some security, even as their subordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of it all.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\"So long as we think that good things are what we *have* to do rather than what we come to *want* to do, we miss the point.

Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille's translations (in his book, \\\"The Bible, the Qur'an and Science\\\") for in general his translations are more literal.   Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as   \\\"...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion.\\\"  (Also note that \\\"the celestial bodies\\\" in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator's interpolation -- it is not existent in the original Arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.)    You're right, what the verses _do_ contain isn't all that remarkable.  However, Dr. Bucaille (a surgeon, that's how he's a \\\"Dr.\\\") thinks it is significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas, even though geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century (?) or so.

Unfortunately, too often the prize is limited and the efficacy of the 'cure' questionable when applied to all sufferers.  This applies to both medical researchers and non-medical individuals. Just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use does not make the next cure-all. What about the dozens of individuals who have courageously participated in clinical trials? Did they have any guarentee of cures? Are they any less because they didn't trumpet their story all over the world?  As a parting note, wasn't there some studies done on Gingko seeds for Meniere's?

It would seem more logical to say that since  the heterosexual group of men is larger then the chances of promiscuity  larger as well.  In my opinion, orientation has nothing to do with it.  Men are men and they all like sex.  I am a gay male.  I have had sex three  times in my life, all with the same man.  Before that, I was a virgin.  So... whose promiscuous?  Just because someone is gay doesn't mean they have no morals.  Just because  someone is heterosexual doesn't mean they do.  Look at the world....

What else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial number?    To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is    first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.    S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a    64-bit block R1:      R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .     Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and    N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]      R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .     R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The    first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The    rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2    are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow    agencies. \",\"Jason Kratz writing:  ...

Arkansas - HB 1447, Firearms Preemption Legislation was signed by the Governor making this the forty-first state to pass preemption. Preemption had passed twice in previous sessions only to be vetoed by then Gov. Bill Clinton.  HB 1417, mandatory storage of firearms, amended and then killed in committee.   Colorado - SB 42, mandating the storage of firearms with a trigger-lock, killed in committee.  SB 104,  prohibiting the sale of certain semi-auto firearms was killed in committee.

Wisconsin - In a referendum up against all odds, the determined efforts of the Madison Area Citizens Against Crime paid off on April 6 when a nonbinding referendum banning the possession of handguns in Madison, Wisconsin, was defeated.  Despite opposition to the ban -- aired largely by firearms owners at a series of public meetings on the issue -- the Common Council voted on February 17 to place the referendum on the ballot, allowing only seven weeks of campaigning to reverse public opinion on the controversial issue.   An October 1992 poll conducted by the Wisconsin State Journal found 57% in support and 38% opposed, with 5% expressing no opinion.  By election day, of the more than 56,000 voters who went to the polls, 51% cast ballots in opposition to the proposal while 49% voted to have the Madison Common Council enact such a ban.  The campaign committee, spearheaded by the Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement and NRA-ILA, relied on neighborhood canvassing, direct mail and radio/TV advertising to educate voters on the civil liberties implications raised by enforcement of the ban if the referendum was approved.   Despite the surprising defeat, it is expected that the Madison initiative's chief proponent, Mayor Paul Soglin, will attempt to have the Common Council enact an ordinance banning handguns.

But so,  unfortunately have other nations.\",\"First, I thank collectively all people who have given good answers to my questions. In my follow-up to Jason Smith's posting, I will address some issues that have caused misunderstanding:     Yes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not escape your notice.   The correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence, but not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense.  However, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test, including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc. It does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere 'best fits' for the data.     Well, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science requires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if the theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason. Disbelievers are not punished.    This is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_? My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is unable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God.   Yes, I know that one can't believe without God's help; Luther makes this quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I'm afraid this does not change my situation.      (deletions)    No, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy, either something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody would ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but actually no existing being could give an answer.   Imagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also ask: \\\"Why nothing exists?\\\" This is equivalent to my counter-question, \\\"why nothing exists in nothingness\\\".   Now, \\\"why anything exists\\\" is equivalent to \\\"why something exists in somethingness\\\".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post.   I do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence, in general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still leave open the question \\\"why this, and not that\\\", and this is where theistic explanations come in.  Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being's existence.   This is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not? Also, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has no meaning in His case.   If I am for a reason, I've yet failed to see what it would be.  From our perspective, it looks like 'I' exist for truly random reasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can I believe there is any better reason for my existence?   Yes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better. My 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I have to admit, but I am patient.    No, it doesn't, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists, for an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.   It is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question  \\\"why do I exist, in particular\\\" is _not_ an invalid question - this is not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to tell, and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of another, especially since I found I was deluding myself.    I think \\\"pre-existence\\\" is an oxymoron. There is no time 'outside' of this spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that  perspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who are inside it.    No. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think philosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not knowable?   This is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous other questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base my faith on.

Just before arriving at a toll booth I switch the hazards on.  I do thisto warn other motorists that I will be taking longer than the 2 1/2 seconds to make the transaction. Taking gloves off, getting money out of coin changer/pocket, making transaction, putting gloves back on takes a little more time than the average cager takes to make the same transaction of paying the toll.

In this group, since you are posting from a american college site, I'm willing to take it as given that you have a pair of blue jeans.

At the risk of offending everybody, I will interject the 13th century point of view.  Christ descended immediately into the bosom of Abraham to set captives captive.  He preached to the saved for three days before drawing them with Him back to this earth.  I'm no expert on this part, but Matthew (27:52-53) says about the death of Jesus: \\\"tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised.  And coming forth from the tombs after his resurrection, they entered the holy city and appeared to many.\\\"  (NAB)  Regarding the hell of the damned, of which you speak, Christ did not see it (Ps 16:10, Acts 2:27), although it saw Him (cf. Is 45:2).    Concerning the abodes of the dead, I don't want to subject my brethren to further anguish, so I will direct you to contact me through e-mail if you are genuinely concerned.

Could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of  Israel right after it was formed.     No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity. Palestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard about anti-trust in the business world.  Since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says that, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of investing, you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly, the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate. They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.  The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic / multi-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours was no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair market value, etc... They did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist myself, but this one is hard to dismiss).     Again Adam, the devil is in the details. I don't want to get on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its OK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 is a nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it has an integer square root.    Do you actually believe this?

I beleive that Israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews). Israel probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic cleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the international community, or make the best out of a no win condition: show the world how good Israel is towards the 'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the arab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So yes, they're there. But as a community with history and roots, its dead.

Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something like DES) for the encryption.  How could the \\\"back door\\\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers used in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.  Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most straightforward to me.)  Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the message itself has a \\\"dual key\\\" property, that possession of either of two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from the DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.  It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early knowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with Clipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.\",\"FM-2 has been sold.

In practice?  The technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as I understand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.  Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule today.  But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain cellular calls and then ask a judge, \\\"Hey, can we have permission to listen to those tapes?\\\" can they?   Yes, that is a major concern, but I think that they think they can win just by having 99.5% of the USA use this system.  They don't even have to care about the cautious .5% that's left.

Larry   Larry McElhiney 1385 7th Avenue #10 Santa Cruz, CA 95062\",\"I'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of \\\"arrogance of Christians\\\" and look forward to any responses.  In my encounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth.  According to them, their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of God and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way. Their way is the 'truth.'  But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason, but it seems to me a choice.  My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when I was in grade school:  A kid would say, \\\"All policemen are jerks!\\\"  I'd ask, \\\"How do you know?\\\"  \\\"Because my daddy told me so!\\\"  \\\"How do you know you're daddy is right?\\\"  \\\"He says he's always right!\\\"  Well the argument usually stops right there.  In the end, aren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as false?  -------------  This is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I apologize if I'm covering tired old ground.  Some of the discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome any comments.  --   [I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  I can understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough evidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for other religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of intelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that doesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who believe Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict it are false.  This suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than the Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where people choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent spiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in some unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of one sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But Christianity is in its essense a \\\"historical\\\" religion.  That is, it's based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out there, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways, and that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \\\"mundane\\\" world, we are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it falls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The Christian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual external reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know everything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that implies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't see how else we could proceed.  This needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking with people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and even if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.\",\"Just as the title suggest, is it okay to do that? I havne't got DOS6 yet, but I heart DoubleSpace is less tight than stacker 3.0.

I am familiar with    the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally    I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use.    If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do    fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is    a long and painful experience.   What I hate about GUI's:   - Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess    I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a    computer with one hand and use the other for holding something    like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my    favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be    done with one hand such as navigating, cutting, pasting,    searching, opening and saving files, etc. The main thing I    need to use both hands for is entering text.

I've tried a couple without much luck.  Please E-mail responses and I will post a summary of any replies.  Thank you.\",\"   I think that you are changing the meaning of \\\"values\\\" here. Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.  value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in  usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus.  The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound.   In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing.  In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the word \\\"value\\\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as \\\"objective values.\\\"  Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow. Just because the word \\\"values\\\" is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts.  If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  So, back to the original question:  And objective morality is.....?  If you can provide an objective foundation for \\\"morality\\\" then that will be a good beginning. \",\": >Is there an ftp site where I can get the MS speaker sound driver?

I originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone here will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but are missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.  *** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it *** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a *** different version.  The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They are fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes, anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a \\\"virtual screen\\\", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included a simple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256 color GIF image into a buffer.

The Apple tape drive is quite slow, so the advantages of Retrospect relative to the simpler MacTools Backup are less significant than  might be the case for someone backing up a large server to a DAT drive.    Used Apple tape drives are going for ~$100, so it might make less economic sense to pay an extra ~$140 for Retrospect when MacTools  is cheaper and includes other worthwhile utilities.

Maybe they're just UNLUCKY.  If a rapist pulls a woman into an alley in Boston, chances are almost certain that she won't be counted  as one of those self-defenders because our local constabulary didn't consider it important that she be allowed to arm herself.  Even though the shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the \\\"gun owner\\\" column.   Ironic words for somebody who lives in Florida.  The \\\"average threat level\\\" in Florida has been REDUCED by a liberal CCW policy.  It's well known that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because  they are less likely to be carrying than your natives.  Come on up to Boston, or NYC, or Washington DC, and see how much diddlysquat the  \\\"average threat level in the country\\\" means to a resident there.   Sometimes this works.  Sometimes it just lands your good neighbors  on the dance card for the next wave of drive-bys.  Someone here once told a story about LA gangs moving into Phoenix.  I've misplaced the original text, but the story started with one resident calling the  cops on a gang member.  Sure enough, a few nights later, there was a  drive-by performed at the resident's house.  Except that this time, unlike in LA, the entire street came out and returned fire, putting an end to the car's occupants.  The gang packed up and left.  Of course, in LA, or in a place like Florida after the hurricane, your first problem is to FIND an officer to step up to and tell anything.   Look, nobody is arguing this.  I have a fire extinguisher at home.   That doesn't mean I can be careless about tossing my burnt matches  on the carpet.  I live carefully, monitor the woodstove, get my flue cleaned twice a year, and test my smoke alarms annually.  But if -- DESPITE all this -- a fire does start, it's too late for any of these things EXCEPT the extinguisher.   You seem to be agreeing with your opponent.  You can't trust your government to protect you from abusers and violators -- white-collar, blue-collar, epauletted, or tank-shirted.  Ultimately, no one has the power to enforce your \\\"rights\\\" but you.  Unless you've given up that  power.   Too many people fit that category, that is true.  Some of us like to believe that they are uninterested in the facts behind the case for gun  ownership because they've been conditioned to believe that there AREN'T  any.  You seem content to underestimate the electorate; I'm willing to try to raise their consciousness.   I think we can.  HCI was founded in what, 1980?  In the mid-80's, they ran a \\\"One  Million Strong!\\\" campaign for two years before reaching this goal.   My understanding is that they \\\"reached\\\" it by the stratagem of including wide classes of people other than dues-paying members.  (I can't speak authoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they started running a \\\"Two Million Strong!\\\" campaign for a while -- but they let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they simply were never going to reach that level of membership.  In 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting point of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.   By 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had  about a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it the third largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA). And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historical figures from Kukla's \\\"Gun Control,\\\" pp. 61 and 420.)  As you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused by their T-bones and MTV.  That leaves hard-core gun-owners against  hard-core gun banners.  I know a number of ex-HCI members who have recently become NRA members. I've never heard of a single one who has gone the other way.  Yes, I think we can and will win this one.   I think they would be used far less to hammer nails, as well, but, like you, I can't give any citation showing that this utilization is CURRENTLY significant at more than an anecdotal level.  If you can,  I'm waiting. -- \",\"I have been experiencing several end-user problems with various commercial software packages (WordPerfect 5.2/WIN, Publish It!/WIN 3.1) and printing landscape mode on a Citizen PN48 (the little guy) or the Citizen GSX-140+.  In a nutshell the problem is that I lose the first 0.625 inches of information from my left margin, be it white space or TrueType font output, and margins are not preserved on subsequent pages past the first.  WordPerfect had a workaround consisting of using the \\\"Default\\\" location for the printers instead of \\\"Tractor\\\" or \\\"Manual\\\".  They have also filed this as a bug and are continuing to investigate it.  MS Write, of course, has no problem with these printer drivers, proving that Microsoft knows something the rest of us don't!

Publish It!/WIN is still investigating this problem, and while I was consider- my options (rejecting the one about buying an $800 DTP package, for *surely* they wouldn't have this problem, right?) I stumbled onto a global workaround.

If we  unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity,  we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we  encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with  Christianity and reject what isn't.      We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine  the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch  and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.   Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our  lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and  service.  The command to love God with all one's mind means no fuzzy- headed drifting from idea to idea.    One Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope.  It is a frequent theme  in his writings.  Indeed, thoughtful Christians from most traditions  recognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of Christians.  It  too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith.

(BTW, that was why the chemical engineer arrested in the WTC explosion thrust his hands into a toilet filled with urine as the cops were breaking down the door -- the nitrogen in the urine would mask any residue from explosives.  I found it interesting the news reported his acts, but not his reasons).  Somewhere, perhaps a privacy group, they discussed the legal ramifications of using a password like    I shot Jimmy Hoffa and his body is in a storage locker in Camden  a while back.  The impression I got was that real judges would dismiss arguments that this password is self-incrimination as first-year law school sophistry -- the fact that you use a statement for a password has no bearing on the veracity of that phrase.  You are not being asked to incrimidate yourself (e.g., \\\"where did you bury the body?\\\"); you are being asked to provide information necessary to execute a legal search warrant.  Refusing to provide the password is akin to refusing to provide a key to a storage locker... except that they could always _force_ their way into the locker.

Following up on software availability of NAPLPS supporting software I find that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being PP3 which runs soley on MSDOS machines leaving Mac and Amiga users to buy full commercial software if they want to try out the BBS (I know I wouldn't)  Next most interesting possibility is to port MGR to PC, Mac, Amiga.

Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it (as long as my advisor doesn't catch me - which is easy enough to do), but  stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review  committees and the peer review process in general.  In today's world that's  what determines what science is: what gets funded.  And a damn good thing to. Flights of fantasy just don't have much chance of producing anything, at  least not in biomedical research.

What our  dear  founders  did was formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop- olistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth- er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly debatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de- bate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made, however, is that people played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smythe and his pals showed up.   What's wrong with best defenceman, period?  Was there  ever  a  better defenceman?   Was  there  ever a better player?

However, if a professional thief wants your vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:  1) ignition kill or fuel cut-off 2) a flashing red LED  These two are basic to a decent alarm system.   To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock.

However, = is it a meaningful question, after all? = = I would say it isn't. Consider the following:  Apparently it *is* for many persons.  Hence, we *have* religions.  = The question \\\"why anything exists\\\" can be countered by = demanding answer to a question \\\"why there is nothing in nothingness, = or in non-existence\\\".  Actually, both questions turn out to be = devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist = don't exist. Tautology at its best.  Carefully examine the original question, and then the \\\"counter-question\\\".  The first asks \\\"Why\\\", while the second is a request for definition.  It  doesn't address why something does or does not exist, but asks to define  the lack of existence.  The second question is unanswerable indeed, for how do we identify something as \\\"nothing\\\" (aren't they mutually exclusive terms)?.  How do we identify a state of non-existence (again, this is nearing the limits of this simple layman's ability to comprehend, and I would appreciate an explanation).   I might add, the worldview of \\\"Things that exist do, and things that don't...don't\\\" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable, as does the theist's belief in God.  It is based on the assumption that there is *not* a reason for being, something as ultimately (un)supportable as the position of there being a reason.  Its very foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there *is* a reason.  We come to this. Either \\\"I am, therefore I am.\\\", or \\\"I am for a reason.\\\" If the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are satisfied, and need not a doctor.  If the latter, your search is just beginning.    = I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.  Time will tell. 8^)  =  = Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is = Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this = answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is = actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and = them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.  Agreed.  It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as well.  = Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence. = This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God = Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence, = it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always = existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.  This does not preclude His existence.  It only seeks to identify His *qualities* (implying He exists to *have* qualities, BTW).  = The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable = of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not = accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.  Like the theist, we come to a statement of faith, for this position assumes  that the evidence at hand is conclusive.  Note, I am not arguing against  scientific endeavor, for science is useful for understanding the universe in which we exist. But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective.  I seek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the Creator.  I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer \\\"why\\\".   It appears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting that 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an answer.    = : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \\\"why\\\".  That isn't = : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural). =  = This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \\\"how\\\", = not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \\\"why\\\" = questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the = supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is = as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.  My apologies.  I was using why as \\\"why did this come to be\\\".  Why did pre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.  But we come to the admission that science fails to answer \\\"Why?\\\".  Because it can't be answered in the realm of modern science, does that make the question invalid? = : I don't believe *any* = : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite = : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion. =  = This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are = somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians = in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce = they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?  I suppose we would do the same thing as when Galileo or Capernicus was  *vindicated*  (before someone starts jumping up and down screaming \\\"Inquisition!\\\", note I said *vindicated*.  I certainly hope we've gotten beyond the \\\"shooting the messenger\\\" stage).  M. Pihko does present a good point though.  We may need to ask \\\"What do I  as an individual Christian base my faith on?\\\"  Will it be shaken by the production of evidence that shatters our \\\"sacred cows\\\" or will we seek to understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God *said* (and continues to say) in his Word?  \\\"Why do I ask why?\\\" (apologies to Budweiser and company 8^]).  Jason.   \",\"      There are some issues which come to mind when one considers the law enforcement aspects of the use of the Big Brother (Clipper) chip.      The drug dealers and terrorists aren't going to let themselves be caught by using this type of encryption.  In 1985 the New York Times reported that government investigators broke up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to eavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest them.      A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said \\\"There are a lot of medium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the signals intelligence operation of this group.\\\"      For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure communications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip will only increase their numbers.      Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the use of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional and civil liberties questions involved.      For example, in some areas of the world torture is used as an investigative tool by the local \\\"law-enforcement\\\" people.  I suspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and shortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep the conviction rate high.      The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country (even with a court order obtained by showing \\\"probable cause\\\") is because we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and what is ethically and morally right.      I think that the same question of expediency versus morality should come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  I vote for morality.      I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat to prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is not put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the White House press release I came away with that impression.      To most of the American public, the word \\\"hacker\\\" has rightly or wrongly come to mean \\\"high tech adolescent vandal\\\". It has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt regarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who have genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues surrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother does not become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.  I would hate to see this become some kind of high tech Volstead Act.      The high speed digital communications revolution is coming at us with the speed of an SST.  The times they are a changing, and just as IBM is learning that they can't do business the same way they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe NSA should evaluate another approach.      EFF, who have correctly questioned the cryptographic strength of Big Brother, may need to send a stronger message out regarding the constitutional issues involved.      Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more.      And as for Dorothy Elizabeth Robling Denning: En quoi cela vous concerne, cheri? \",\"Yo, did anybody see this run of HARD COPY?  I guy on a 600 Katana got pulled over by the Police (I guess for speeding or something).  But just as the cop was about to step out of the car, the dude punches it down an interstate in Georgia. Ang then, the cop gives chase.  Now this was an interesting episode because it was all videotaped!!! Everything from the dramatic takeoff and 135mph chase to the sidestreet battle at about 100mph.  What happened at the end?  The guy (who is being relentless chased down box the cage with the disco lights) slows a couple of times to taunt the cop.   After blowing a few stop signs and making car jump to the side, he goes up a dead end street.  The Kat, although not the latest machine, is still a high performance machine and he slams on the brakes.  Of couse, we all know that cages, especially the ones with the disco lights, can't stop as fast as our high performance machines.  So what happens?...  The cage plows into the Kat.  Luckily for this dude, he was wearing a helmet and was not hurt.  But dude, how crazy can you get!?!  Yeah, we've all went out and played cat and mouse with our friends but, with a cop!!???!!!  How crazy can you get!?!?!  It took just one look at a ZX-7 who tried this crap to convince me not to try any shit like that.  (Although the dude collided with a car head on at 140 mph, the Kawasaki team colors still looked good!!!  Just a few scratches, like no front end.... 3 inch long engine and other \\\"minor\\\" scratches...)  If you guys are out there, please, slow it down.  I not being an advocate for the cages (especially the ones that make that  annoying ass noises...), but just think...  The next time you punched it (whether you have an all mighty ZX-11 or a \\\"I can do it\\\" 250 Ninja), just remember, a kid could step out at any    time.  Peace & ride (kinda) safe.

As far as collectivity/speculation is concerned they think it is a  waste of time, especially the later rubber bumpered models are the least desirable, a 1962 original model the most. The reasons for its low value are easy availability and the fact that it just was not a very good car.\",\"Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral, other than Leviticus? So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from Leviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be ignored by Christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).  Later, Max (Bob) Muir  [The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly cited passages are:  the story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and there's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate position on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the Bible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been known specifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a cesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes, homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action described.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about as many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of guests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically about homosexuality.  In the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom 1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil. Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about idolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at least result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this passage.  It does not use the word \\\"homosexuality\\\", and it is referring to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality. So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality. But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway, that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards  homosexuality.  The other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim 1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used here mean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning, such as \\\"wanton\\\", and that another may be specifically \\\"male prostitute\\\".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching about homosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul shared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.  Jude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  The context in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in Sodom were angels, it seems likely that \\\"strange flesh\\\" refers to intercourse with angels.  As you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion is determined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that the passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OT prohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT endorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and no clear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in Rom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly do the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is legitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his background and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.  This is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long dissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it's clear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down to is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This appears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as a whole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today. This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference between Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both sides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the other side will finally come to their senses.  That makes things very frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic outcome is not very likely...\",\"hi folks i have 2 hd first is an seagate 130mb the second a cdc 340mb (with a future domain no ram) i'd like to change my 2 controller ide & scsi and buy a new one with ram (at least 1mb) that could controll  all of them any companies? how many $? and is it possible via hw or via sw select how divide the ram cache for 2 hd?

So in sum and to beat a dead horse:  (1) When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of absorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength, the cone outputs are _indistinguishable_.  (2) Cones are simply detectors with different spectral sensitivities and are not any more \\\"color sensitive\\\" than are rods, ommatidia or other photoreceptors.  (3) Color vision arises because outputs of receptors which sample different parts of the spectrum (cones in this case) are \\\"processed centrally\\\".  (The handwave is intentional)   I've worked and published research on rods and cones for over 10 years so the adherence to the belief that cones can \\\"detect color\\\" is frustrating.

They are not able to use NuBus.  : Ah, but why?  Can some technically-hip Macslinger tell us what the : difference is between PDS and Nubus?    : Is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into PDS and ends in a : Nubus card cage?  At least, Marvin's friend has not been able to : locate one and neither have I.  What is the fundamental reason for : this?  I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages (I'm sure I've seen them advertised occassionally), but I think that the main problem is that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother.  (Of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive...)  NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there is no problem building an expansion box.  The difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work together on the same computer. PDS (processor direct slot) is just that: here are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with this and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. You may be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2 video cards in, and just watch them conflict! Of course, the extra  electronics in a NuBus slot makes it appreciably more expensive, so guess why Apple doesn't put it in it's cheaper machines?

Should we name a division or trophy after him?  Smythe and Norris and the bunch were honoured purely because they were powerful owners.  As owners they certainly did help to build the league but whether they developed the game is another question altogether. Are we going to honour those who contributed to the league's evolution or are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the  sport itself?      I can't disagree with you here.    What have you heard?  The Major was the *definitive* little asshole!  He originated the phrase \\\"if you can't beat 'em in the alley you can't beat 'em on the ice.\\\"  That was his idea of hockey.  Do you think, by chance, that Don Cherry is a classy individual?   The money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on, and that is: \\\"it is the players that are what make the game great and not the people who put them on the ice\\\"  Exactly true.  Naming divisions and trophies after Smythe and the bunch is the same kind of nepotism that put Stein in the hall of fame.  I have always thought that this was nonsense.   -- \",\"Hi!

If you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine.  The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle (even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of the law is no excuse - they will get you too!  It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors.  Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \\\"no way!\\\"  But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one, and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.  Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.  For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave enlightment may be necessary.  So, the questions are -   What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?   Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by   a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector   antenna?   Are any brands \\\"quieter\\\" than others?\",\":  : I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it, : and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part : in the much larger political agenda of President Clinton.

Schimmel\",\"I'm not very impressed by the old so-called \\\"prospecting\\\" work from LPI, it has almost all been geared towards industrially silly processes on the moon as an excuse to put astronauts there.   [...]  Translation:  It doesn't support the Nick Szabo Vision of the Future to Which You MUST Subscribe...  Fred, we're all supporting what each of us thinks should be done, to some degree.  If you have a problem with what Nick thinks should be done, address it, instead of just complaining about his doing so.  You really don't get what the 'complaints' are about, do you?   [not incredibly clear explanation of complaints...something between    feelings regarding Nick's method, and judgments about his meaning]  T  F  *** Fred's issue #1;  Nick's alleged trashing of others ***  I only got it when you stopped trashing, and made your point patently, instead of 'allegorically'.  That was my point all along, Fred.      I see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last point.  Why don't you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective point-of-view?  And, as usual, you defend your insults with \\\"he started it.\\\"  \\\"Yeah, I took some of his research and called it my own, but he started it.\\\"  \\\"So what if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first.\\\"  Besides that, I think it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it. So your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.  Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  \\\"I never borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you gave it to me.\\\"  Make up yer mind, Fred!      First, I try to address what I think you meant, for which I am rewarded with a denial of sorts, and a smart remark.  Then, I point out that I am not clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly interpreting you a second time, and I'm stupid for it.  I just can't win, can I, Fred?  You've got a great point here somewhere, it's just that between stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.   *** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning ***  Too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or you would have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had.  My reading of what Nick actually said is that \\\"people aren't required in all parts of all space processes\\\", so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program, I read as \\\"People are required in all parts of all space processes.\\\"  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'm so patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat your terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)  The point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'd only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's your job, Fred.  And, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points, simultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan' that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone.   No, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts made you imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even though it's no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone as dense as myself.      Of course, Socrates.  How could it be otherwise?   Who cares who came on the net first?  If you do, consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years. If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I went down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It's just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's no worse than your own.  Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical, while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling isn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might see it better, Fred.  \\\"Net.ghod wannabe\\\"?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted my motivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as your insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to impress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a jerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands. Alas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried to communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.  Well, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I'll never be able to get a(nother) job with NASA, since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall.  Well, I just hope you're happy.  Please leave me alone, now.  I just don't have the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me.  Maybe Nick or Pat can approach your high standards, but I'm dropping it now.  -Tommy Mac ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk   \\\\\\\\ As the radius of vision increases, 18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm \\\\\\\\ the circumference of mystery grows.\",\"  You are conveniently ommitting the fact that the Arab governments told the Arab citizens of Israel to leave Israel, join with the Arab armies so that after what they felt like an assured victory occured, these Arabs could return to their former homes, reclaim them as well as anything else they wanted that belonged to Jews.  When the Arabs lost, Israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as citizens.  What would you have done?  Let them in so they could kill Jews?  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens  because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave.  Of course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is impossible.  Therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the country.   No kibbutz that I have ever visited has any \\\"employees\\\" unless they had to hire some people for the restaurants, hotels etc if there weren't enough  people ON the kibbutz to do them.  In such cases, they are paid properly. If a kibbutz turns away an Arab, 9I have never seen or heard of this) but it reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz, not the whole kibbutz movement.   This just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli politics.  Although the  major parties in Israel aren't religious (however not totally secular), due to the format of the government (coalition) the religious parties have always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition. In fact, from what I heard the present government is the least influenced by the religious parties in the existance of Israel.  Israel CANNOT be called a secular state.  For instace, Haifa is the only city in the country (except for maybe some Arab cities) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath.   There are many other examples of religion in Israel.  Marriages in Israel are NOT contolled by the state, but by Rabbis and Priests.  Obviously your  disbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country you claim to know so much about.

I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published  solutions to it.   The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw  the object we   1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively  computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume  that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not  exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable  measure. 2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment  of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two  triangles which will be filled in to color the surface. 3) Depth sort the triangles 4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw  and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is  along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge  colored with a special \\\"edge color\\\"   It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface. The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated. They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area.\",\"------------------------------------------------------------------------- One reason that the WHA abandoned the blue puck was the fact that it crumbled very quickly during play.

Personally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays, or at least been among the leaders.   Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just one base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.   Wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed. The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays. Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years.   Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances. The Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls in the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great on defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first.   Wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on defense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers some runs.  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average. I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw seem to have come out of theirs.\",\"      You know, I never really appreciated them before!  \",\"jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu:     Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.  It would not    be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be    local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill    AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.    High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but    the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun    - and would pay through the nose for it.  Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude, homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of killing German soldiers for their guns.  Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible. The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel tubing, hand tools and a welder.  I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown locally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I think the demand for \\\"real\\\" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have firearms, and \\\"bad guys\\\" will continue to have access to them, one way or another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation.\",\"I received the following two notes from Martin Hellman with details on how Clipper will work.  They are posted with his permission.  The implications of some details are fascinating.  ------- Date: Sat, 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT From: \\\"Martin Hellman\\\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu> To: (a long list of recipients) Subject: Clipper Chip   Most of you have seen the announcement in Friday's NY Times, etc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology) announcing the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" crypto device. Several messges on the net have asked for more technical details, and some have been laboring under understandable misunderstandings given the lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out is your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday to get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing details. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this to Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my facts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know if I have anything wrong):  The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in  Silicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the  same for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit  specific. I don't know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will  call them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message.  The IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so  that the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that  they also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion,  it may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key  will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1  and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow  authorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be  decided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that  they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they  must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased.  When a law enforcement agency gets a court order, they will  present it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and  K2, thereby allowing access to the unit key UK.  In addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his  or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key  plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be  encrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK,  and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part  message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK  producing       E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}  When a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law  enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information  flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that  they may do this constantly on all links, with or without a  court order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links  over which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to        E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number  in the above message. They then check the serial number  of the unit and see if it is on the \\\"watch list\\\" for which they  have a court order. If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K,  and then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M.  I am still in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do  not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed  scheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme  more knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court  order worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not  necessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were  needed, one per escrow authority. While no explanation is needed, the following story adds some color: In researching some ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around, I spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law expert here at Stanford and he related the following story: When Edward Levi became Pres. Ford's attorney general (right after Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent asking for \\\"the wiretap authorizations.\\\" When Levy asked for the details so he could review the cases as required by law, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned over 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not comply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear:  No single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personal keys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi and sometimes a John Mitchell.

All the protected equipment is ALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual  condition of also having them on charge.  If the power fails, big deal -  the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but  there's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it  takes a while).  If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter, why not do it all the time?  Then there'd be no switchover to screw things up, and no having to sense the failure fast.  Just keep the DC on charge when the power is on, and it'll be there in zero time when you \\\"need\\\" it.\",\"    without active participation.

Fixed disk sectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is quite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached, the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance, and it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more loss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence.  The floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the CPU for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr, by the way) really does stink.\",\"1.

The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence-- God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree, Science.   My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations, for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone. Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have  children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that is made possible.   People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death, and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world.   This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely  prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary  alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,   go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us?   I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not, but I will say this:  Before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body they have been given, they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to  believe their search is displeasing to God.\",\"  Why must it be a US Government Space Launch Pad?

Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence \\\"ESC [ 1 B 7\\\"  would indicate that the \\\"HOME\\\" key was pressed, with the shift key down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such as \\\"shift-Return\\\".  If anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code in the source file \\\"x11term.c\\\".  Maybe if someone at OSF is  interested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about  emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods  somewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.  Notes:    * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create    its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which     includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.   * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2    [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].

I wrote that human brains \\\"are infested with sin\\\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.    Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your conscience is properly formed?  The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the formed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure that your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation can be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll grant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.  Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be certain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is `properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)   Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:   The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation? How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or another -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?  You write:   But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I am confident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way from `confident'.  This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain (really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is significantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that you are confident, that invites people to ask why.  Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely certain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any idea of his own fallibility.   I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of them -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible. The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.   Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu  [This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the original criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong answers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal consequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is at least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that -- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are fallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these basic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's unlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of confidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for example said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell, and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and intolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's some chance I'm wrong.  Don't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant Christians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least some cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger. If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for certain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I think it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that way.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most difficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell what I think is the truth.\",\"Does anyone out there know of any products using Motorola's Neuron(r) chips MC143150 or MC143120.

Actions : prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  A good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews says that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated through his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).  Reading Abraham's ``biography'' in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man beset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his wife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by copulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the basis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of  faith'' in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared Abraham as a man of faith. He believed God's promises.  This gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through works, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in performing works.  ``Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit.''

There are other animals on this planet with advanced  mental facilities which have not developed \\\"religion\\\" as a  satisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?   Further, it appears that only humans have a \\\"need\\\" to explain the  unexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,  including those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly  content in their ignorance.   I'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me  from your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal  *only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need  not be researched; 3) religion was \\\"made up\\\" by humans to address a  perceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that  is, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical  structure with biology at the apex).   Needless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the  underlying presuppositions.    I disagree that Christianity is \\\"an infectious cult\\\".  It has  certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in  spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.  That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is  \\\"infectious\\\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides  a workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this  is the case).   I disagree that Christianity is \\\"a safety blanket\\\" which supplants  hope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one  Source of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a  Christian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to  you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose  and externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of  control over one's own life the problem or is it something else?   Finally, one does not appropriate \\\"eternal happiness\\\" by following  Christian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance  of Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people  from their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the  Christian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian  in the Person of God's Spirit.   Heaven is one of two final states that  Christian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally  not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this  promised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived  benefits to them in the here-and-now.    Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a  priority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this  as a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate  priority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,  convert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).  Rather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting  the opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits  of a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful  that it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask  \\\"Why?\\\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-  plished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it  does not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian  is required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of  friendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot  evaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or  harm others if the sole purpose of being a \\\"friend\\\" is to gain a  conversion).   As a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-  ticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \\\"hurry-up\\\"  attitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no  conversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was  coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open  to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).  The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings  conviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part  (witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.    We are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die  just as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more  than this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is  so limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find  a more expansive view.   (For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing  arts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language  of other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?  How is it that humans can organize themselves in various social  structures whereas other animals have only one structure?)    Blatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.  Christianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not  a *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship  with a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-  knit relationship with this appelation.    There are \\\"Jesus freaks\\\" who let the emotional aspects of worship  and Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,  this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these  things flow.    Guilty by association?  That \\\"christianity\\\" which forces itself  upon another is not Christianity at all.    You appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened  2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?   I cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus' influence was a sole  result of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years  gone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert  that nothing about Jesus' life was noteworthy _until_ the sack.    Christianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself.  What do you know of Him? \",\" Yes, but typically they *don't*.  Not every wild flight of fancy serves (or can serve) in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis.  It is somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an example of this sort the *only* one they come up with is the one about Kekule.  Surely, there must be others.  But apparently this is regarded as an *extreme* example of a \\\"non-rational\\\" process in science whereby a successful hypothesis was proposed.  But how non-rational is it?  Of course we can't hope (currently at least) to explain how or why Kekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails. Surely it wasn't the *only* daydream he had.  What was special about *this* one?  Could it have had something to do with a perceived *analogy* between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning geometry of molecules?  Is such analogical reasoning \\\"extra-scientific\\\"? Or is it rather at the very heart of science (Perice's notion of abduction, the use of models within and across disciplines)?  Upon close examination, is there a non-rational mystical leap taking place, or is it perhaps closer to a formal (though often incomplete) analogy or model?\",\"  Sorry to disappoint you but the Red Wings earned the victory...easily.

If Mary was Immaculately concieved, so she    could be a pure vessel, does this mean that she was without sin    and, therefore, the perfect (meaning sinless) female human being?    Is this why she is held so highly in the Catholic Church despite    it's basically patriarchical structure?  She was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to Original Sin, but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life.  This was possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God.  She is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to God, and everything that flows from that relationship.  The Catholic Church sees her as the new Eve.

The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.  Joe Buehler  ...  Schism and Disobedience  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.  The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend \\\"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\\\"  It adds that \\\"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\\\"Not only does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \\\"We pray for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy.\\\"  ...  Intrinsically Schismatic?  The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response.  It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The first part deals with \\\"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church\\\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church.  But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" which is entitled \\\"Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise\\\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is Canon 1382, which reads: \\\"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the Holy See.\\\"  The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder.  I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church.  Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to      The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not     in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with     offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses     against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are     apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a     pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the     exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the     consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh     Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated     he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because     there was no intention of a breach with the Church.  ....  It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy, and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.  Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February 1989 Remnant merits careful study:\",\"  Actually, it's HAPP, and some of their equipment can be found in the  Parts Express catalog (1-800-338-0531).

THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD      Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most      important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God.       Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should      be to know God.      I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three      Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the      Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I      believe that they are individual Persons who are one in      nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each      possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also      equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.      Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.  II.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.      A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for          Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and          unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without          ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.      B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.      C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.          As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,          patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;          Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.      D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely          without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of          sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.          6:3.      E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time          in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all          knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,          infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with          unlimited power over all creation).          God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It          is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day          has become very man-centered, and that the people in our          churches know very little about God.  I believe that the          Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the          people of God need to understand that God is sovereign          in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives          of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes          regarding salvation.  III.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.      A.  In creation           All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in           creating, and all Three are active in sustaining           creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs           (for nations as well as individual people) to the end           of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;           Heb. 1:3.      B.  In salvation          In order to understand salvation I believe that it is          absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man.           All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,          active in salvation.          1.  God, the Father              Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the              Godhead determined in eternity past that there would              be salvation, the conditions under which people              could and would be saved, and even who would be              saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in              Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph              1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.          2.  Christ, the Son of God              The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the              virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two              important works:              a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of                   God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.              b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the                   Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on                   the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by                   His present intercessory work in heaven.  The                   work of salvation will be completed for us when                   the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-                   4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.          3.  The Holy Spirit              As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is              Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is              carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the              following ways:              a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11              b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new                   birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.              c.

The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the controller card, then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main memory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way, then it's not compatible.  Heck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about ISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE drives.  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus, and if IDE did DMA there would be trouble.  (BTW, there are DMA-enabling signals in the IDE cable spec, but the last report I heard was that they are never implemented, because it would require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers.)\",\"Clinton has backed off from the $16 billion jobs bill.

It is because of (1) attitude  and (2) cooperation. In the 'good' neighborhoods, the residents  make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when  strangers are lurking around. 'Good' neighborhoods form groups  like 'crime-watch' to increase this effect, and the relative  effectiveness of the police.

After a large response (about 15 email messages), I've decided that there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g. to warrant posting.  *** file follows ***   Hi Folks;  As perhaps the only Boise resident on the list, I guess it kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial.  Yesterday marked the seating of the jury.  Apparently no other legal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and things start today.  More interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozen Weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the courthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read, \\\"Who stands trial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget) Weaver?\\\"  On the evening news she said, \\\"I am here protesting because I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion. I thought we all did.\\\"  Nice sound bite (grin)!  The news reporter also interviewed some guy named \\\"Tim\\\" who refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge the guy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said he expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial. \\\"Tim\\\" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver and Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop telling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't know the finer points of this one.  Perhaps there's a law against political activity within X feet of a courthouse or something (what happenned to the First Amendment?!?).  Most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed an agent of the Gestapo...err...ATF with a minicam FILMING THE PROTESTORS!  Welcome to the world of Big Brother.  Anyhow, Gerry Spence came out and asked the protestors to leave because he didn't think it would help Weaver's case any.  He said he was confident that, once the evidence came out, that Weaver would be aquitted.

The IR source could be emitting a signature; I'm leaning toward 30 KHz square wave with 50% duty cycle.  I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc. to give information to a pan/tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the angles.  For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LED(s), possibly an Optek OP290 or Motorola MLED81.  Wazing would mean at least 1 Amp current pulses.  At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to 10% and I would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the 50% required.

It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!  It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at .238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game and giving up 6.6/game.   Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo,  Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay, the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen is a big question mark.  In other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William Suero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Today's game with California was cancelled.\",\"    You must not be old enough to remember the A's in KC!\",\" You're assuming that the low-cost delivery system has to be a separate project.  But why?  If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars in hopes of winning a billion-dollar prize, it is *cheaper* to develop your own launch system, charging its entire development cost against your contest entry, than to try to do it with existing launchers.  No other demand is necessary.   You're assuming that it's going to take a decade to build a new launch system.  But why?  The Saturn V took less than six years, depending on exactly when you date its start.  Pegasus took about three from project start to first flight.

Thanks.\",\"My turn to jump in! :)   I think you mean circular, not recursive, but that is semantics. Recursiveness has no problems, it is just horribly inefficient (just ask any assembly programmer.)   The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights, is a complete lie and deception, as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving.  Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost,  almost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable? Similarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to save another, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?   That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty,  especially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable, the serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line, those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be able to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people's life and/or liberty, but is not his own life/liberty inviolate also?  According to the declaration of independence, it is.   Oooh, I like that.  It means that killing an infant is not murder because it cannot be against its will.  Reason, an infant has no will as such.  Similarly for people who are brain dead (easier to see), in a coma, etc.  Also, under current law, accidental killing is still murder.  How will you include that?   The only real golden rule in life is, he who has the gold, makes the rules.  I.e. Might Makes Right.  That is survival.  Now what is wrong with that?   If you mean the golden rule as I stated, yes, almost every system as implemented has used that in reality.  Sorry, I don't deal as much in fiction, as I do in reality.

The distinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people, not people whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these soldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. And resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters). Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by resistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the hostile occupiers in WWII. Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and the Lebanese people are tired of being occupied! They are now turning to the only option they see as viable.

The name of the company is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them).     Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.     His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:   - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use    the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.   - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone    devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.    This stuck them as strange, until now...      Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several concerns over the new Clipper Chip:    - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.    - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto     system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency     of the government.    - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm     is vulnerable over time to an attacker.    - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that     it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or     changing the keys themselves.    - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and     money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed     engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very     difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique     to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is     hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.  Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet. However he told me a little:   - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been    granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is    secure.   - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.    The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret    until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate    the following:      - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but       Mr. Melnick stated \\\"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\\\")      - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.      - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).      - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that       it is _adujustable_ and is \\\"More than adequate for security.\\\"      - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and       can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which       is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I       consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.      - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques       such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the       hardware chip.      - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars       for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced       enough, which probably won't happen]).      - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm       and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted       data into \\\"blocks.\\\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know       what the block header is. This program operates at all supported       RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.      - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!    Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact them, they can be reached at..

You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas  Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to  mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he  has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all  followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education  here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according  to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational  system.              His philosophy of government, his belief in the  importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest  here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us  President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in  the Chamber of Commerce studios.                Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for  taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite  network and we welcome you here this evening.              Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.   And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening  also.              I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure  many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that  you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In  Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.              I believe the President has a few words that he might  want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that  at this time.  It's great to have you.              THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.              I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob  Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the  Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making,  along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine  tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people  from school to the work place.              I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts,  recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this  economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to  work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to  make things happen.              This satellite town meeting is a good example of that  kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home  state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart  Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing  several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I  appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all  the rest of you.              I have tried as hard as I could to move toward  constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about  this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson  believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in  education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion,  freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and  third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.                If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this  beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful  cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change  with changing times.              For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit  and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we  can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless  we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in  government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase  our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the  long run.              We also have to have people who can carry their load.   And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven  or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system  and continues into the work force where education must go on for a  lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can  learn.              And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing  we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership  between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the  private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're  trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that  would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many  thousands that have a strong education component so our young people  can be learning and working at the same time.              Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good  place we can begin, I think, the discussion.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.              Each month we get together and talk about ways that all  citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And  tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours  can prepare students for this world of work.              This week, the Education Department and the Labor  Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called  Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.   The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's  proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched  jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged  areas of the country.                Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it  somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls  for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your  words is that so important?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.   First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may  have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want  them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to  continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of  research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may  forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year  over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for  schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already  taught before.              Secondly, we want to help these young people progress,  not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to  abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is  learning because we think that the best and most productive workers  will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience  could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to  succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are  disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go  into the next year, is really even greater.                Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs  throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this  educational component of training.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr.  Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer  or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with  education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people,  for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning  geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or  working on something, and they can see the exact and direct  application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a  lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between  education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.   It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of  young people even beyond the summer.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.                Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship  program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell  us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it  developing.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why  it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade  will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will  require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people  get in a high school diploma.                If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries  of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school  education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young  people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not  go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because  they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their  employers.              So we think America has a big economic interest in  trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school  but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes  two years of further training either in a community college, a  vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in  this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some  funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states  and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in  a way that would be customized essentially by the business community,  based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could  revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and  the earnings of American workers.              SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think  you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the  people watching this program -- that the business community and  educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many  of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In  fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The  people watching this program probably are the ones who are most  directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley  and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes  already out there.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight  about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning   career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal  with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of  these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and  you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much  longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business  community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're  doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The  Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these  kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've  aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.              The business community is going to be actively engaged  in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and  helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions  develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.              Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is  one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these  players in a community come together and work together and cooperate  together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and  the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody  is talking, but they're not really working together in a common  strategy.              And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick,  would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic  excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a  tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to  make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be  eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year  college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're  talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation  skills for on-the-job learning.              And again, those are the critical components.  It's  already being done.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one  point based on my personal experience at home -- the business  community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are  the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught,  but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort  of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are  going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the  second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and  influence them.  So I think that's very important.              And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at  the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some  funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make  sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the  quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to  determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.              SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of  course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery  program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about  long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr.  President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the  communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be  coming forth before too long.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I  were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public  schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that  a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.                I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals  that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President  Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to  do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in  Congress that will actually define the things that the national  government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the  children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those  goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school  ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school  graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are  confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are  second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe,  disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took  them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of  life-long learning in this country.              And each one of those goals there's a national role, a  state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector  role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to  introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is;  and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job  is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality  that we need to meet.              It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite  like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.   Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their  money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and  partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really  it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms  of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to  support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform  efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.              Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to  the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of  course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and  I wonder if you would comment on that.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of  our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they  don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system  of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had  national skill standards to which they could aspire and which  employers would understand as a national credential, many of these  young people would actually find that they were much more eligible  for jobs.              Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other  countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to  college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain  technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If  you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to  develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working  with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private  industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the  kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other  institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go  ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce  Todd of Austin, Texas.              Q   Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and  Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We  have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who  have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me  simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with  much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are  very supportive.                We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our  summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to  have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much  as 3,500 with the federal assistance.                Much of the question that we had designed you have  answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But  the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day  would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round  is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal  level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the  local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's  something that we believe is very important to success in this  effort.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to  answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling,  and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.   I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.                First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can  structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer  program and that will move a lot of these young people back into  schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in  the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to  try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs  to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're  working on that.              Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the  Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to  build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job  training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give  heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you  asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we  hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being  trained on a year-round basis.              And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said  a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen  as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people  actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when  they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we  hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and  we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget  cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue  raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be  able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.              Bob, do you want to say anything?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out  of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing,  and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high  school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in  addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of  jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.   It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the  economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything  else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I  think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I  think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or  greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going  to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything  right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000  will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into  next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it  will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working  together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And  then the state, with all the various school districts, a very  important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I  think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that  moving.              The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.                Doctor?              Q   Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to  be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school  and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since  its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two  alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages  we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an  extremely effective learning strategy.              And over the years, we've come to believe that there are  several principles that are very important in bridging the school and  work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with  practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure  to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect  upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and  lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the  development of high performance competencies.                My question, then is:  How can the general education  faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with  transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies  can you suggest to achieve this integration?              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think --  and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting  work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next  guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists    in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to  them and we can discuss it later.              You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?              THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one  thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as  clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the  people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more  explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics  is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish  what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is  vocational learning and what is academic learning.              I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think  we should have a strong component for people who are in the  vocational program.              SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to  rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and  work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're  important for all students.  It's not just a special group of  students that needs them.              Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United  States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream  experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and  12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience  and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on  to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they  can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and  career directions.              But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often  goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom, within our schools.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's  going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I  think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank  you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and  your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \",\"The Clipper Chip will have no effect.

Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced to give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike Foligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy Ruff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who retired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it? After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit. Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in reverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'm not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit and Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know if the captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he played for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)  Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded, almost, unless you're a franchise player. \",\"Excerpts from netnews.alt.atheism: 15-Apr-93 Re: thoughts on christians by Dave Fuller@portal.hq.vi  I think it'd help if we got a couple good atheists (or even some good, steadfast agnostics) in some high political offices.  When was the last time we had an (openly) atheist president?  Have we ever?  (I don't actually know; these aren't rhetorical questions.)  How 'bout some Supreme court justices?

I suggested we go talk to the priest, and she agreed.  The priest was amazingly cool about it...He basically said that if I didn't believe it, there was no good in forcing it on me.

Chris  \",\"     From what I read, the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together over the phone.  The bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type, so to put a (I assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together from instructions _over the phone_ (!) one must need some brains I would expect.    I read this in an article in \\\"The Australian Muslim Times\\\", the newspaper (weekly) of the Australian Muslim community.    If this is true, perhaps one of the Muslims based in North America (if they see this posting) can elaborate.       I don't deny this fact.  The thrust of my argument here is that   (a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.  (b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important  distinction.  I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \\\"Muslim\\\".  In general, anyone who calls themselves a \\\"Muslim\\\" and does not do or  outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam is considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to Islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a Muslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential principles, though, then one does leave Islam.  The term \\\"Muslim\\\" is to be contrasted with \\\"Mu'min\\\", which means \\\"true believer\\\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is something known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you will not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism, because it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I, for example, am a \\\"true believer\\\" or not.  For example, I could just be putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \\\"Muslims\\\" we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in practice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.

Anthony Fauci, director of the  U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said,  \\\"We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly  can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will  get around microbial resistance.\\\"  He said any delay would signify questions  over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  Fauci, who co- authored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the   argument by one of his co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new  discovery  indicates that \\\"$1 billion spent on vaccine trials\\\" has been \\\"a waste of time  and money\\\" because the trials were started  too long after the patients were  infected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College of  Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument  for  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.

This finding  supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of  contracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the  JAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive  surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies  were conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and  Florida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and  tested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found  that none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an   HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.  In Maryland, 413 of 1,131  patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at  Johns Hopkins Hospital  were found to be HIV-negative.

The Florida researchers, led by  Gordon  M. Dickinson of the University of Miami School of Medicine, said,  \\\"This study indicates that the risk for transmission of HIV from  a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in  which universal  precautions are strictly observed.\\\"   Related Story: Philadelphia Inquirer  (04/14) P.

The OAM is a small division of  the NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10  billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available  research grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be  available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for  Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid  to become involved in AIDS.  \\\"They have to look successful and there is no  easy answer in AIDS,\\\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the  OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening,  such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an  advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS  community was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists'  general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic  will be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \\\"The OAM advisory  panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It   will take them several years to accept the nature of research.\\\"    Nevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator  at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \\\"Here is a  wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.

Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus- 6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack  causes the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in  the immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a  factor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research   found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte,  which is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  kill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural  killer cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's   research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural  killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony  L. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube  findings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the  body.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor   molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface  receptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that  herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.       ======================================================================                                    April 15, 1993       ====================================================================     \\\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\\\" Journal of the  American Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert,  George and Nordenberg, Dale F.)        All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only  ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health  problems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert  and Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana,  Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,   respectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care  about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for  the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should  be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it  is not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many   respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic  development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.   Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have  on many developing countries, and the increased need for international  assistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political  aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there  is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach  to international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in  particular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \\\"Earth in the  Balance\\\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable  international development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child  survival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the  developing  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically   change the future of worldwide health.  ====================================================================    \\\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\\\" Journal of the American   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth)        Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible  before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less  attention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller  Foundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and  Nordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as  malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited   economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention  than they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is  receiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most  developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic  diseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another  year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS  and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden  but financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a  rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each  individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley  says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and   economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he  concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the  United States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries  with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic   has been the rule.

The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90  children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV- infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease.   HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \\\"a  hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected  children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\\\"   Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \\\"is  the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay  disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\\\"  If these  vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their  therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in  the United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health  Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide.   The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which  funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial  at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the  ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development.   Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows  that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers  know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease.   The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined  closely for other reasons as well.  \\\"This trial will provide the first insight  into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\\\" said  Daniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  \\\"We need this  information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent  HIV infection in children.\\\"   In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city  areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic.   Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during  pregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than  a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing  numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection  drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding  increase in the numbers of infected children.   HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.   The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV  develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These  infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of  childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms  leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays.   At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger  to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older  participants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no  symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen  liver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune- regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study.   Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical  School, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of  Medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical  officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS.   \\\"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children  for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or  fevers, for example, than another,\\\" said Dr. McNamara.  \\\"We'll also look at  whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other  significant laboratory or clinical effects.\\\"   He emphasized that the small  study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  products.   The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from  recombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically  engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well- tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults.   One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a  protein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.   Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is  the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug  Administration.   Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco  and the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in  Emeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus  adjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine  contains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in  other Phase I vaccine trials in adults.   A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15  children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the  experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone,  considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will  be told what they receive.   If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the  experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will  begin.   Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six  months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

They report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling  skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the  HIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals'  immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV  itself caused the skin disease.   Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease  without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the  National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues  described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human  Retroviruses.   Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most  animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this  problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for  HIV as well as their own genetic material.   NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse  eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters  contained both normal and transgenic animals.   Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV  genetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon  after birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an  incomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer.   Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their  necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin  lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No  skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates.   Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a  type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can  cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the  animals.   Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the  presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.    HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \\\"turned  on,\\\" or active, said Dr. Kopp.   The scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the  mice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common  infections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune  systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the  skin lesions, Dr. Kopp said.   Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists  exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV  genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.   Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the  genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No  lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light.   The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter  Dickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases.   Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs.  Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR;  Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney,  formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.

Shalala today announced the first nationwide  clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care  professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV  infection or AIDS.       The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a  physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on  drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is  funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of  San Francisco General Hospital.       Secretary Shalala said, \\\"One goal of this project is to share expertise  so patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health  care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces  treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and  community social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients  with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\\\"       Secretary Shalala said, \\\"This clinical expertise should be especially  helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in  communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\\\"       The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and  it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST)  Monday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer  questions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and  health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be  answered as quickly as possible.       Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question  related to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment  information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral,  literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health  care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate  sources of information or materials.       When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken  by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse  practitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and  inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant  asks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current  medications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history.

It was the Phils only win in the three game series, and was the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the young season.   The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2 John Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers.  However Danny Jackson, and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead. Mitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4, however Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it.  In the 11th, Dave Hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the year to push the Phils ahead to stay.  However, in a shaky bottom of the 11th the Cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base when the Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan (they were out of position players) and Myers bunted into a double play to end the game.\",\"I just installed a DX2-66 CPU in a clone motherboard, and tried mounting a CPU  cooler on the chip.

Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere  that they are on the surface of. Similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the surface of.  These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design meet these problems neatly.  When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear the algorithm should afil or return infinite R. When intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities they are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle) they are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius.  This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced  it can also be achieved by  If all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle.   It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar. The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar. (4 points being colinear => coplanar)  Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points has been found is trivial.  \",\"1975 H-1 500      Brand new top end      Chambers      Clean + black!      1,500$      Paul: (510) 839-2161  Please do not contact this email address: contact the seller.

NOT the fault of CView.  It is DOS!  If you leave a file open on a floppy drive, then change the disk and do something which updates or closes that file, you have a good chance of getting part of the directory and FAT from the other disk written to the new disk.  This has always been true, and has destroyed data under other programs, not just CView.  The only thing CView can do to improve the situation is to try not to leave files open unless it's actively using them (ie, reading and decoding). \",\"  I think this to be inaccurate. One can buy TEMPEST equipment commercially. Even Macs.  David\",\"  One of the things I find intersting about pagan beliefs is their belief in a feminine deity as well as a masculine deity. Being brought up in a Christian household, I often wondered if there was God the Father, where was the mother? Everyone I know who has a father usually as a mother. It just seemed rather unbalanced to me.   Fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not fall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both a masculine and feminine force. It provides a sense of balance I find sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which I think is responsible for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat each other.\",\" There are a couple.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design     team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.       ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into     Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20     Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas     scintillation proportional counters.       CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint     NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian     system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.     After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA     trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon     arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens     Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours     while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter     continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and     targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the     mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,     rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's     satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.      One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.      The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the     first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of     Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan     Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true     nature of Saturn's rings.

MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire     surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity     map.       MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.     Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in     transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for     one martian year (687 days).       TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched     8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the     TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global     observations of the sea level for several years, substantially     increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also     will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.       ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over     its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields     experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for     various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.      Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of     the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from     that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist     manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole     in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its     perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft     that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!      While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and     radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see     *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical     detail, see the many articles in the same issue.

I'm attempting to track changes based     on updated shuttle manifests; corrections and updates are welcome.      1993 Missions  o ALEXIS [spring, Pegasus]      ALEXIS (Array of Low-Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors) is to perform      a wide-field sky survey in the \\\"soft\\\" (low-energy) X-ray      spectrum. It will scan the entire sky every six months to search      for variations in soft-X-ray emission from sources such as white      dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars and flare stars. It will also      search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron      stars and gamma-ray bursters. ALEXIS is a project of Los Alamos      National Laboratory and is primarily a technology development      mission that uses astrophysical sources to demonstrate the      technology. Contact project investigator Jeffrey J Bloch      (jjb@beta.lanl.gov) for more information.   o Wind [Aug, Delta II rocket]      Satellite to measure solar wind input to magnetosphere.   o Space Radar Lab [Sep, STS-60 SRL-01]      Gather radar images of Earth's surface.   o Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer [Dec, Pegasus rocket]      Study of Stratospheric ozone.   o SFU (Space Flyer Unit) [ISAS]      Conducting space experiments and observations and this can be      recovered after it conducts the various scientific and      engineering experiments. SFU is to be launched by ISAS and      retrieved by the U.S. Space Shuttle on STS-68 in 1994.      1994  o Polar Auroral Plasma Physics [May, Delta II rocket]      June, measure solar wind and ions and gases surrounding the      Earth.   o IML-2 (STS) [NASDA, Jul 1994 IML-02]      International Microgravity Laboratory.   o ADEOS [NASDA]      Advanced Earth Observing Satellite.   o MUSES-B (Mu Space Engineering Satellite-B) [ISAS]      Conducting research on the precise mechanism of space structure      and in-space astronomical observations of electromagnetic waves.      1995  LUNAR-A [ISAS]      Elucidating the crust structure and thermal construction of the      moon's interior.       Proposed Missions:  o Advanced X-ray Astronomy Facility (AXAF)      Possible launch from shuttle in 1995, AXAF is a space      observatory with a high resolution telescope. It would orbit for      15 years and study the mysteries and fate of the universe.   o Earth Observing System (EOS)      Possible launch in 1997, 1 of 6 US orbiting space platforms to      provide long-term data (15 years) of Earth systems science      including planetary evolution.   o Mercury Observer      Possible 1997 launch.   o Lunar Observer      Possible 1997 launch, would be sent into a long-term lunar      orbit. The Observer, from 60 miles above the moon's poles, would      survey characteristics to provide a global context for the      results from the Apollo program.   o Space Infrared Telescope Facility      Possible launch by shuttle in 1999, this is the 4th element of      the Great Observatories program. A free-flying observatory with      a lifetime of 5 to 10 years, it would observe new comets and      other primitive bodies in the outer solar system, study cosmic      birth formation of galaxies, stars and planets and distant      infrared-emitting galaxies   o Mars Rover Sample Return (MRSR)      Robotics rover would return samples of Mars' atmosphere and      surface to Earch for analysis. Possible launch dates: 1996 for      imaging orbiter, 2001 for rover.   o Fire and Ice      Possible launch in 2001, will use a gravity assist flyby of      Earth in 2003, and use a final gravity assist from Jupiter in      2005, where the probe will split into its Fire and Ice      components: The Fire probe will journey into the Sun, taking      measurements of our star's upper atmosphere until it is      vaporized by the intense heat. The Ice probe will head out      towards Pluto, reaching the tiny world for study by 2016. \",\"On 20-Apr-93 in Don Cherry - Coach's Corner..

No tickets, no accidents, own a house, have taken defensive driving 1, airbag, abs, security alarm, single.   $1500/year  $500 decut. State Farm Insurance (this includes the additional $100 for the $1,000,000 umbrella policy over my car and house)  The base policy is the standard $100,000 - $100,000 - $300,000 policy required in DE.   After 2nd defensive driving course it will be 5% less.   I bought the car in September 1992.  The company I was with (never had and accident or ticket in 11 years) quoted me $2,500.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years). I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling (and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury car.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924. I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car.   \\\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as the Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue to handle your account.   \\\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard [higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with a 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year, but cancel you after that.\\\"   \\\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually faster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\\\"    That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers - as very traditional and conservative.\\\"   I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure guy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft.      /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.   / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil ========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======           ======================================================================== 32   I live in Idaho.

I'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx in advance)  I want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There \\\"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.\\\"          Thanx in advance... Shaz....  [I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions. The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style of the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significant differences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying text.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by hand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the original, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are generally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved, but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there's much uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error.  But I also don't think there's enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that it has much practical effect.  Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot topic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it (though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details that don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there being multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in all the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've been referring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get referenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been editions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into single narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor objects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible has long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making editions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from a variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine one of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all inaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any edition that's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is. (Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a few translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best, I'm afraid.)\",\"The Blackhawks shall triumph.\",\" ^^^^^^^^^^                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   !!!!!!^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    It is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to use the net to directly advertise their products.

Around a million Americans every year defend themselves with firearms.  In many of these cases the defender doesn't even have to fire a shot!  The mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the deterrent that is needed.  I don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  But, taking away the right of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent crime problem in this country.  If honest, law-abiding citizens are unable to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will be able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling guns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns should be banned by the Klintonistas.   Statistics, por favor?   See my previous post.  That ought to set you straight.   People have the right to keep and bear arms no matter what the Constitution says.

I wanted to send him a comment on something in his terraforming book.   Paul F. Dietz  dietz@cs.rochester.edu\",\"    Now this is getting interesting!  I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some reason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean the raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:  1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was  pretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right now.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the \\\"great judgement\\\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day). I was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my \\\"soul\\\" (which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?  2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms  that my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My physical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be tortured for all eternity?  3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical place to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth? Do you think we could find it if we dig?  Mark Schnitzius schnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu Univ. of Central Florida  [There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur until a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the meantime, some believe that people \\\"sleep\\\" until the final resurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe that souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then. There are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.  The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a different \\\"technology\\\" than the current one, one which is not mortal. (Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus' resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not subject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other, but I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don't think I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be some analog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky.  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension, outside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have little in the way of details.\",\"/(emery) /The one single historic event that has had the biggest impact on the /world over the centuries is the resurrection of Jesus.    This is hardly possible, as the majority of people in the world were born, lived their life, and died, without ever knowing anything about Christ.  The majority of the rest of the world have decided that he  is not who Emery thinks he is.    /(emery) /Why were the writers of the New Testament documents so convinced that /Jesus really did rise from the dead? /We have four gospel accounts.

And if we accept the bible as true just because the bible says it is true, then (to be fair) we have to do the same to the Bhagavad-Gita and the Koran, both of which contradict the bible.  Enough said.    /(emery) /Yet we have no reason to believe these disciples to be immoral and dishonest. /We have no historic information that would lead us to the conclusion that /these people were not God-fearing people who sincerely and whole-heartedly /believed that the resurrection of their Lord Jesus was a real event. /And for what gain would they lie?  To make a stand at that time meant  /persecution, imprisonment, and perhaps even death.  Again, this is only the biblical account and there is no independent proof of any of this happening.  It just isn't there.  Besides, simply being sincere or willing to die for your faith does not make your faith correct.

Roman historian, Cornelius  /Tacitus, Govenor of Asia, in A.D. 112, writing of Nero's reign, alluded to  /the torture of Christians in Rome:   All you have proven is that these people were tortured for their faith.  That does not prove that their faith is true or correct; it just means that they were sincere in their beliefs.   Being willing to die for what you believe doesn't make your belief the truth. It's not that easy.  And minority religions have always suffered torture; Muslims suffer torture and harassment in India and Bosnia today.  All religions are harassed in China today.  You haven't proven anything so far.    /(emery) /With all the suffering and persecution that it meant to be a believer, it /would be quite probable that at least one of those in the supposed conspiracy /would come forward and confess that the whole thing was a big hoax.

Thus, Hasan is wrong.   The word \\\"troops\\\" is unjustified.  There has never been any evidence that there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the village apart from the villagers defending themselves.  According to the Haganah observer Pa'il, the Irgun/Lehi forces suffered a lot of casualties because they were incompetent soldiers.  When they ran into trouble securing the central part of the village, a small group  of Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty. Begin's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of the major inaccuracies (to use a kind word) in his account.  Incidentally, \\\"three times as heavy\\\" may be correct, as there is serious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives than to the oft-quoted 250 lives.  However, note that Begin compares wounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number of wounded Arabs.  Guess why.   As is thoroughly established by many sources, the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a usueful warning.   It is worth noting how Begin disputes the standard myth that the Palestinian Arabs fled as part of a calculated plan.   Apparently 90% of Israeli historians are Jew-haters.

I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme is to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange, either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme like Diffie-Hellman.  If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone company or some other online central authority generates a session key and sends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of having some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for a copy of the session key for each call.      Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of every public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably, there will be some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally- signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit, stored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to everyone's public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to the security of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you don't use your designated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips.

How do I make a screendump or print my application?   The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window  or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window.  The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr  client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:   csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd & and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current display will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an undocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the  command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for  specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]   Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of  arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc. There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92] is the most recent.  xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders  XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr; see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.  A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information:  soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.  xprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.   To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr, which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps and XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for  use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive servers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.   The XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and save it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.   Also:    Bristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter  2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net in vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.   ColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen- capture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and  non-PostScript printers.   Some vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows)  include session managers or other desktop programs which include \\\"print portion of screen\\\" or \\\"take a snapshot\\\" options. Some platforms also have tools which  can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example,  have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals  have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.   Some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct  support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package  to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?   If you need color PostScript in particular, you can   - grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color  PostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv   - grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS. You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick  distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?   This can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider  instead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?   The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++  Portable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting  among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps,  gray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently; the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.  Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in  particular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary. It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).   Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are  later versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.   Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export;  see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.   xv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley),  can read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF,  GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity,  contrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned  formats plus PostScript.

Version 1.0 available via FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z,  and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.   The Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads and writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.   The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar  to PBMPLUS.

Xim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential  interactive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is  a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and  Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif,  xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a library and command-line utilities for building your own applications.   ImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from  export's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display images on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF from other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.   xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining simple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90] xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.   A version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool is available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package  also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget.

The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the string which appears in the window titlebar.  A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell:   echo \\\"ESC]2;TEXT^G\\\" where ESC is the escape key, TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed, and ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character).   Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change directories:   alias newcd 'cd \\\\!*; echo -n ESC]2\\\\;$cwd^G'   The digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should  change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name  used in the icon, use the digit '0' instead, and use '1' to change only the  icon name.   Note: another way to do this, which prevents an incorrect display of the local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell, is to wrap the escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself.   Note: on an IBM RS/6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with a ^V.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  29)  Where can I find the xterm control sequences?  The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file  ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z.  O'Reilly's Volume 3, the X User's Guide, includes an R5 version of the control  sequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93, and a Motif version of  the book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version of the control sequences. [1/93]  Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document and also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a  compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100  sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was  published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).  In a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.

In order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to  \\\"stty pass8\\\" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as   XTerm*font:  -*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1  XTerm*boldfont: -*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 [The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]  In addition, you may want to set this in your shell:  setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1          For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with  the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using `man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (')  is Alt-'.

You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give  a resource specification like this:   xterm*geometry: 80x24 then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to 80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size.  But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:   xterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?   You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command.  However, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for  manipulating the selection will help; e.g.   % xselection PRIMARY | lpr finds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a  window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties. A version is on export.  Also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be adapted to do this.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?   You can use several environment variables to control how resources are  loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and  XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for  application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.   Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a  way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies. Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also  have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could  set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up  app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located):  setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N  The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see  XtResolvePathname()):          %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the                 application's class name.         %T      The value of the file \\\"type\\\".  In this case, the                 literal string \\\"app-defaults\\\"         %C      customization resource (R5 only)         %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.         %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \\\"ja_JP.EUC\\\")         %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \\\"ja\\\")         %t      The territory part of the display's language string         %c      The codeset part of the display's language string   Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is  \\\"Myterm\\\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the  example omits locale-specific lookup.)  /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm  $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm   As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above  app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it  and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to  search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.   Let's consider another example. This time, let's set  XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working  directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.  setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N   The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands  to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging  because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file  Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and %S are useless.   With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization  resource value.  For example, you might run the \\\"myterm\\\" application like this:  myterm -xrm \\\"*customization: -color\\\"   If one of your pathname specifications had the value \\\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\\\" then the expanded pathname would be \\\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\\\" because the %C substitution character  takes on the value of the customization resource.   The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:   /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N   (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.)   The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is    <root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   <root>/%L/%N:\\\\   <root>/%l/%N:\\\\   <root>/%N:   <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory  if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other  than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.   Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find  your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR  to \\\".\\\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3  compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \\\"./\\\", a dot followed  by a slash.

The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources; for example,  your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line   DisplayManager.0.authorize: false  to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also   DisplayManager*xrdb: /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:  #!/bin/sh  #comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources  /usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap  /usr/bin/X11/xrdb $* Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.

When xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login files. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script; or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and source it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or, if you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your  .xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting your .xsession file off with \\\"#!/bin/csh\\\".   If this doesn't work, also try starting off with:   #!/bin/sh   # Reset path:   PATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?   There are several ways to avoid having to do a \\\"setenv DISPLAY ...\\\" whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.  One solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It  includes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and xrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine. A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.  One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from 132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and $DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then  propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain   eval `xrlogind` where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special  format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to  recreate the environment variables. [11/90]   In addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on  another host, and you find   rsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY  too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh  can be used to start up remote X processes.

One way is to use the \\\"bitmap\\\" client or some other bitmap-editor (e.g. Sun's icon-editor tool, post-processed with pbmplus) to design the individual  characters and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate  them into the BDF format. See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X  Journal for more information.  The R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained  a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.  An easier way is to use the \\\"xfed\\\" client to modify an existing font; a version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is  available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63],  possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce BDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.  The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors, XPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in /pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed  [5/91] in export:/contrib.   If you are a MetaFont user you can use \\\"mftobdf\\\" from the SeeTeX distribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe, a font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.  The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these tools to modify a font.  Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?   After you have built the font using your system's font-compiler,  installed it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent (e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp  $dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the  directory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably  leaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in  the path.)  Sometimes your \\\"xset +fp $dir\\\" command fails with a BadValue error:   X Error of failed request:BadValue    (integer parameter out of range for operation)   Major opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)   This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The mention of an \\\"integer parameter\\\" in the message is spurious.)  -- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file    system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your    font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an    xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \\\"xset +fp ~/myfonts\\\") and    the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.  -- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server    (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file    \\\"fonts.dir\\\".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're    running OpenWindows, look for the file \\\"Families.list\\\".  If you can't find    it, run bldfamily(1).)  -- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a    proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for    example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.    Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for    Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work    for X11Rn.

The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation, but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file  contrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is  for a standard MIT R4 server.

The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the \\\".pcf\\\" format. You can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc font-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a performance hit.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?) I want to be able to do something like this:  xclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave   You can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the  same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because  of this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since  there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore,  neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap  converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a  resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for  use in many of its widgets, however. [courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]  However:  A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of  the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick  (basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of  image formats as a pixmap.   The leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used  by Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by AT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM  distribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write  routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information on the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on  the R5 contrib tape.

The Xsun server as distributed by MIT doesn't do this but there are two different patches available.   The first patch is written by Jonathan Lemon and fixes the Num Lock related  problems. It is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in the file contrib/Xsun-R5.numlock_patch.Z .   The second is written by Martin Forssen and fixes the Num Lock and Compose keys and adds support for the different national keyboard layouts for Type-4 and  Type-5 keyboards. This patch is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/sunkbd1216-0314.tar.Z or via email from maf@dtek.chalmers.se.   [thanks to Martin Forssen (maf@dtek.chalmers.se or maf@math.chalmers.se), 8/92]  A set of patches by William Bailey (dbgwab@arco.com) was posted to newsgroups 11/92 to provide support for the Type-5 keyboard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  51)  How do I report bugs in X?   Generally, report bugs you find to the organization that supplied you with the X Window System. If you received the R5 source distribution directly  from MIT, please read the file mit/bug-report for instructions. [Look in mit/doc/bugs/bug-report in R4.]  [Thanks to Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>, 5/91; 12/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  52)  Why do I get \\\"Warning: Widget class version mismatch\\\"?   This error, which typically goes on to say, \\\"widget 11004 vs.  intrinsics 11003\\\" indicates that the header files you included when building  your program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking  against was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure.  However, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the  X11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun OW systems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library,  and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you have seen.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  53)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster?   Webster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster's Dictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became aware that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster  and gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access.  [The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. A Webster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu  (129.79.254.192) in \\\"pub/webster/NeXT-2.0\\\".]  Unless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site which can grant you access, you are probably out of luck.    However, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up the latest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file  xwebster.README includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and  non-availability of dictionary servers.    [courtesy steve@UMIACS.UMD.EDU (Steve Miller) and mayer@hplabs.hp.com (Niels  Mayer) 11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  54)  TOPIC: OBTAINING X AND RELATED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  55)  Is X public-domain software?   No. The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not  \\\"public domain\\\", which has a specific legal meaning. However, the X  distribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee.  Contributed software, though, may be placed in the public domain by individual authors.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  56)  How compatible are X11R3, R4, and R5? What changes are there?  The Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the  previous release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility  across releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary,  details are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the  network also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the  file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.  [Stephen Gildea, 1/92]  The comp.windows.x.intrinsics FAQ-Xt lists Xt differences among these versions.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  57)! Where can I get X11R5 (source and/or binaries)?  Information about MIT's distribution of the sources on 6250bpi and QIC-24 tape  and its distribution of hardcopy of the documents is available from  Software Center, Technology Licensing Office, Massachusetts Institute of  Technology, 28 Carleton Street, Room E32-300, Cambridge MA 02142-1324, phone: 617-258-8330.  You will need about 100Mb of disk space to hold all of Core and 140MB to hold the Contrib software donated by individuals and companies.   PLEASE use a site that is close to you in the network.  Note that the RELEASE notes are generally available separately in the same directory; the notes list changes from previous versions of X and offer a guide to the distribution.

When I eat foods with MSG I get very thirsty and my hands swell and get a terrible itchy rash.

I try to avoid MSG completely.  Interesting fact though is that all three of my children started experiencing the exact same rash on their hands.  I couldn't understand why because I don't MSG in cooking and we ask for no MSG when we do eat Chinese (I still love it).  After some investigation I knew that Oodles of Noodles where one of their favorite foods.  One of the main ingredients in the flavor packets is MSG.  Now I look at all labels.  You would be surprised at places you find MSG. \",\"    I disagree.  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real- istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they still go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is  bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are trying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect  examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals that would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to attract, that these players are indeed superstars.    It ain't nearly so simple as this.  The casual fan doesn't think about much  at all.  Can you actually find an adult with a 3 digit IQ who believes that McDonalds makes good hamburgers?    Yes but apparently the Rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi- bilities has he?  He was hyped, initially, as a superstar, but outside of one Grey Cup game he has done very little to maintain/enhance that assess- ment of his talents.  Most Argo fans probably feel the team would be better off without him.   cordially, as always,  rm \",\"I responded to a post last week and it carried somewhat of a hostile tone for which I am apologizing for.

E.G. homoeopathy: like cures like.  The more you dilute things, the more powerful they get, even if you dilute them so much there is no ingredient but water left.  Chiropractic: all illness stems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae.  Such systems are so patently absurd, that any good they do is accidental and not related to the theory.  The only exception is probably herbalism, because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants and are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants that have active and useful substances.  But that isn't what  is meant by alternative medicine, usually.  If you get into the Qi, accupuntunce charts, etc, you are now back to silly theories that probably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases.

And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the inevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are doing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is possible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the eyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing people for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and Annias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His plan might be accomplished.     But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to execute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to fulfill the chorus of \\\"Let his blood be upon our hands\\\" of the crowd in Jersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel, which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish other nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament.  Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, \\\"Mene, mene, tekel, peres?\\\"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's justice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians as their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the extirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel.  The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and the Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go on with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is quite clear. Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to question why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom, He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans 9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of Jesus Christ is as follows: \\\"Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.\\\"  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - \\\"Let the dead bury the dead, come, follow me.\\\"  There is not an infinite amount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to follow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, \\\"well, alright, you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your plans.\\\"  He said \\\"Follow me.\\\"  His message is NOT \\\"I'm just a sweety-pie who would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and Divine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale.\\\"  \\\"Our great God and Savior\\\" Jesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the world.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.\",\"Roland HS-60 (SynthPlus 60)   - 6 voice polyphonic fully programmable analog synthesizer   - 61 full size keys   - MIDI   - Memory to store 128 patches   - built in speakers   - Connectors: MIDI in thru out, Input(2), Expansion Pedal, Head Phones,     Tape Load & Save, Patch Shift, Pedal Hold, Output(2)  Asking $225\",\"Forsale:  Proton P1100 preamplifier ========================= About 3.5 years old, originally $299, asking $150 or best offer.

To one brought up, as most Americans have   been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of   the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious  differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they  were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every   nation in the world would have treated as treasonable.

Shaw  (History),  who  recently completed  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the Turkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in Rescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution, 1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree program in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for the Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the G. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.  Editor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and European and Turkish Jews?  Shaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish. I've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as time went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews, I collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a couple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the 500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and coming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire Avenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman Jewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became motivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The Jews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book is quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who tend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint of the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish sources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I approach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of view of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I finished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across additional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War II. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good deal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not actually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in the Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish diplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It was too late to add this new information to the book in press, so I decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research, mainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the Turkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second book, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped rescue Jews from the Nazis.  - How exactly did they do this?  The story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents the material in three parts, first of which deals with the period before the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in 1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi Germans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and the like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of reforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were being fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new talent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three months  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey arranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and were   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish universities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical personnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors came to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political scientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in Turkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the Berlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist, came to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics in Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the Nazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually came to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other German Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey. One  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical producer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to Turkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the Turkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul Hindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first phase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by Turkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in Turkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded themselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in the anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I even  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey praising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting the idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been persecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the Nazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The second part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in 1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and especially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They had migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of the century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the Turkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was threatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews throughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might happen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled to France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their Turkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the Nazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of anti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not worth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot to be a Turkish Jew.  - How so?  Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained its embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries until it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the end of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position to  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the actions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of the  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in particular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from the Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish citizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were arrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats would  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other officials and say in effect:  \\\"These people are Turkish citizens. You  can't do  this  to  them.\\\" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be released.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.  The Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey. They hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion of the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and manganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they usually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews. The Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps to secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded trains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and succeeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews were sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in Paris,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish consuls took place.  The greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned their  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The consuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens because  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews lining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get passports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their Turkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so processing the application would take  some time. In the meantime it was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on the streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them if they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because radios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of these  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a document called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  \\\"irregular fellow citizen.\\\" The  document said in  effect \\\"This person is  a former Turkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his Turkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if you  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.\\\"  The diplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on it. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they accepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this means, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who had relinquished their Turkish citizenship.  Actually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of Jews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to retain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these interventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all Jews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to prevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz before the Turkish consuls could do anything.  - Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?  There were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War II,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the information in this section of  the book relates to the situation in France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls sent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in reply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would present  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are Turkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the Nazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish consuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from Nazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran regularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas so they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were often  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern Europe  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these governments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result of the Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish Jews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to Auschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either escaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of southern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much better than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy fell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well. Incidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also worked to rescue Jews in that country.  - The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats acting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin from Nazi persecution.  Yes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their interventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their treaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German territory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey. On  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not discriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis claimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not discriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally. Turkey  protested,   saying,  \\\"You  are  dividing   our  citizens according to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that all  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion. Therefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews.\\\" American consuls in  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told American Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they couldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were being treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book takes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the Holocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European Jews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in Palestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in Istanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other Jewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also sent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These groups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out what was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at that  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn't imagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the first step was to get information, and the Turkish government let them use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and friends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out what was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the Nazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received assistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who served as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to 1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican representative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the Catholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was doing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern Europe.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these agencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even railroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much in Poland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the Polish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for the Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the so called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through the Black Sea to Istanbul.  Turkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its borders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was suffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The government,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the non-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by the Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and Palestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean from southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly opposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did not want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they feared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British constantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic and send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government, yielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For example, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700 Jewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish government  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British ambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all were lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish government allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to pass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during the Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these refugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to send money and food out of the country.  - Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be living in Israel.  Yes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to the first group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not go  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the non-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en route to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.  - And you have rescued it from obscurity.  Many studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do not focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of the scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of whom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a much smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the picture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to undertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.  When it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively small in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The rescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so significant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were murdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.  About  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  - translations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the story is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware of  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the people of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would not  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they could see the documents.  - What languages are used in the documents?  Most of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There is a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of the boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I did not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what Turkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A few documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did not necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in fact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying to  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For example, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency was  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in helping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President Roosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had been an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York City, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The documents related to his mission are in English.  I also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust historian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His father was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had gathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn't personally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more can  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone someday will make the effort.  - This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?  Right. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the Ottoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In addition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been actively involved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the coming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I helped organize  a large international conference  on the subject which was held in Istanbul in 1992.  - Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken place, what do you plan to do next?  I'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War for Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the years  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the victorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its independence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid II, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an important modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed all sorts of political movements.  Stanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in British History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning a second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate at Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School of  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the University of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the University of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to UCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute in  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National Endowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He has  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and Bosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor for lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish studies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and Culture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in Washington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional service activities and public lectures  in both the United States and Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited volume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2 vols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or reprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983, 1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York University Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation by the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the Holocaust: Turkey's  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry from Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan Publishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.  A pamphlet summarizing the book was published in Ankara, Turkey, in 1992.  Serdar Argic\",\" Sorry, not so -- the changes in sunrise and sunset times are not quite synchronized.

The ethnic composition depends on what you mean by formed.  What the UN deeded to Israel?  What it won in war?     Were there anti-trust laws in place in mandatory Palestine? Since the answer is no, you're argument, while interestingly constructed, is irrelevant.  I will however, respond to a few points you assert in the course of talking about anti-trust laws.     And those fleeing Arab lands, where Jews were second class citizens.     Jews often paid far more than fair market value for the land they bought.    You know, Sam, when people start talking about an International Jewish conspiracy, its really begins to sound like anti-Semitic bull.   The reason there is no conspiracy here is quite simple. Zionists made no bones about what was going on.  There were conferences, publications, etc, all talking about creating a National home for the Jews.    [...]   Because you've never heard of it, its dead?  The fact is, you claimed Israel had to give arabs rights because of (non-existant) International aid.  Then you see that that argument has a hole you could drive a truck through, and again assert that Israel is only democratic within the (unexplained) constraints of one ethnic group. The problem with that argument is that Arabs are allowed to vote for whoever they please.  So, please tell me, Sam, what constraints are there on Israeli democracy that don't exist in other democratic states?   I've never heard anything about the Khazakistani arab population.  Does that mean that they have no history or roots?  When I was at Ben Gurion university in Israel, one of my neighbors was an Israeli arab.  He wasn't really all that different from my other neighbors.  Does that make him dead or oppressed?     How recent is recent?  I can probably build a case for a Jewish Gaza city.

TRANSLATION   The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self.                                    PURPORT   All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the beginning of transcendental life.   As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.  Bhagavad-Gita As It is Books of A.C.

Assuming that they are using civilians for cover, are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country? If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working?

You see, there is more to the shelling of the villages.... it is called RETALIATION... \\\"GETTING BACK\\\" ...\\\"GETTING EVEN\\\". It doesn't make sense to shell the villages.

Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. Of course, if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't make the Lebanese so mad as to do that. Furthermore, with Hezbollah  subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.   Tim, when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border? Not lately, eh?  Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use territory under their control to attack Israel. While Lebanon would be better off with Syria and Israel out of its borders, the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory (not on Israeli troops in Lebanon, however. Please note the distinction) in the past two years.   I disagree, Basil has always seemed to me to be a cool-headed person, slow to anger (certainly more so than I). What is most important is that he is an  actual witness to things from the other end of the Israeli guns.

The neo-nazi movement has a right to make speeches, say anything they want.  They do not have a right to have these speeches published by the N.Y. Times.  That depends on the Times analysis of the economic and to somewhat extent newsworthy value of those speeches.  Likewise to the sysadmin of this fellows system.  If he feels his resources are being used in a manner that is not in his best interests, or are perhaps embarassing to his organization, he will act just as the New York Times does, not to be a conduit for these ideas. The poster is after all free-loading off of someone else's pocket book when he posts.  He who controls the purse strings has the right to make the decision how he wants those funds spent or not spent.  Noone is going to put the poster in jail, unless he bombs a local building as a symbol of his hatred.  Freedom of Speech in no way equates to accessibility to conduits of information.

I'm new to this group, and maybe this has been covered already, but does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the environment being turned (unintentionally, of course) into pantheism?  I've debated this quite a bit, and while I think a legitimate concern for the planet is a great thing, I can easily see it being perverted into something dangerous.  As evidence, may I quote THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (of all things!), April 2 (Editorial page): \\\"We suspect that's because one party to the (environmental) dispute thinks the Earth is sanctified.  It's clear that much of the environmentalist energy is derived from what has been called the Religious Left, a SECULAR, or even PAGAN fanaticism that now WORSHIPS such GODS as nature and gender with a reverence formerly accorded real religions.\\\"  (EMPHASIS MINE).\",\" i'm telling you, sam, three l's.  call up mom and ask.\",\"I want to be able to send a Pixmap from one client to the next.

TIA,   John\",\" Is the license required for driving a car exclusively on private property, such as a farm? Here in the United States, the license is required only for the use of public roads.   We also have a nation of 250 million people, _many_ issues and usually only two candidates for a given office. A President might be willing to abuse mild gun control laws and create a de-facto ban (something a majority of the people would object to) and still be elected: The voters might look at issues like the civil rights of minorities, health care, etc... and vote for the \\\"lesser of two evils.\\\" I don't think this is a matter of paranoia, since local governments in (for example) New York and Chicago have abused existing, mild gun control laws to  create a virtual ban.   In which case, the United States already has adaquate gun control laws: According to federal statistic, only 7% of gun-wielding criminals legally purchase their own guns from licensed dealers. If that's the point of gun control (to prevent criminals from legally purchasing guns) then America doesn't need any additional laws to accomplish this.   How is this any different from guns? There are legal purposes for owning and using a gun: They are appropriate tools for hunting, target shooting and self-defence. Like cars, murder isn't their only (or even a common) use.   I certainly couldn't imagine the American public accepting regulation of axes. While the politics of other nations may be different, in America there is strong opposition to any intrusive law that primarily would effect the average, law-abiding citizen who had not done anything wrong.   A good way to deal with which problem? It is an excelent way to deal  with the short-term problem of rioting and violent attacks. Of course, it doesn't do anything for the long-term issues that start riots. But at this point, what can these individuals do about long-term social problems?    There are, according to surveys, guns in 40% of American homes. In many parts of the country, this is closer to 100%. Those places where almost everyone owns a gun are, on average, safer than those where guns are less common.   This is, I think, a fundamental difference between American government and that of other nations. Here it is not acceptable to punish or restrict the average, law-abiding citizen in the name of some vague \\\"common good.\\\" \",\" the fancy piggyback shocks on the 550 (and the 750, i think.  i don't know about the zr1100) are very nice, 3-way adjustability.  the forks are crappy, they dive like MAD.  i had progressive springs installed and it made a huge difference.  cheap fix, MUCH improvement.\",\"Hello, and thank you for reading this request.

Note that the film industry in California traded their political support for an \\\"assault weapon\\\" ban in the state for an amendment to the bill exempting the entertainment industry from that very ban.  Note that the very issue of the Batman comic book (\\\"Seduction of the Gun\\\") that was produced as a tool for gun-control organizations carries a back- page ad for a \\\"Terminator II\\\" video game extolling the numerous and varied sophisticated weapons available to the player.  Note that Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of the NY Times -- one of the oldest and most incessant gun-control grinders -- himself carries a concealed handgun.  Still, you find it completely incredible that these folks live by the  aphorism, \\\"Do as I say, and not as I do.\\\" -- \",\"  I'm no mustang head, but don't the early ones have a simple strut suspension (that is, with no upper A-arm)?  Just a strut going down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an A-arm), with a tension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction?   Anyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using shorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shortening the strut below the perch.  In each of these cases, the suspension geometry will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the intended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom of the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore the suspension geometry.  IMHO, the kit that includes the spacer is the only way to go...  --Ken\",\"Jeff,   I have answers to both of your questions.  First, I recommend the Sony CPD-1320 monitor.  It is a 14\\\" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed specifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video capabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci.  All it takes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is about $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of comparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for half a year and I love it.   Second, I have used Syex and found them to be decent.  I had a backorder on a Supra modem which I cancelled.  They were helpful in explaining the reasons why there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me.  The only complaint was that they did not always return my calls.   I have been told that the CPD-1320 is selling for $339 from J&R's (800)221-8180.

In fact, for the Bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use.  The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.  It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo- Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man.  This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers have done).  Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I think the important aspect is the result.  David.  --- On religion:\",\" Gulp.

Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.  Monday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.  Synopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that Randy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National Firearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.  The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently ended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither by KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.  The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley, who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person named Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms in his dealings with Randy Weaver.  Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an Aryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two then met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in time) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons transaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, \\\"He felt like he (Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the White cause.\\\"  The two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and later went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second meeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to tape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12- gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of 19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge shotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of 24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel length and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver is reported to have said that he could perform better work once his machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility of future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars for the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty dollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have simply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 - over a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).  The next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that his \\\"source\\\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead of the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver suspected he was dealing with an informant, \\\"I had a guy in Spokane tell me you were bad.\\\"  Fadeley managed to convince Weaver otherwise.  The _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were made of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these meetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also reported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki Weaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must have also been phone taps.  These tapes were played to the court via both headphones and loudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's attorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to make sure that the government proved its case, \\\"...if it has a case at all...\\\" according to the rules.  Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his wife's voice on the tape.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect this trial is not explained.  Other notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning Kevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are surprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were surprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained in the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy Weaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that Harris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report that the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming at Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics are charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the only non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and Deputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that Harris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.\",\": >And, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been traded,  : >resigned, or been striped of his title during the season?

The people of  Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never  abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally  hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole  perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July  15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop  Makarios.  Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with  the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right  given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently  and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For  those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island  since 1571.   The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct.               THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM  2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus  It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum.  AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS  The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed...  The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.  Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event.  \\\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying, in  Greek, \\\"You want Taksim eh!\\\"  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.  When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered.  In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying \\\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\\\"  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed.  An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded.  We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.  There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter.  After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport.  All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me.\\\"  ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER  We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days.  We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights.  In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner.  In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother.  In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head.  This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.  Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

Right now we  are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages. Thousands of people  abandoning homes, land, herds; Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless.

Article by Giorgo Bocca, Correspondent of Il Giorno  Date: 14 January 1964   DAILY HERALD (London)   AN APPALLING SIGHT  And when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight. Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.  In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16  wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.    DAILY TELEGRAPH (London)    GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE   Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the  Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found  crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were  brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three   more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could  not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to   locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.

Pros arrive late, nervousness for  rookie WC players, and problems to get the lines clicking may make things  hard to get it going against these \\\"worse\\\" nations.  I'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game, the better  it is, since the chances of an upset are greater then.   Some other reasons why the \\\"worse\\\" teams are so tough to beat was presented  by Hans \\\"Virus\\\" Lindberg (former coach in Switzerland).   1) The \\\"worse\\\" teams (referring to France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy etc)     have now usually world class goalies.   2) Their defensive play have become much more disciplined, they take much     less unnecessary penalties.   3) They use four lines which makes it harder to make them \\\"run out of gas.\\\"   4) The ice quality in the German WC rinks is poor.

I agree peace guarantees would be better for all, but I am addressing the problem as it stands now.  Hopefully a comprehensive peace settlement will be concluded soon, and will include security guarantees for both sides.  My proposal was aimed at decreasing the casualties in the interim period.

My suggestion is aimed at reducing the level of tension and casualties on all sides. It is unfortunate that Israel does not agree with my opinion.     That is too bad.    Because Israel is not occupying the \\\"Security Zone\\\" free of charge. It is paying the price for that.  Once Israel withdraws it may have lost a bargaining chip at the negociating table but it would save some soldiers' lives, that is my contention.    If Lebanon were willing to agree to  That is completely untrue.  Hizbollah is now a minor force in Lebanese politics.  The real heavy weights are Syria's allies.  The gov't is  supported by Syria.  The Lebanese Army is over 30,000 troops and unified like never before.  Hizbollah can have no moral justification in attacking Israel proper, especially after Israeli withdrawal. That would draw the ire of the Lebanese the Syrian and the Israeli gov'ts.  If Israel does withdraw and such an act  (Hizbolllah attacking Israel) would be akin to political and moral  suicide.

A while back, there was a thread in this group about the use of the IWII in Europe (in countries with 50 Hz AC current).  The consensus at the time was that the IWII would not work there.  As I will be moving there this summer, I called Apple to make sure and they told me (today) that the IWII (as bought in the U.S.) will definitely run on 50 Hz AC current (as long as a step-down converter is employed if 240 V current is used).

The answers I received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However, during this process I have come up with new problems.  1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic string. Is this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS or VB?  2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the DDE SQL command, (provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names) but how is one meant to update a database?    a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.    b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command from VB cannot       be used because when the macro requests information from VB using a       second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time- outs occur.       (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access to VB channel       is initiated, I guess.)    c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.      The way I eventually managed to update a database was by sending key-    strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This technique has    the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a    state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB sends.  Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect assumptions? Are there any better work arounds to the above? Are there any signs of an ODBC driver for Access?\",\" Don't be so sure.

When graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft, presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft doesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes 'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope'.   Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans, such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed taxi tests).

I think the PIrates should have spent the money on Patterson in stead.  8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.  9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke. 10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his value has increased immensely.  11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount. Let's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better. Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better than a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.  12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay. 13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace two of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a very respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have a respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options for the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was getting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.  14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave. they will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed. Now, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots, nothing else will.  On a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2 starts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the season, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked in the second half of the last 2 seasons)> \",\"Dunno about Miller.  If you mean Scott Erickson, currently the reigning Twins Least Consistent Good Player, he pulled a muscle in the neighborhood of the rib cage that made it essentially impossible for him to pitch temporarily, and is expected back on the mound Sunday.\",\"# #  \\\"Abortions destructive of the fetus must be permitted, even # #   just before birth, if they promote what the [Supreme] Court # #   calls ``health'' #  # Yes, Doug, we all know that Roe v.

Only # very stupid people (such as yourself) confuse a discussion of mental health # related to \\\"Jane Doe\\\", who was in a mental institution, and attempt to claim # that this same argument could be applied to a woman who decided she wanted # an abortion because she was having a \\\"bad hair day\\\". #  # As you well know, the facts are that there are about 100 third-trimester # abortions performed in this country annually, and those are *only* done for # *serious* health reasons. # -- # Larry Margolis, MARGOLI@YKTVMV (Bitnet), margoli@watson.IBM.com (Internet)  Hmmm.  Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That means third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consulting a 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at  21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks. Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are wrong.  By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as California, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally  stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law,  but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors, willing to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was terribly upset about this.  I remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a clinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wondering a bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice doesn't have a grain of truth to it.\",\"  And some comments, with some players deleted.   Yep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the #1 spot.  It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.    Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean. --  Dale J.

Singer brings up the Strawberry Incident, where he lost a homerun and the fan caught it.   Yes, I think he should have done more to get out of the way.  As much as fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning the game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware that this is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch it himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.  I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against  visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the field.  Now, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or not.  Sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize his first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win. \",\"  ------------ Part 10 of 14 ------------ M:J\\\"U$$,^UM[>WE/M[>V+BXN+BXN+BXN+BXOM[>U34U-34[\\\"PL!D9<7'2TM+2 M/3T]/3T]F9F9`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`$!`0&$`0%XGG5UP,#`P%M;%*JJJFMK\\\"0G/S\\\\_/SPD)-C9N MV=E&!UDS4G9V4I5960<'$=G9V=G9V=EN;FYN;FYN;F[9V=EA86%A!05L;&QL M!04%>7F3DV-CDY.3DY-C555555555555555L;&QL$A(2$A(2;&QL556TM!$1 M[NXV-C8)J@F`\\\"6L\\\";MD1$3,S4G83$W924I4S,S,S$1$163,SE5)V=G9V4@$!

Generally, these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, for example, we have the following set regarding children:   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to   the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum   [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem   families and received as servants when they are left alone through   the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect   all such children in your province and send them to the places of   deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to   the people.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [1]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the   time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their   lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.      Minister of the Interior,       Talaat\\\" [2]   \\\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.    November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the   orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their   places of exile.        Abdullahad Nuri. [3]    \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been   opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is   done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt   of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or   any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it   purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as   detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received   into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish   special orphanages for them.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat.\\\" [4]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.     Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures   to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with   the caravans.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [5]   \\\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.    At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows   of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is   not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by   Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble   in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned   out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of   deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent   away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [6]  In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \\\"rationalizing\\\" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:   \\\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for   its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks   it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I   shall die for it.\\\" [7]   These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these \\\"death march orders\\\" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.  For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.  If one were to examine the sample \\\"authentic text\\\" provided in the Turkish  Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it  too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the  Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or  Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery.   Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide  architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a  heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.  This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian.     - - - references - - -  [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60  [2] ibid, page 60  [3] ibid, page 60  [4] ibid, page 61  [5] ibid, page 61  [6] ibid, page 62  [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and     London), 1926, page 387  \",\"  I don't believe IRQ5 is the problem.

Afterwards, we sat down to discuss prices.  I explained that I wanted a car just like the one I drove, but in a different color.  He said he could get one exactly like I wanted from the dealer network within a day.  We then negotiated a price and signed the deal.  Next day, I get a call.  He explains that they goofed, and they had neglected to take into account a price increase. (The last price increase had occurred over 4 months prior to my visit.)  If I still wanted the car, I would have to fork over another $700.  As an alternative, they would honor the price if I bought the car I test drove (which had been sitting around for  6 months and had a few miles on it). I said goodbye.

The  satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section  housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof  mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The  proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation  pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered  around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.       TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The  2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a  single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be  powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).

It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal civlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967 without civil and political rights.   It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza is not a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreign country for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians are concerned and as far as common sense has it.   It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens and the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.  Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel is entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be entitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel to enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.  To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a crime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss  to which Israeli society has degraded.   I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return and live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ? Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their religion or ethnic origin ?

I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted Flakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.  Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think \\\"Oh, oh, this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.\\\"  Ten  minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.  When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even he is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when a person has a seizure.  Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you can guess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there has.  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get across what is going on here.

Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci.  Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women  poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did  not exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I  see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.    Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have  no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that  balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians  who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go  from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and  then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling  quack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a  quack.    I've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten  years now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were  raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their  farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to  entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is  about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition  either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I  know that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at  least a few \\\"enlightened\\\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really  too bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if  they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the  medical profession.  In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \\\"good\\\" bacteria after  antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not  have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \\\"good\\\" bacteria is  needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all  kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small  and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are  nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune  system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike  the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce  toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of  these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up  residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this  happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals  and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what  vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling  Elaine's doctor a quack.  Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly  called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a  yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis. Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it  requires that the host immune system be severly depressed.    Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of  normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral  course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain  much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in  it's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely  survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides  the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In  diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little  buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but  some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus  membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to  the candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on  the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \\\"treat\\\" it. If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty  nondiscript.     Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in  the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the  vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system  ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless  they broach the mucus membrane \\\"barrier\\\".  If they do, an inflammatory  response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A  from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than  they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin  A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane  barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong  inflammatory response after a candida bloom.    While diabetics can suffer from a candida \\\"bloom\\\" the  most common cause of  this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which  knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main  competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are  available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not  use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of  the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus  inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum  antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate  just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring  vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.  But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by  the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to  return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of  the problem is addressed(lack of a \\\"good\\\" bacterial flora in the body and/or  poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective  therapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving  organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not  grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is  the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum  antibiotics).    In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good  reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very  favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and  humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to  minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.    If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even  blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the  bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology  occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool  for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first  place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong  but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan  has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool  specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of  false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant  basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have  colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a  doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.  Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria  tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline  during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina.  Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal  problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of  Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of  the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina  problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year  until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting  scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had  the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some  digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she  used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex  returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic  GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his  patients is a non-existent syndrome.  The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria  which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.   If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through  aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system  needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and  some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans  are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of  the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent  disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).   Some of the above material was obtained from \\\"Natural Healing\\\" by Mark  Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human  nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in  the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely  important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in  the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida  blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate  intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI  system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out  grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and  fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check  once carbohydrate is returned to the gut.  If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post,  fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably  accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin  A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice  from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our  time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved  your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly  seeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior.    Martin Banschbach, Ph.D. Professor of Biochemistry and Chairman Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine 1111 West 17th St. Tulsa, Ok. 74107\",\"I'm attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether the proposed wiretap (or \\\"Clipper\\\") chip is a cost-effective tool for police investigation.  That is, ignoring concerns about government intrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry, and their customers, to support this wiretap technology?    A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million dollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S. wiretaps led to 2057 arrests, while total police expenditures of $28 billion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].) I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately, but I'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology.  Please send me quotable/citeable estimates for:  - How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all   phones with wiretap chips? - How much would it cost to make each chip? - How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place? - How much more would supporting hardware, people, etc. cost, per chip? - What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been   if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs? - What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed   \\\"law enforcement blocks\\\"? - What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year?  Put another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each police agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication to be wiretap compatible?  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps, or would they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes in other ways?\",\"Archive-name: rec-autos/part5  [this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast, and so is not crossposted to misc.consumers.  -- rpw]     [changes as of 14 April 1993: revised brake fluid section, as     non-silicone DOT-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw]                   Commonly Asked Automotive Questions   Tire Questions:  Q:  What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean?  A:  Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14.  the 195 is the     overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually     narrower.  The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the     sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire     has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel     diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'     tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like     390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed     rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly     inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common     speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to     150MPH.)      Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed     rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find     designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load     associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous     operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is     a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum     per-tire loads:      Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157     Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125      Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.      In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire     size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation     indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application     of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters     only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of     interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For     the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference     between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at     all.      If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.      Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating     reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)      There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,     traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded     A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is     a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they     are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are     thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.  Q:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put     normal tires on the car?  A:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.     Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible     with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them     so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that     more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)     You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your     car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly     dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,     or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard     to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear     has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.  Q:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side     of my car?  A:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many     say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a     car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others     (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping     is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before     rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.  Q:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the     car should I put them on?  A:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't     get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow     conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there     are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear     wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car     going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car     (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,     stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the     snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes     while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.  Radar Detectors and Speed Limits:  Q:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits     in this Q&A posting?  A:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between     misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless     flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please     subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.  Safety Equipment:  Q:  Do airbags really work?  A:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much     better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than     Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than     3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend     to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the     explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but     not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention     of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.  Brake Questions:  Q:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas     always wants to do this.  A:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing     rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors     more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped     warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or     to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas     are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical     to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,     or badly grooved.  Q:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is     this really a good idea?  A:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade     prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of     downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases     of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more     than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they     are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.      On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA     still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I     suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to     do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a     car with an automatic to take the test.  Q:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?  A:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to     absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake     system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type     are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The     principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry     boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling     point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest     wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better     boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling     point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see     the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that     DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific     cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly     competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_     improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for     DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out     fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid     out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.  Q:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?  A:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks     excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone     based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and     DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound     like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in     such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any     metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend     to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where     most of the corrosion occurs.      Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to     Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly     beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the     brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.      Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are     difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which     interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they     generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they     do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable     in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense     in some street car applications, but they are certainly not     recommended for high performance driving applications, and the     economics are questionable for street use.      I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard     that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably     compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little     information at this time.  Q:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs     more.  Is it worth it?  A:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will     be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer     is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally     work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does     not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),     and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques     like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.      Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the     car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able     be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several     systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is     what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence     of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed     sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and     may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original     equipment or OE-equivalent components.      When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking     the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the     system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS     will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a     sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could     sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is     achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as     the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are     truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system     this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this     duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;     on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform     threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on     snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes     locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,     has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this     eventuality.      A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves     steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are     braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release     the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off     on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.     Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.      An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical     braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on     glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.     The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an     ABS system in your car.      As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential     restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the     following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder     for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master     cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for     over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5     (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of     the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system     components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid     becomes very important.  Q:  What about this threshold braking business?  A:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent     publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers     in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is     needed here -- rpw]      Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high     performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab     the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much     to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate     maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but     just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold     brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn     to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake     pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the     threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.     In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're     not very near the threshold.      In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just     before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on     the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very     close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better     stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS     take over.      Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of     accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with     ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed     the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now     seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the     involved officers had any recent performance driving training.     There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing     brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique     of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to     try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you     think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must     cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least     1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that     much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.     Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective     and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if     you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at     the pedal will be sufficient.      Gas Questions:  Q:  Does High Octane gasoline help?  A:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the     engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.     On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your     car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car     needs.  Q:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?  A:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,     although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase     in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded     gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,     check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not     actually require leaded gasoline.  Q:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?  A:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use     dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.     Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl     Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs     and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.      Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes     called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's     manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider     10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol     (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected     cars.      An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with     fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that     do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain     Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything     in your gas tank.      There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are     noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work     much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,     Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,     once every six months, is highly recommended.  Q:  What about detergent gasolines?  A:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW     has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this     test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test     are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such     gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.     Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean     engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.  Lubrication Questions:  Q:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?  A:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter     code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer      uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are     for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine     applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels     of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,     SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.      The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either     a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by     the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly     used these days, and are the only type that most automobile     manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the     designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;     the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity     of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually     get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What     is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity     of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast     as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the     viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.      Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not     all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all     30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the     novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has     been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils     do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,     15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.  Q:  Are `quick lube' places any good?  A:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out     there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure     that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on     your wallet at all times.  Q:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?  A:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have     come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based     additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the     chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,     auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET     responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight     increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term     results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are     debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the     product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes     deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners     have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of     Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50     Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as     it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are     no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.      On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.  Q:  Do synthetic oils really work?  A:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,     but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by     oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to     change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your     car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change     the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty     as conventional oils.      Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter     entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very     effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.  Q:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.     How often should I change my oil?  A:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)     gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs     down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,     you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you     only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up     to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,     perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are     now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car     much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change     oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,     then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out     of storage.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they     break.  What's the story?  A:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,     for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but     the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.     Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.      If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the     belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent     replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if     there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time     (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have     a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,     destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage     as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water     pump can be a costly mistake.)  Q:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it     self destructs when the timing belt breaks?  A:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the     valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression     ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are     more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance     oriented vehicles.  Q:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?  A:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety     Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be     caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the     same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report     goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator     is probably the cause.\",\" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      Just a random passing thought, but can anyone cite a documented use of encryption technology by criminals and terrorists.

Also: come on, Brad. If we are going to get anywhere in  this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never  addressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is  \\\"right\\\" or who is \\\"wrong\\\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover  and that, having been placed \\\"in between\\\" the Israelis and the guerillas, they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.    [The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms   is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that   civilians will not be thought of by the other side as  \\\"combatants\\\". So, what do you think is the \\\"meaning behind\\\",   the intention and the effect when an \\\"army\\\" purposely   *does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look   like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will   receive from this \\\"cover\\\" is more important that the harm  that will come to civilians.*  This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians in \\\"the middle\\\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians.   But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves  at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \\\"why set   ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made   cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of   view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept   some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.   I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND ineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait  until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that \\\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\\\" will do more to stop attacks.   As I said previously, Israel spent several decades \\\"sitting passively\\\" on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after* the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well. The \\\"host\\\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks  from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact  on the civilians caught in their path.    This is just another \\\"selectively applied\\\" statement.   The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.  That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for  the \\\"interim\\\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are demanding conditions that essentially define \\\"autonomy\\\" already. They DO NOT trust that Israel will \\\"follow through\\\" the entire process and allow Palestinians to reach full autonomy.   Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians?  If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians  be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words? Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up \\\"tangible assets  (land, control of areas) in exchange for \\\"words\\\". For this reason, they are also concerned about the sorts of \\\"guarantees\\\" they will have  that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.  Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the Israelis \\\"word\\\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being demanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party finally gets HOLD of this \\\"land\\\", what the \\\"other party\\\" does is totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land, your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to keeps its word does NOT get the land back.   While the \\\"major armaments\\\" (those allowing people to wage \\\"civil wars\\\") have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still remain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \\\"commando\\\" raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.   Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks were commonplace.   There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \\\"disarmed\\\" UNLESS the state is as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.  That's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to \\\"take over\\\" Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that. What both \\\"sides\\\" need is to receive something \\\"tangible\\\". The Arabs/ Palestinians are looking for \\\"land\\\" and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it gives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks\",\"    Rather than decide which book you want to buy, you need to decide which programming interface you want to use, then buy the appropriate book.  I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences between PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out pretty soon).  But here's a brief summary...  PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many devices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take advantage of a 3D extension to X called \\\"PEX\\\".  PEXlib is a slightly \\\"lower\\\" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX extension to X.  Some advantages of using PEXlib... - Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS - Provides immediate mode capabilities - Is free of \\\"policy\\\" - PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support   features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).   PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.  Some advantages of using PHIGS... - Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones - Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output - PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier - PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you - PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.  If you're working strictly in X and don't care about things like archiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find that both API's have a lot in common.\",\" I think VW got caught out on the airbag thing.  It's only been in the last year or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature. VW assumed that  automatic belts would satisfy govt. requirements for passive restraint, but didn't guess that the 'merican consumer would actually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag.  VW is really hurting right now in the US market.  Check out the article in last week's Autoweek about the crisis at VW.  Golfs and Jettas will be coming from the plant in Mexico, but they don't have the quality at that facility.  As per normal VW practice, the US launch of the Jetta III is delayed again and again, until a good chunk of the useful life of the design is spent.  I think that Passats come from Germany, so there is not the same quality and availability issue.  It's a nice car with a nice engine. Whether VW will be a player in the US market in two year's time is a different question...\",\"In-Reply-To: <20APR199312262902@rigel.tamu.edu> lmp8913@rigel.tamu.edu (PRESTON, LISA M)\",\"    Good comeback, Rog.

If the system is really secure, then why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?  There are plenty of encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure, so why in the world use one that does?  There are reasons, of course, but I certainly can't think of any honest ones.  Next, you assume we can \\\"trust\\\" the escrow houses. But the last time I checked, EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure, corruption, and even fabrication, of supposedly secure data. The govt is saying \\\"Yeah, but NOW we're serious, so you can trust us.\\\"  Bullcrypt.   And finally, although you didn't state it explicitly, you implicitly assume that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. The case in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this score.  Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers, right?  As others have pointed out, the current proposal will, if deployed, render truly secure encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sam's brand. Who will be able to afford, and be sufficiently motivated, to purchase this expensive, inconvenient higher protection?  Somebody with lots of extra cash...

Points covered here are ones which are not covered in the \\\"Introduction to Atheism\\\"; you are advised to read that article as well before posting.  These answers are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive. The purpose of the periodic FAQ postings is not to stifle debate, but to raise its level. If you have something to say concerning one of these questions and which isn't covered by the answer given, please feel free to make your point.  Overview of contents:     \\\"What is the purpose of this newsgroup?\\\"    \\\"Hitler was an atheist!\\\"    \\\"The Bible proves it\\\"    \\\"Pascal's Wager\\\"    \\\"What is Occam's Razor?\\\"    \\\"Why it's good to believe in Jesus\\\"    \\\"Why I know that God exists\\\"    \\\"Einstein and \\\"God does not play dice\\\"\\\"    \\\"Everyone worships something\\\"    \\\"Why there must be a causeless cause\\\"    \\\"The universe is so complex it must have been designed\\\"    \\\"Independent evidence that the Bible is true\\\"    \\\"Godel's Incompleteness Theorem\\\"    \\\"George Bush on atheism and patriotism\\\"    \\\"I know where hell is!\\\"    \\\"Biblical contradictions wanted\\\"    \\\"The USA is a Christian nation\\\"    \\\"The USA is not a Christian nation\\\"  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Subject: What is the purpose of this newsgroup?  Typical posting:  Why have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups?   What is there to discuss?  Response:  Many things are discussed here, including:  * Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's   family * Prayer in schools * Discrimination against atheists * Sunday trading laws * The Satanic Child Abuse myth * Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet' * How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students * How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers * Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual * Why people become atheists  Of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians looking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't  want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure  from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.  ------------------------------  Subject: Hitler was an atheist!  Typical posting:  Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!  Response:  Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:     The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in    his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_    superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_    not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]     For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their    abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the    Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be    active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every    man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who    in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his    religious community and tries to butt into the other.     [...]     Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will    of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_    fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]            -- Adolf Hitler, from \\\"Mein Kampf\\\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.  Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed  to believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist,  though.  ------------------------------  Subject: The Bible proves it  Typical posting:  In the Bible it says that...  Response:  Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed 'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The Bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted.  Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to \\\"interpretation\\\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and one thing only is not legitimate.  Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.  It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: Pascal's Wager  Typical posting:  If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing -- but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.  Response:  This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.  Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often described as the \\\"avoiding the wrong hell\\\" problem.  If a person is a follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.  Secondly, the statement that \\\"If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing\\\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness. Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer.  Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that  the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of  comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God  is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.  Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on  evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or  cost-benefit analysis.  Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:    1. One does not know whether God exists.   2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does      exist.   3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.   4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.  There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at no \\\"cost\\\".  The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The argument thus collapses to \\\"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests to believe in God\\\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal intended the argument to be viewed.  The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him.  ------------------------------  Subject: What is Occam's Razor?  Typical posting:  People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?  Response:  William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's  Razor.  In its original form, it said \\\"Do not multiply entities  unnecessarily.\\\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity, then do so.  Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it  more generally, for example as \\\"Take the simplest solution\\\".  The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations  for what we see around us:  1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which came into being as a result of natural processes.  2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and  there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be  of non-zero complexity.  Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest  that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one. Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:  3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.   We just imagine that there is.  This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people  find unacceptable.   ------------------------------  Subject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus  Typical posting:  I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.  Response:  Preaching is not appreciated.  Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that are on a \\\"conversion\\\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup talk.religion.misc).  You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would have them do unto you!  Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy analogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it, since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why I know that God exists  Typical posting:  I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.  Response:  Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist.  That evidence varies from person to person.  Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been abducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.  ------------------------------  Subject: Einstein and \\\"God does not play dice\\\"  Typical posting:  Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?  Response:  Einstein did once comment that \\\"God does not play dice [with the universe]\\\".  This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the Christian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore, Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.  A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following: \\\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.\\\"  Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that QM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found, and much evidence suggests that it never will be.  A longer quote from Einstein appears in \\\"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A Symposium\\\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In    \\\"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events    the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side    of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him    neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an    independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a    personal God interfering with natural events could never be    *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this    doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific    knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.     But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives    of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine    which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,    will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm    to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers    of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal    God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past    placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they    will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable    of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity    itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably    more worthy task...\\\"     \\\"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,    a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a    personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.    If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the    unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our    science can reveal it.\\\"  The latter quote is from \\\"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\\\", edited by Helen  Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.   Also from the same book:    \\\"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics    to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind     it.\\\"  Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does  not in itself imply that Christianity is false.  ------------------------------  Subject: Everyone worships something  Typical posting:  Everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.  Response:  If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why there must be a causeless cause  Typical posting:  Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.  Response:  The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has no smallest member.  Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed  Typical posting:  The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you don't think all this appeared here just by chance?  Response:  This is known as the Argument From Design.  It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while.  There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here. However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence, observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth.  The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some  external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately.  But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position.  This leads us to the familiar theme of \\\"If a creator created the universe, what created the creator?\\\", but with the addition of spiralling  improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just \\\"is\\\" (or \\\"was\\\").  From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just \\\"is\\\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book \\\"A Brief History of Time\\\", explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.  The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called  Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it evolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the  watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the  universe too must have a creator.  The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above  those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates  watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have  created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are  clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.  Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in  the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear  reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument  would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a  different part of creation.  Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that  the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore  stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the  argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not  random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus  internally inconsistent.  ------------------------------  Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true  Typical posting:  The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence.  For example...  Response:  The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence.  Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or James; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but that this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \\\"reconstructions\\\" of the original text have been published to this effect.  Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320 C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material.  Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is more well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.  ------------------------------  Subject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem  Typical posting:  Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the Bible to be both true and complete.  Response:  Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal  system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary  arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be  valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal  system.)  Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \\\"Liar  Paradox.\\\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \\\"This  sentence is false.\\\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal  system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.  The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.  One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom.  This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.  It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists within the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.  Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.  Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be both consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal systems, so such claims are nonsense.  ------------------------------  Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism  Typical posting:  Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?  Response:  The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I. Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the presidential primary:   RS: \\\"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in       God is important to me.\\\"   RS: \\\"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of       Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,       nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under       God.\\\"   RS: \\\"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation       of state and church?\\\"   GB: \\\"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not       very high on atheists.\\\"  UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks.  The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27, 1989.  It can also be found in \\\"Free Enquiry\\\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue, Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.  On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane, cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School District 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \\\"one nation under God\\\" (Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:    RS: \\\"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.       Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\\\"    EM: \\\"It's bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"What is bullshit?\\\"    EM: \\\"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush       campaign is on this issue.\\\"   EM: \\\"You're welcome.\\\"  After Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract his statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the President, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by    \\\"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports    atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or    supported by the government.\\\"  For further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American Atheist Press's Cameron Road address.  ------------------------------  Subject: I know where hell is!  Typical posting:  I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!  Response:  There are several towns called \\\"Hell\\\" in various countries around the world, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now  getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.  ------------------------------  Subject: Biblical contradictions wanted  Typical posting:  Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?  Response:   American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical contradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for details.  There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the archive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the United States be considered a Christian nation?  Response:  Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some quotes; there are many more.    \\\"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?    In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the    ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen    upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been    the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert    the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient    auxiliaries.

Response:  No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):     Article 11     As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense    founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of    enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as    the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility    against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no    pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption    of the harmony existing between the two countries.  The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections such as Charles Bevans' \\\"Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776-1949\\\", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).  The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on June 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.  The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul General at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of Christianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there is no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.  In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation. \",\"I've seen PGP 2.2 mentioned for the Mac platform. I use 2.0 on MS/DOS. Is there a 2.2 for MS/DOS?

Completely smooth.  Not that it runs poorly normally, but on these days, it is exceptional.  My theory is that the air density and moisture content of the air are such that I get complete combustion.  Needless to say, it puts me in a great mood.  The mood lasted for about 20 miles.  Heading north on the 405 freeway, about a mile or two south of the 10, my throttle stopped responding.... and I was between lanes.  Nothing to do but make  my way over 4 lanes to the shoulder... initially by gliding, then by pushing.  At least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did not mind stopping for me.  Turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS40  carb.  I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws tight on a bike, but I never thought that I had to do that on the screws inside of a carb.  At least it was roadside fixable and I was on my way in hardly any time. ____________________________________________________________________________    Death is life's way of telling you you've been fired  -- R.

Put it at a convenient number like \\\"1\\\".  You *could* cut a hole in the back of the machine to route the ID switch, but why go through the hassle?  You probably won't be needing to frequently change the ID of your internal drive.   Yeah, when I first installed the tape drive I was a little concerned too.  But it's no problem, the device is designed to fit just fine with the overhang.  It shouldn't reach back beyond the ROM/RAM/VRAM SIMMs, though.   You can special-order parts to mount the device from your local Apple dealer.  The relevant parts are:    922-0358  blank bezel faceplate   922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25\\\" device mounting bracket]  Note Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to mount a 5.25\\\" device.  The service techs I talked to said, \\\"Oh sure, we stock those.\\\"  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to hold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.  As far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already cut out for a standard 5.25\\\" device.  (Why not?  They advertise these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the 5.25\\\" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for their CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.  I'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my tape drive, which is a standard 5.25\\\" device.

Are you sure about this? I'm currently looking at a copy of last  Thursday's SF Chronicle and there is the typical one column Traders ad on page C7 in the Sports section. Not only that, but there is a part in the middle which rather prominently says \\\"WANTED: We pay cash for assault rifles and pistols.\\\". Granted, I haven't seen today's paper yet. But I'd be surprised if there wasn't a Traders ad in it. It's probably worth it to write to the Chronicle (and other papers) anyway, because all their anti-gun editorials are disgusting.

The main problems we encountered were:   1) Clients written with logic like the following:       if (DefaultDepth() != 1)   /* Assume default depth is 8bit */      These clients need an 8bit deep visual in the root window     to run correctly.   2) Other clients didn't even bother to do that much, and just     outright assumed they had a *dynamic* visual class, with a     dynamic colormap. XStoreColors doesn't work on cmaps     associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes, but     many clients don't bother to check, they just start     throwing XStoreColor calls at you.  Though both are clearly client error, this is the case with so many clients that it's easier for you to expose 8bit PseudoColor as a default root window visual, than it ever would be for all these client writers to change their clients to do the right thing. --\",\"84 Mazda Pickup Rebuilt engine at 60,000 miles.

The blast is believed to be the work of a suicide bomber. Radio reports said a car packed with butane gas exploded between two parked buses, one belonging to the IDF and the other civilian. Both busses went up in flames. The blast killed an Arab man who worked at a nearby snack bar in the Mehola settlement. An Israel Radio report stated that the other man who was killed may have been the one who set off the bomb. According to officials at the Haemek Hospital in Afula, the eight IDF soldiers injured in the blast suffered light to moderate injuries.

MONTREAL\",\"      Yes, quite a number of people it seems from discussions I've had (me included). I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and started to experience these problems.  Apple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of potential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware (modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power manager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.  None of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe (no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I have no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears to help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on startup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is being corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any non-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be reset by \\\"holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up\\\" - Apple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button I'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if someone can decipher Apple's advice for me.  Beyond this Apple suggest that \\\" you should follow the technical procedures to check the hardware of this Duo\\\". Since so many others appear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there has been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line - and quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230 purchasers who have this problem.  Any more comments from others in the same boat are welcome, particularly Apple Duo engineers :-)  cheers  brucet \",\" Sorry folks, I should have done this, and meant to just after i hit the  send key...

There is explicitly NO WARRANTY that the given settings are correct or harmless. (I only collect, I do not check for myself!!!). There is always the possibility that the settings may destroy your hardware! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Since I hope however that only well-minded people undergo the effort of posting their settings the chance of applicability exists. If you should agree or disagree with some setting, let me know immediately in order to update the list.  If you possess a HD not mentioned here of which you know BIOS and/or jumper settings, please mail them to me for the next update of the list!  Only IDE (AT-Bus) Harddisks will be accounted for. If not specified the Landing Zone should be set equal to the number of cylinders. If not specified the 'Write Precompensation' should be set 65535. (There are BIOSes that don't even ask for it).  Another statement (maybe right): IDE harddisk don't have Precomp and LZone. The precomp is a built-in parameter and lzone isn't used because most if not every IDE disk has autopark.  The jumpers' names are given as printed on the HD's board, often only a jumper number (JP12 means the jumper '12'). A zero means that the jumper is left open, a one means that the jumper is closed.    ***************************   C O N N E R   ***************************     Conner Peripherals Drive Geometry  IDE/AT  Conner drives are low level formatted at the factory.

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master.    In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives  when performing diagnostics.    There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way  interface connector. They have the following functions and are described  in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper  described nearest the 40 way interface connector.  LK2: LED       When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the      interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An      external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with      the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will      be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130      Ohms ot 220 Ohms.  LK1: Dual Drives      This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single      bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,      indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.  LK4: Master      When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If      there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be      jumpered in this way.  LK5: IOChRdy      When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is       fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher      data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per      second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally       fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per      second.     There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s) may be jumpered:       Master, single drive with LED on interface  LK2 & LK4 fitted.      Master, single drive without LED on interface LK4 only fitted.      Master, dual drive without LED on interface LK4 & LK1 fitted.      Slave, dual drive without LED on interface  No jumpers fitted.      Master, dual drive with LED on interface  LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.      Slave, dual drive with LED on interface  LK2 only fitted.     The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.     The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way  connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the  drive for this LED driver.

The magnitude of such accelerations he estimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not be a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published in 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very long-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in fact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of course. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration? Can this be extended to larger accelerations?\",\"I am getting Garbled output when serial printing thru Windows & works etc.  This has occurred on several systems and goes if a LaserJet 4 is used.

I'm sure its not JUST me with this problem.  Thanks for reading....  John Atherton       \",\" A professor of mine once said \\\"The difference between a Computer Engineer and a Computer Scientist is about $5000\\\" meaning the Engineer makes $5000 more than the CS. Seriously though the main difference is that most CS people write programs that people will use, i.e. database, graphics, word processors, etc., while an engineer writes for machines or control systems, i.e. the \\\"computer\\\" in your car, a flight control system, computer controled devices, etc. In other words CS writes SOFTWARE while CSE writes FIRMWARE.  These are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is.\",\" I don't want to get into a semantic argument, but contrary to some other postings \\\"near UV light\\\" /is/ \\\"actual UV light.\\\"  The \\\"near\\\" means that it is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength), not that it is \\\"nearly UV.\\\"  (I'm sure you can figure out now just what \\\"far UV\\\" is.)  Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the visible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.  It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to be useful, but not dangerously so.\",\" Actually, Messier was invited, but declined due to nagging injuries...

If they blast away a few good fokes then that is : :With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with :mega fire power. They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few  I hope this is a joke... if not, here's my response:  The BATF has a history of no-knock raids with poor evidence, often resulting in innocent people being killed or suffering injury to person or property.  I will NOT support the BATF until they clean up their act... Maybe...  As to equipment, the BATF has damn near anything it wants...  Their faults were in intelligence (military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during DAYLIGHT??), methodology (the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assault a position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting negotiations first), and legality.  The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms and tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They have very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the child-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco issues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with no violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, then the FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agent in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence, murder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the  public what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault on American citizens.  And while on the issue of investigating this issue, the Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated for BATF wrongdoing.

The moderator of the firearms-politics mailing list, Karl Kleinpaste, has agreed to set up an anonymous ftp archive directory for RKBA related information.  This directory can be used for things like articles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions, the RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It's not meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.  So, in the future if you're looking for something check there first and then ask here.  Instructions:  Short version for techies:  The site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the directory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands get, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command \\\"type binary\\\" to be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved to the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.  I will maintain an index which you should get first to check if the file you want to read or write already is archived.  Long version for non-techies:  In order for you to use this archive your computer must be on the Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:   ftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu  If that doesn't work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp command is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a login:  Name (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):  Instead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:   ftp  Next you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:   Guest login ok, send e-mail address as password:  I would enter:   l.v.cipriani@att.com  You'll enter your own e-mail address.  You'll get these lines or similar as output:   Remote system is UNIX.  Using binary mode to transfer files.  Next, the command prompt is printed:   ftp>   If you do not get the line \\\"Using binary mode to transfer files.\\\" Run the command:   type binary  Now you're logged in to the archive machine.  There are many directories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are   /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba and  /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming  There are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.  When you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:   cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba or  cd pub/firearms/politics/rkba  To submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with the command:   cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming or  cd pub/firearms/politics/incoming  Once you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter another command.  To find the names of the existing files in the directory you are in run the command:   ls -l  This will produce something like:  total 6021 -r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP -r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX -r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies -r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361 -r--r--r--  1 karl          8958 Jun 16  1992 WSJ_Crimestrike -r--r--r--  1 karl          2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias -r--r--r--  1 karl           935 Mar 22 22:38 academics -r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu ... and so on ...  Each line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields are the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of the file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need to be concerned with.  To get a file run the command \\\"get\\\" followed by the name of the file you want, for example:   get INDEX or  get noduty  After the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:   Transfer complete.  19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)  You can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive. You can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the file you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025 you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it:   cd congress/103rd  get HR1025  Once you're finished you can log off with the command:   quit  If you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little different.  First of all you should find out if the file already exists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  The index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba directory.  For example:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- File: whitemanslaw  White Man's Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985 Reason magazine ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Once you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login and change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once you are in the incoming directory use the command:   put file_name  In this case:   put whitemanslaw  Again there'll be a \\\"Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered in so many seconds\\\" message.  Now your file is on the archive machine.  Another thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure there isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same as the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'll overwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message].  Your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory.  Once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for the INDEX file and I will add it to the file.  If you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and I'll take care of the rest.  If you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so be sure to let me know first.  If you have any questions feel free to ask me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --  Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com     \",\" The Orion concept as actually proposed (as opposed to the way it has been somewhat misrepresented in some fiction) included wrapping a thick layer of reaction mass -- probably plastic of some sort -- around each bomb.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability      of these products.         \",\"Can someone send me ticket ordering information for the following teams:  Baltimore, Philadelphia and Boston.

It was largely the mainstream Christian's disgust #at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred.  True, but that is exactly the \\\"problem\\\": the Mormon extermination order was issued not just by a Christian, it was ALLOWED under the Constitution of the United States, which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents like this \\\"order\\\" from occurring in the first place...  As I indicated in an earlier posting, your \\\"irrational hatred\\\" is clearly evidenced by individuals like Robert Weiss (who could have been Gov. Boggs' Lieutenant; he would have fitted right in, drewling et al), and seems a modern-day occurrence, based on results (slander, persecution, misrepresentation, lies, denying Mormons representation in their own user group, etc. etc.  In intent and purpose, what really has changed?  #The situation is not entirely different today.  Many irrational feelings #and beliefs are justified through religion.  I don't think most of them #are started because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and #perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification #which discourages critical thought.

It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you #badly must have been done primarily for that purpose.  What I mean is that secular authorities are to be watched, as we believe that Satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert truth, judgment, and justice.  In addition, we believe that the adversary has power to influence the unjust and idolatrous (greed for money would be a good example) in order to bring about persecution, war, oppression, and evil combinations.  As an intelligent being, don't you suppose that the destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power?

No.  Computer speed is only partly dependent of processor/clock speed. Memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and I/O speed.  As processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed.  If you have a 50MHz processor, it can be reading another word from memory every 20ns.  Sure, you can put all 20ns memory in your computer, but it will cost 10 times as much as the slower 80ns SIMMs.  And roughly, the 68040 is twice as fast at a given clock speed as is the 68030. \",\" Did your boyfriend comment on the fact that Clement looks like a walking ad for Brillo pad hair replacement therapy?

Mitchell                           March 23, 1993   INTRODUCTION:   In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment purposes. Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of a lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in Twenty-First century remote learning methods.   Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures, interfacing and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at the LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real facility exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves.   This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:  - tele-operations and virtual reality research  - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation  - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers  - art and theater  - bbs and online network users  - software and game developers  - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains  - children  - the child in all of us   LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:   A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth. The \\\"floor\\\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and machine-lets.    The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:  1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;  2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and  3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.    Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on  it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture  content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent  to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.   The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to LTM1.   Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the SSTO to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar landscape and land.   Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.   By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours.   PLAN OF ACTION:   The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network. Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \\\"rail stock\\\" for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets. An initial \\\"ground breaking\\\" with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution world-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony.   A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return to their campus.   A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media. Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community. Especially since the \\\"action\\\" will be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be invited to issue \\\"challenges\\\" to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.   The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education, experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a long term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!   CONCLUSION:   EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create world-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require real (not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in space.

How should I do it? A: You would be wise not to copyprotect that program.  You see, those     people that wants to get a cracked copy of your program will go to     various length to crack your program, and some of those crackers     are good, and know the common tricks.    So, the copy protection wouldn't stop those.    Ok, then.  What about legitimate users?  Copy protection can be a hassle    for legitimate users, and can hinder them in their work, expecially    if there is some \\\"key\\\" item that can get lost.    So, the copy protection wouldn't help much of the legitimate users, but    would make life somewhat of a misery for them.

Friday, May 7, 1993 Hyatt Regency - Crystal City Hotel Arlington, VA  ABOUT THE CONFERENCE The Low-Cost Lunar Access conference will be a forum for the exchange of ideas on how to initiate and structure an affordable human lunar program. Inherent in such low-cost programs is the principle that they be  implemented rapidly and meet their objectives within a short time frame.  [more deleted]  CONFERENCE PROGRAM (Preliminary)  In the Washington Room:    9:00 - 9:10 a.m.     Opening Remarks     Dr. Alan M. Lovelace    9:10 - 9:30 a.m.     Keynote Address     Mr. Brian Dailey    9:30 - 10:00 a.m.    U.S. Policy Outlook     John Pike, American Federation of Scientists    A discussion of the prospects for the introduction of a new low-cost   lunar initiative in view of the uncertain direction the space   program is taking.    10:00 - 12:00 noon   Morning Plenary Sessions    Presentations on architectures, systems, and operational concepts.   Emphasis will be on mission approaches that produce significant   advancements beyond Apollo yet are judged to be affordable in the   present era of severely constrained budgets   In the Potomac Room    12:00 - 1:30 p.m.    Lunch     Guest Speaker: Mr. John W.

Too bad I can't go.\",\"    Humanist, or sub-humanist? :-)\",\"...   It's amazing how everyone automatically blames one side or the other.  One thing for sure:  Koresh will have no chance to defend himself  against the statements (lacking in fact or COurt sponsored verification)  made  by agents who participated in the situation that killed him.    I don't know they murdered him; I also don't know   that the Branch Davidians set a fire and suicidede.    It is SICK of BATF or FBI spokepeople to make such   comments in advance of forensic pathology.   Stephen:  thank you.  God speed.      Yah.    BINGO.  Am I the only one  to notice:  a) No peaceful attempt to serve a warrant.  b) Six months to develop a scene and six days to end it?  c) .... ah God:     25 children    at least 64 adults    plus 6 at the beginning    and more BATF agents     all dead.    Has anyone asked themselves these questions:   1)  Have you seen the ENTIRE video sequences taken during the    opening rounds?  I seem to recall missing several key parts:   a)  The first five minutes of day one; only the shooting     part comes out.   b)  What happened to the Feds video units?  You mean they do     not carry helmet cams?  Wonder why not?  2)   How is it you can have camera crews with live transmission    video present and NOT have an uninterrupted record?    a)  You realize the units carry ittle bitty 8mm backups?    That hold 90 minutes per unit?  And there are    twounits on the professional handhelds (so no    tape turnover gaps)?   b)  Until all views are seen, it is premature to point    fingers in either direction.   As you well point out, Stephen.    More on this below.    Yes.  But it is so hard toremain human under the full  pressure of hazard, game playing, and life.    More to the point:  when someone dies (almost like it was intended  that way), both sides will kill to maintain their innocence --   a contradiction in terms.    True.  Usually I pick the unpopular side and point out  from the evidence seen what might have alternatively happened.    This requires someone interested in God's Will.  Please note  that the outstanding _overt_ problem in this country today  is one where the Government:    wants Caesar's coin to pay off the debt.    Yes:  The AMerican People.  Not the Federal Government.  ANd if it is not spent towards that end, _no_one_ deserves  the coin.     Yah.  Fewpeople hear the contradiction:    Money   made   in the image   of God    I wish you were wrong.  Many pundits are saying 3 years.  The onyl good thing to come out of my divorce (and my  exposure to the Damned (pardon me) American Divorce Attorney  is:    I have no money left to lose to taxes or inflation.    25 children dead.  If anyone thinks blaming Koresh -- or the BATF  helps this any at all, is sick.  and wrong.    The reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely   straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences   havew made ANY comments about even the POSSIBILITY that   Koresh or his followers caused this.    The BATF agentss are more concerned with their repuations   and morals (\\\"not my fault, Koresh did it!\\\") than they   are with:     25 dead children.   Same goes for Koresh & his followers - who are all (mostly) dead.    More on power and favoritism.  (My personal opinion).   Look to history:  whenever privilege has replaced whatever  token of objective law and justice a society has had,    Hitlerrs have followed.    You do your name sake proud, Stephen.  Its hard, but please keep on keeping on:   each voice in the wilderness now will   save a generation unborn from horror    The day I _need_ a gun or abomb to protect myself in this  society is the day that society is already beyond redemption    and that aint' redundant, if you have any Christian   belief aytall.   ... and the day that I cannot peacefully enjoin others in the  act that Thoreau called Civil Disobedience to rectify the  wrongs that my society practises, without undue harm or  punishment befalling me, is the day that society has ceased to  be a human society, and become a society of animals.    We are _very_ cclose to that.    Six years fighting an unjust COurt issue:  still struggling to be  patient.  For those who like contrary questions:   NB:  I was not there.  I am not a Branch Davidian nor a     law  official hater.  I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same.  The official side has its advocates already; lets balance the  equation and asj a few questions on the other side, for the sake  of an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass:    innocent until proven guilty.  not   innocent until presumed guilty.   1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.    Don't tell me they do not exist.  They are standard   equipment.   2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?    a)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This     aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable     as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.     .... gotcha!      ... when in isolation from other substances.      WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote     launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce \\\"this window,     blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come     down\\\", and maintain a left to right sequence?    b)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when     mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)     suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to     brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long     exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend     to ignite.     What other chemicals come up in the forensics?    Who else will be allowed to test the site?    c)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation     rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made     to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature     above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain     heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length     of time (start a wall fire and wait).     Check your military records; look at the tapes.    Why were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),    tear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why    the hurry. was there still a comm channel open    to the outside?).     Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the    compound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones    are missing?   Do I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.  You trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?   IN advance of a Court?  God help us.    (For we are surely not helping ourselves).  You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?    You are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.   Look again.   Did it happen that way?  I do not know.  I was not there.   AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE.  But will that happen?  89 people will NOT have the chance   to tell their side as the BATF leader was, on camera.  No one wins.  Except:  more force next time.   Listen to your hearts, people.

Yet again, the use of this newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge of.  For cites on MSG, look up almost anything by John W. Olney, a toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on development.  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an excitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamate is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain (humans included).  Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown off.  Glutamate and aspartate, also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts, and are freely available in many foods, but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food.  By eating lots of junk food, packaged soups, and diet soft drinks, it is possible to jack your blood levels so high, that anyone with a sensitivity to these compounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects.  Read Olney's review paper in Prog. Brain Res, 1988, and check *his* sources. They are impecable. There is no dispute.\",\"   Thanks again.  One final question.

Strangely, even when I have smartdrive installed, every DIR command accesses the disk.  Did I somehow de-activate the cache?

The cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military  in communications, intelligence gathering and firepower.   In a similar vein, the amount of marijuana smuggled into  this country has greatly decreased. This is because its  value-per-pound is very low when compared to cocaine or  heroin. It's simply not worth the risk, it's uneconomical.  Now, most reefer is domestic. There is less pressure on  the domestic producer (showy raids notwithstanding) and  thus it is economical. Of note though ... domestic reefer  is now very strong, so a small volume goes a long way.  You cannot make alcohol stronger than 200 proof - not a  good dollar/pound deal. \",\"Could some kind soul tell me the advance timing/revs for a 1981 xs1100 special (bought in Canada).\",\" I can't answer most of your questions, but I've seen it happen in  family members who are being treated with radiation and/or chemotherapy.

Can you recommend any good books, journals, or microstrip circuit design software. . all help appreciated\",\"  My whole point was not to say that the cars *couldn't* go that fast, but that they *shouldn't* go that fast.  A family sedan designed to be operable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because you added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much larger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the *brakes.*  The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power plant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications. I have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a brick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I personally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is inadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of the car is not up to par.  I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these cars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.  There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought it up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe the following to be true:  1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here. 2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than    they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them    far more predictable than most US highways. 3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have    speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in    the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not    much higher than 120km/h.  I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph (nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.  Some people have no respect for their own lives.    If you think so you sure don't pay attention to my postings.\",\"     I don't doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders. It's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology, and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, the proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what exists now.      The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs, probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say) a DES keysearch machine.      As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination could acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since it would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked jodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency or organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak- nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for (say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the complaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars to build a keysearch machine for.)      How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?  How about home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers? \\\"Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately. Maybe I can help...\\\"        Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistant to \\\"practical cryptanalysis.\\\"  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how several NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.  And NSA confidential data was *not* subject to being requested by thousands of police organizations and courts across the land.\",\"To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota:    From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people  in the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St.  Paul \\\"Pioneer Press\\\" wrote an article giving the \\\"inside scoop\\\" on the  issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible  candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic  Center (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty  confident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will  ultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other  two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the  inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name)  believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also,  because of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed  until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.   However, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed,  because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for  conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to  this mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future  viability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even  further.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of  knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging  Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met,  which may happen.  Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are  Hartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \\\" Ice Demons?\\\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't  been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the  Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in  as many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see  Hartford and Tampa show up there either. So, Minnesota may end up  getting another team, but it may take a few years.     Go Sabres!\",\"  *nnnnnnnng* Thank you for playing, I cannot agree with this.  I believed this and to put it nicely, it was a piece of junk!  I loved this car, I babied it, I pampered it, and after 2 years, it just couldn't stay together, I would say that not everyone will have the problems that I had, but know this, it's not just the car, it is the ability to get the car fixed, which will NOT happen at any chrysler/dodge/take your pick dealer.  I don't care if there are going to reform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe it when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up, just looking, you don't even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10) salesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you, and try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards. Service is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but they tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of work/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care of this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took it to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn't have been.  1988 Dodge Shadow ES  These were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.  Engine  4 Alternators Rear Suspension Torsion Bar 2 Water pumps 5 thermostats Hall effect sensor Main computer 4 Batteries  These were rebuilt/repaired  Radiator Automatic Transmission Power Steering   Those are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  For about a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it's a good car, I just can't find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I traded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I just stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000 worth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite me.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the hell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.  You can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but Japanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I feel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler product again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I will admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM isn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do their divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.    Don't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a hawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car is really good, until it has proved itself to me.  But since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because I used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good thing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were they moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend always thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.  And although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I will use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink with the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the shadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the chrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just average.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You can find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched the Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal of information about this company, just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for good reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I think this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in Toyota said and I quote, \\\"We are watching them very closely.\\\"  Come on, everybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been kicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to set in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They are still struggling because they haven't learned yet.  They have the ability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date, but their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.  It's called competition gentleman/women if you don't satisfy the demand of the consumer, well your out..    *asbestos suit on*\",\"  For that matter, it shouldn't be that difficult to design a black box that gives off EMR similar to a monitor with gibberish on the screen....     \",\" We all know this will never happen.

Opinion polls show that most people belive the Bill of Rights to grant too much freedom to people, when it is not identified as such (BTW, if anyone knows of a cite for that, I'd love to have it).  Not only does this mean that these people are  willing to give up everyone (else's) rights, they don't even know what  the Bill of Rights actually says.  How can we show the average person (not the average USENET reader) that people are actually entitiled to these rights?  So many people don't care if the government is taking more and more control of us all, a little  at a time.  \",\" OK, here's at least one Christian's answer:  Jesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes sense.  Matt 5:17 \\\"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\\\"  Jesus lived under the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises of the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey God's purposes.  Verse 18 says \\\"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law, until all is accomplished.\\\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last  phrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \\\"accomplished\\\" what the  Law was supposed to accomplish.    Verse 19:  \\\"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\\\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish  people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.  In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he  must have received about \\\"doing away with the Law.\\\"  That was not  Jesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it  should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his  people all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your  heel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \\\"doing  away with the Law\\\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as  equal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious  leaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only  God's Law.  In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law  and defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon  on the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people  understand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which  had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.  In Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the  Law in this way:  [23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being  shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore  the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be  justified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no  longer under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith  in Christ Jesus.  I believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had  served it's purpose, i.e. \\\"our tutor to lead us to Christ,\\\" and now, \\\"we are no longer under a tutor.\\\"  The law has been \\\"fulfilled\\\"  as Christ said he would do.  God, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same personality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \\\"last will and testament\\\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles.  It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are re-expressed in Christianity.   On the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and  Christians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes  sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to  represent the \\\"mysteries\\\" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism  representing Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8), The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff, Acts 20:7)  OK, That's one Christian's explanation.

No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if you're grounded in some other way at the same time.    The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.    They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere, repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.)  What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact, depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.  There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers.

Anyway...)   The basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of Mary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles  and all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were present when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days later, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was still unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There was no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their   preaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently  considered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the apostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of the assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.\",\"   Let me add another of my concerns: Yes, I can buy a port of Motif for \\\"cheap\\\", but I cannot get the source for \\\"cheap\\\", hence I am limited to using whatever X libraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of Motif.

On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available.    The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5.

Here is some  information \\\"from the horse's mouth\\\".  (Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (\\\"clearing\\\") meant to  be *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying  the material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,)  From National Telecommunications and Information Systems  Security (NTISS) \\\"Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation  Security Guidelines\\\"  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87):  ------  \\\"7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk,  cassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the  entire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be  cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that overwrites  each location with a given character.  Fixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting  at least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by  applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each  location on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that  this program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware:  some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not  actually do this.  Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or  released for destruction; however, they should be marked and  controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of  information ever recorded.  7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a  degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of  that type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)  If a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is  operative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to  employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all  addressable locations at least three times by writing any character,  then its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros)  alternatively.  When fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify  the media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two  alternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk  pack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved  degaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the  vendor's facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter)  removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for  destruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new  platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.  7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media\\\"  [see DoD Computer Security Center, \\\"Department of Defense Magnetic  Remanence Security Guideline\\\", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE  ONLY]  ------  This and many other interesting documents (many that are more  informative than probably intended) on computer security procedures  can be obtained (free) from:  Executive Secretary National Telecommunications and Informations   Systems Security Committee National Security Agency Fort George G.

Goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal (Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau), but Buffalo has no answer to Neely (not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's one of my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin :) ).  And the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway.  But I think it will go six.   Agreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, or does everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!  Final  I can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for 6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play in the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear territorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will not be putting money on this series. :-)    Agreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent of the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is credit to NY.   Agreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent team, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.   I think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don't think it will go six either...*maybe* five.   If Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They own the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once again I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the Habs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.    Chicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good, IMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.   Very true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out why Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three  at MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.   It _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all.  And yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.    Our first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their size *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team chasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.   This is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough.  I don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a non-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate Gretzky.  LA in six.   If it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be LA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.   Wow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I picked LA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.   If Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet against the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong because they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose, though, I'd have to take the Penguins.  A side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than Gilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from the age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team. I'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while he and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge), Gilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp. from Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill.

Move to Canada.  Yesterday I was able to watch FOUR games...the NJ-PITT at 1:00 on ABC, LA-CAL at 3:00 (CBC),  BUFF-BOS at 7:00 (TSN and FOX), and MON-QUE at 7:30 (CBC).  I think that if each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd consecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess).  I have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE and keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two afternoon games.  Btw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemed to know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore and they did an excellent job.  They were quite impartial also, IMO.  \",\"  So does that mean that anyone who is a Christian to avoid Hell isn't really a Christian at all? It sounds like it to me.

Above, Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre science that makes smaller steps.  In most of this thread, I have been concerned with the difference between what is science and what is not.   Lee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between Einstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of their thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts are scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or Korzybski as examples.  If you don't like these, choose your own.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong. Both Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to do this.    Let me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked to review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many kinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is that the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of criticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either not important or not interesting.  The first difference is the one that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the one that Lee Lady seems to be discussing.    I have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered  scientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims, not just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect that traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work; what it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the presence of qi.   Certainly a \\\"theoretical structure that makes sense\\\" is the goal. In areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with forming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Let's face it: we cannot always wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything clear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. \",\" It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.  I can even imagine this being found legal and constitutional, since nothing is actually listened to until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained.  Imagine archiving all pay-phone conversations, so if someone turns out to be a drug dealer, you can listen to all their past drug deals.  And archive calls to/from suspected Mafia members, potential terrorists, radicals, etc.  Imagine the convenience for the police of being able to get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the World Trade Center bombers made in the past year.  Since archiving would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do, why wouldn't it happen?\",\"I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc. It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you very much).   well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell me the order of the wires.   there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.   if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.   btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of little boxes). Oh, well . . .   one more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus--- you're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in other words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible. it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order.   omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution so others can, too. thanx for the input.\",\"THE WHITE HOUSE                    Office of the Press Secretary                    (Pittsburgh, Pennslyvania) ______________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                         April 17, 1993                                       RADIO ADDRESS TO THE NATION                          BY THE PRESIDENT                               Pittsburgh International Airport                     Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania                             10:06 A.M. EDT                                          THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to you this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio station in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to meet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs, health care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly broadcast with the American people.                             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when it reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past seven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with the people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus tour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last year's campaign.                            Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with you, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and what I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting to you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.                            You sent me to Washington to get our government and economy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad experiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important it is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do business.                              We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations rise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness of their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the cooperative experience and spirit that exists between business, labor and government.  Although many of the economies of the industrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've made many of the smart investments and the tough choices which our government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them have been moving ahead and too many of our people have been falling behind.                            We have an economy today that even when it grows is not producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation by four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to show for it.  We know that wages of most working people have stopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks and that too many families can no longer afford the escalating cost of health care.                            But we also know that, given the right tools, the right incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and businesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy needs to expand opportunity and to make our communities better places to live.                            In many critical products today Americans are the low cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that we create more of those kinds of jobs.                            Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for long-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old priorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to be -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs and education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the waste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious resources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the groundwork for robust economic growth in the future.                            These new directions passed the Congress in record time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our country.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would create hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private sector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It now has the support of a majority of the United States Senate.  But it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the Senate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know would result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.                            The issue isn't politics; the issue is people.  Millions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and counting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill has been grounded by gridlock.                              I know the American people are tired of business as usual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin or wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have taken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra mile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25 percent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.                              It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million Americans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill languish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean hundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to act to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking this initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I think we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant portion of our original goals.                            First, we want to keep the programs as much as possible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs, including highway and road construction, summer jobs for young people, immunization for children, construction of waste water sites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding for extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who have been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't creating jobs.                            Second, I've recommended that all the other programs in the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40 percent.                            And third, I've recommended a new element in this program to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against crime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire police officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put them back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight for a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it and deserve it.                            Now, the people who are filibustering this bill -- the Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it increases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this year that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable, doesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more than paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this budget is well within the spending limits already approved by the Congress this year.                            It's amazing to me that many of these same senators who are filibustering the bill voted during the previous administration for billions of dollars of the same kind of emergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the American people to work.                              This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered a plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities are -- on people or on politics.                              Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar for dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the soundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our children.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs and investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of us when we've helped make more American partners working to ensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.                            You know, if every American who wanted a job had one, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this country today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first step to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country again.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid for over the life of our budget.                            Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how important the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.                            Good morning, and thank you for listening.\",\" Well, maybe it will be.

These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me.  1.      Is it true that many arab countries don't recognize Israeli nationality ?  That people with Israeli stamps on their passports can't enter arabic countries?  2.      Is it true that arabic countries such as Jordan and Syria have undefined borders and that arab governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of their states should be?  3.      Is it true that arab countires refused to sign the Chemical weapon convention treaty in Paris in 1993?  4.      Is it true that in arab prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ?  4a. Is it true that some arab countries, like Syria, harbor Nazi war criminals, and refuse to extradite them?  4b. Is it true that some arab countries, like Saudi Arabia, prohibit women from driving cars?  5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the Muslim countries are subject to different laws than Muslims?  6.      Is it true that arab countries confiscated the property of entire Jewish communites forced to flee by anti-Jewish riots?  7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed a chemical weapons treaty that no arab nation was willing to sign?  8.      Is it true that Syrian Jews are required to leave a $10,000 deposit before leaving the country, and are no longer allowed to emmigrate, despite promises made by Hafez Assad to George Bush?  9.  Is it true that Jews in Muslim lands are required to pay a special tax, for being Jews?  10.     Is it true that Intercontinental Hotel in Jerusalem was built on a Jewish cemetary, with roads being paved over grave sites, and gravestones being used in Jordanian latrines?  11. Is it really cheesy and inappropriate to post lists of biased leading questions?  11a. Is it less appropriate if information implied in Mr. Davidsson's questions is highly misleading?

During the second  Imlach era, when Darryl Sittler was called a \\\"cancer on the team\\\", he tore the C off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain.  Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly captaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead, Sittler got traded to Detroit.  Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and they took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago.  During Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach, in an  attempt  to  kiss the  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman, the Leafs took the A away from Brad Marsh to give to Leeman.  Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  tried to give it back to Marsh, he wouldn't take it neither.  The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late of the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably one of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  of playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be- came the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a captain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the players.  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  making sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.   -- \",\"The 4/100 prints out the following message about it's framebuffer  cgtwo0 at vme24d16 0x400000 vec 0xa8  cgtwo0: Sun-3 color board, fast read  Anybody know the story on this? --  - Can I have an IMPULSE ITEM instead?\",\"  I find this argument very strange, though not unfamiliar.  An analogy someone used a while back can perhaps illustrate it.  Say, for example, there are people living on a volcanic island, and a group  of geologists determine that a volcano is imminent. They warn the people on  the island that they are in danger, and should leave. A group of people on  the island is given the task of warning others of the danger.  They believe the danger is real, but others may not.   Does that mean that the first group are NECESSARILY arrogant in warning  others of the danger? Does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs  are correct, and all others are false?

Ms. Friedman  gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup,  (even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to  minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine  and drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank  her for an entertaining evening.    ANNUAL MEETING  In addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is  also the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official  notice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main  purpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit  member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and  to elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two  year term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following  slate for the Board.           Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen          Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith          Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia          Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)          Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)          Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)          David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)  Those remaining on the Board for another year are:           Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)          Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn          Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy          Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)          Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)          Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)  This may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work  and with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have  backups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition  to the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also  be accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board  members and there is plenty of work.   In addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be  given and the floor will be open for any new business,  suggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.  We will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the  majority of the time with Dr. Teperman.  FUTURE MEETINGS  Remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.         May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry                   Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center       June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony                    Brook Kidney Transplant Program.   Plan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.  NOTDAW  The week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor  Awareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases,  speaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and  Gaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game    because of two year's experience with miserable weather.   We all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We  have found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish  a letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to  address the congregation, or include mention of the gift of  life in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample  letter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.  DR. STARZL TO BE HONORED   The Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will  hold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the  Fountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas  Starzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and  are going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne  Treffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.  MEMBERSHIP NEWS   Congratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant  in Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing  well after only 12 days in hospital.  Arthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston  Marathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation  works!  We hope the national press notices.        Bob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his  transplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis  and feeling better.    Nicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie,  spent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems  encountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida.   They are back in New York where Nicole's treatment will  continue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery.   Kay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall  that resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a  candidate for the Board so we need her well soon.   And best wishes to all coming out of the flu. It was a tough  winter for many, but the tulips are just under the snow.\",\"Posting for a friend: please call Steve, 415 252-1618, if interested.

Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who                themselves has AIDS..it is unlikely (not impossible) they will get AIDS          from acupuncture needles. Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant  involved with acupuncture needle insertion.   Most acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They       do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of  diseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise \\\"disposable needlesused here.\\\" These needles tend to be of a lower quality however,  being poorly manufactured and too \\\"sharp\\\" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                         If I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get  their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.       The risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly  use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong               patient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates  this risk. Better quality needles tend to \\\"slide\\\" past vessels and             nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                         Acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all  solid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into  meridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require  the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be  injected into the body as it would  be in a typical \\\"shot.\\\" when the skin is  puntured. On the other hand when the solid  acupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to \\\"squeeze\\\" the needle  from the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that  haven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain  on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior.   Of course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory  and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture  site.   While I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease  transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for  what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful. \",\"The title says it all...If you have some cheap used  GAMEBOY or TG-16 (2 Player or more) Games, Please email me all offers...\",\"   Actually, that is no longer true.

The SAE numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature  5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.  Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.  Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).  In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something.  Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature,  but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.    If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives, stick to the 10W40.  \",\" I feel like Winston Churchill in 1941 :( ...... but, the privacy Clipper will, TO THE EXTENT KEY ESCROW IS LEGITIMATE, stop most of the abuse of wiretaps by local cops, company cops, angry husbands/ wives, etc...

X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X * The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X   and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X   It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X   incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X   consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X * The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X   to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()  X   using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X * You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X   it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the  X   ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same  X   title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be  X   sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X * With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above  X   format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X   something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X   Email message to the judges. X X * Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless  X   'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X * To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X   each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X   should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X * The entry's remarks should include: X     - what this program does X     - how to run the program (sample args or input) X     - special compile or execution instructions, if any X     - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X     - information about any ---data--- files X     - why you think the program is obfuscated X     - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X     - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X * Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X   portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They  X   should not be required to exist. X X   If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X   section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple  X   ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X   each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X    'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X    'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X        digit, followed by '.c' X    your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X        title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not  X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to: X X  ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate X  obfuscate@toad.com X X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'. X X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however.

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers  X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with  X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor  X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X * look at the original source X * convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X * run it through a C beautifier X * examine the algorithm X * lint it X * compile it X * execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting \\\"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake\\\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X #define d define X #d foo     <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X int i; X j;     <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you  X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in  X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X int i; X char *c; X i[c];     <--- use c[i] instead X (i+3)[\\\"string\\\"];   <--- use \\\"string\\\"[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X * assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X * casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X * passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X * passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X * performing arithmetic on va_list variables X * using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X * are very hardware specific X * are very OS or Un*x version specific X      (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X       code is likely not to be) X * dump core or have compiler warnings X      (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X * won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X * abusing the build file to get around the size limit X * obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X * are longer than they need to be X * are similar to previous winners X * are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X * are as concise and small as they need to be X * do something at least quasi-interesting X * pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X * are portable X * are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X * MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X * make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X where this program differs from the contest rules, the X contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule: 1993 Xfix: n Xtitle: chonglab Xentry: 0 Xdate: Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost: Un*x v6, pdp11/45 X 2.9BSD, pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

If an entry wins, we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition, X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award, X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X * Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X * Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X  cc prog.c -o special_name  need special binary X X     or  rm -f special_src.c   need special source X  cp prog.c special_src.c X  cc special_src.c -o special_name X X     or  rm -f special_build   need special build X  tail +4 build > special_build X  sh < special_build X X * Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of  X   your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You  X   should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the  X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X     X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer  X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as  X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many  X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X date -u \\\"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\\\" X date -u | sed -e 's/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/' X sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X ---entry--- section X all ---author--- sections X all ---info--- sections X ---build--- section X ---program--- section X any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X * reading the ---entry--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X * passing the source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X * performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X * passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X * linting the source X * compiling/building the source X * running the program X * performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X * best small one line program X * best small program X * strangest/most creative source layout X * most useful obfuscated program X * best game that is obfuscated X * most creatively obfuscated program X * most deceptive C code X * best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X * best abuse of ANSI C X * worst abuse of the rules X * <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry  X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,  X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X     comp.lang.c    comp.unix.wizards alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X     comp.sources.d   alt.sources.d  misc.misc X     comp.sources.misc   comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we   agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.   When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could   get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he   started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had   miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed   another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was   their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I   reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be   treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole   deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,   snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by   the turn of events.  Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting   to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and   asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him   that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,   that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs   and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still   pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to   lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told   him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.  A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all   apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus   knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about   it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,   and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....  I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we   decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him   back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the   truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the   incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of   there in my new truck in about 30 mins.  So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not   have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales   person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I   sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their   mistake.  Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred   dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.

So that the non-muslim readers of this group will see how far from  the simple basics of Islam such views are on the face of them. And  if they are _not_ in contradiction with the basics of Islam, how  subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while  they are explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an.     In my opinion considering any human being as having a substance or metaphysical fundamentally different from that of any other human being _is_ a heretical notion and one proscribed by Islam.      Absolutely! I would be interested in discussing this privately and I am interested in hearing how one might try to make the concept of error-free and sinless human beings philosophically consistent with the teachings of the Qur'an. However, _prima facie_ such attemptsa are highly susceptible to degenerating into monkery, explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an.

Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished  of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only  the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian  Armenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of  Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines  genocide as acting with a     'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a     national, ethnic, racial or religious group.'   History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate  the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the  Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including  U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy  as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of  the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the  extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor  those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians.   The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established, beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian  territories.  The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed. The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian  Government.  The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were Dro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri, Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.

Unlike  bandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People that cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are afraid to be associated with something negative.   On this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP's is  because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top. If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people  for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had  conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any better/worse than the whites did.  The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of the world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done (ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the present generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do  any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped hundreds, even thousands, of years ago.   My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's change them. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settle anything anyway.   That's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just because they are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school and after high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make you right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only a couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, not to yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care how you appear (ie. a Winner).   If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \\\"At that moment the bottom fell out of Authur's mind.

The scribe Matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's main strategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even about the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in the New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at least 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much happened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we will take particular claims at face value.  Immanuel:         We begin, of course, at the beginning.         (Mt 1.21-22):  \\\"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,        Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is        salvation), for he will save his people from their        sins.\\\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had        spoken by a prophet:         [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),        king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made        war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not        quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz        and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its        heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the        lord G'd said to Isaiah, \\\"go to meet with Ahaz...\\\"         ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,        naturally) saying, \\\"Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It        can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\\\"  But,        Ahaz said, \\\"I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a        test.\\\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \\\"Hear then, O house of        David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that        you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord        himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman        is with child and will bear a son, and name him        \\\"Immanuel,\\\" which means, \\\"G'd is with us.\\\"   He will        eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil        and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to        refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings        you dread will have been deserted...  Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics.  Further, he the Hebrew word \\\"almah,\\\" (young woman), as specifically, \\\"virgin.\\\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the Messiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years later.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In short, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of context, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary, virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course, the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by later Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by the name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy for Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second class prophecy.   Not too convincing.  Egypt:         After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a quick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he wishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.         [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of        Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:        \\\"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\\\"   What the lord really said was this.         [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him.         And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called        them (my people), the more they went from me; they        kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning        incense to idols.  Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it was indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to return.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of here.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind up with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.  Rachel Weeps:          While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that King Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of all young male children.  Matthew then writes,         [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the        prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:         \\\"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud        lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;        she refused to be consoled, because they were        no more.\\\"     The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722 BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim, and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \\\"no more.\\\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.        It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who was the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and Bethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \\\"children,\\\" it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city, \\\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\\\"        As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely that such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible, nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time.  Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a prime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance the message of the church's gospel.        Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the infant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set up by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus. It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \\\"children\\\" the prophet speaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd comforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be returned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this would not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are dead for good.  Again, the \\\"prophecy\\\" Matthew sets up is not even that, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too convincing.  The Nazarene:         We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth,          [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets        might be fulfilled, \\\"He shall be called a Nazarene.\\\"  First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of the prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \\\"He\\\" is.  There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse, there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still worse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at all.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that she will,         [Judges 13.5]  \\\"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor        shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his        god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel        from the hands of the Philistines.\\\"  This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd.  But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has begun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is simple making them up now.  Bearing our Diseases:         Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and disabilities.         [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the        prophet Isaiah, \\\"He took our infirmities and bore our        diseases.\\\"  As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context, and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,         [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has        borne our sickness, and carried our pains.  From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the Israelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish identity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the instrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.       The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and discipline.  They do not speak of a \\\"servant\\\" going around and healing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus, as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but rather something that had already happened.  While it is believed that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear the illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say that, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his spiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel misses where he intended it to have its effect.   Silent Messiah:        Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus ordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse the attention of the local rulers.         [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by        the prophet Isaiah.            \\\"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,        with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on        him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He        will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear        his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised        reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings        justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his        name.\\\"  The Isaiah passage quoted reads,         [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my        chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my        spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the        nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or        make it heard in the street.  He will not break a        bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will        faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail        (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has        established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands        await his law.  You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage, because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could never think of Jesus failing, never would the \\\"light\\\" of mankind burn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to an end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace G'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will be the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed from the Judaic \\\"...the coastlands await his law.\\\" to the Christologic, \\\"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\\\"   While the original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of \\\"believing in the name.\\\"  If one has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only to read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant, \\\"a people robbed and plundered...\\\"   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at \\\"prophecy\\\" is examined, it crumbles.  Three Days and Three Nights:        Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection.         [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the        whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son        of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and        three nights.  Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know how the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was 24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset 6pm.  What was referred to as a \\\"day\\\" was the period of light from 6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time scale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until 6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays.  (It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus, when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight portions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus, Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three nights.        As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \\\"ninth hour,\\\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the grave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \\\"rose,\\\" before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was over).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for clarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before 6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm Friday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two nights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this is a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to suspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little mistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his god's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more than unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.  Hearing & Understanding:       Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if you were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the message of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand them, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not accept the \\\"plain\\\" message any better.  Matthew says,         [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in        fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says,          \\\"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you        will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this        people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of        hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they        would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and        understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal        them.\\\"  The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his call to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is flourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria.  Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd, calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.         [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, \\\"Go, and say to this        people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and        see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this        people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their        eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear        with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and        turn and be healed.\\\"  Then Isaiah said, \\\"How long,        lord?\\\"  And he said, \\\"Until the cities lie waste        without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the        land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far        away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And        though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned        again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still        stands when the tree is felled.\\\" The holy seed is its        stump.  Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel to stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the promise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you read the rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look at Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)      We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion of Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that, he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't understand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are not prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the present.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face.        Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they have the prophetic approval.         [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a        parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the        prophet, \\\"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I        will utter that which has been hidden since the        foundation of the world.\\\"  Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a prophet, but from the Psalms.         [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will        utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have        heard and known, things that our fathers have told us.         We will not hide them from their children, but tell to        the coming generation the glorious deeds of the        lord...  As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come from a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies of Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet.  Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it up.      Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once again, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus has said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not understand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden.  Further, they speak of things \\\"known, that our fathers have told us.\\\"  Jesus deals with things \\\"hidden since the foundation of the world.\\\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion.  This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No wonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again, Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But, Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.   Excuses of Little Faith:         In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what epilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were possesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were unable to \\\"dispossess\\\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more enlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying they didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this demon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or he does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move mountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can move real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to Mexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old woman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.         And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their sacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in heaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.         Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time or a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the theologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see God anymore.         We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're        sinful; it's just his \\\"plan\\\"; we put too many of our        own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right        faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...       Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear reader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be true. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your heart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say our little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they say, \\\"See the love in these people you worship with... see the lives of people change... that is seeing G'd.\\\"   Thus people get lulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday sights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is not seeing G'd the way people used to see.         What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of human hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the forgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created by the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are what we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody has little faith.   Jesus Rides on an Ass:         Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah king, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into Jerusalem.           [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken        by the prophet, saying,         Tell the daughter of Zion, \\\"Behold, your king is        coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a        ass-colt.\\\"  Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little differently.         Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and        victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-        colt... he will command peace to the nations.  There isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah only involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the poetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two donkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological, proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written earlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to Jesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has bungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses, the situation is often reversed nowadays...         Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But, Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,         [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of        babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'  It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus was never one to point out such little \\\"prophetic\\\" things AND since, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to fit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or Matthew, \\\"Haven't you read?\\\" for the source reads,         [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is        your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is        chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you        have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the        enemy and the avenger.  The passages hardly need comment.  There is no \\\"perfect praise\\\" spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd, not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be just one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic scripture.  YHVH said to  my lord...:        Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish messiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king David.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,         \\\"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until        I put your enemies under your feet.\\\"  Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic descent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of course, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to make some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation.  But, there are problems.        In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the messiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the messiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king, bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's rule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the Christians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this psalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had also made.  One must remember that there were various factions among the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the messiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like his audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and who interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic. What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,         YHVH's utterance to my lord:  \\\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your        footstool.\\\"         YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule        in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer        themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the        holy mountains.           \\\"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek        forever.\\\"  The word \\\"lord\\\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian bibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the word is \\\"adoni,\\\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means \\\"lord,\\\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an address of respect.         There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is supposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the psalm translates to either \\\"a psalm of David,\\\" or \\\"a psalm about David.\\\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the psalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be talking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended from David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive tales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any praises of a messiah.      Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after David was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of favour for David's kingdom on hold.        The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was promised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies, successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king, enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.       We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone, though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though his use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this event is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off a little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note, though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd.  Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of an infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we might expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.  Moses & Jesus, Had it Together All Along...:         We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a pseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John deserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew.  But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah king, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this was accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the promise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.         [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,        rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.  It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but, Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian.  I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament which corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the course to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like his forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they still cling to it.  The Potter's Field:        We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by one of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,         [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver        in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief        priests, taking the silver, said, \\\"It isn't lawful for        us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood        money.\\\"  So they... bought a potter's field with it to        bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was        spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,         \\\"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price        of him on whom a price had been set by some of the        sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's        field, as the lord directed me.\\\"  This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament Scripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which Matthew makes use of.         [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,        thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \\\"Cast        them to the treasury,\\\" --the lordly price at which I        was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of        silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of        YHVH.  First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely a priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with one another.  The word, \\\"treasury,\\\" had been replaced by the King James Scholars with \\\"to the potter,\\\" precisely because this made Matthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed \\\"treasury,\\\" which also makes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas \\\"potter's field\\\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given Matthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty.       Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the text.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if as most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to toss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high priests.  The high priests would not put the money in the treasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the opposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student, the \\\"prophecy\\\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New Testament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing enough.  Wine, Vinegar, & Casting Lots:        Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.         [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,        mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not        drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they        divided his garments among them by casting lots: that        it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,         \\\"They parted my garments among them, and upon my        vesture did they cast lots.\\\"  First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour wine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find that right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him some to drink --not polluted with gall.         [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \\\"I thirst.\\\"  A bowl of        vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the        vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he        had received the vinegar, he said, \\\"It is finished;\\\"  But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the prophets, but one from the Psalms.         [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;        and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me        poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and        for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add        to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no        acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the        Book of the Living.  Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request of drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm quoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It is not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the \\\"Jesus\\\" in the psalm asks G'd for the damnation of the \\\"crucifiers,\\\" whereas the Jesus of the gospels says,         [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \\\"Father, forgive them, the        don't know what they do!\\\"  Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his meat, as the psalm stipulates.         With the \\\"prophecy\\\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally ask, \\\"What of the casting of lots?\\\"  This brings up the 22nd Psalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to say that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no great thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon in those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of Jesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions, his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some suspicions.  The 22nd Psalm:        This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of praise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We will examine the primary passages.         Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?!         Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words        of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you        don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.  Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross.  This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather than king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \\\"the lamb led mute before its shearers.\\\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much groaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross.         6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men...         All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag        their heads;  \\\"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let        him deliver him... for he delights in him.\\\"  This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.         12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their        mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.         16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of        evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and        feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my        garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.         19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my        soul from the sword, my life from the power of the        dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my        afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!  It would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately, this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \\\"have pierced\\\" really do not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,         16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of        evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my        hands and feet...  In Hebrew the phrase \\\"like the lion\\\" and a very rare verb form which can mean \\\"pierced\\\" differ by one phonetic character.  The word in the Hebrew text is literally, \\\"like the lion\\\" (ka'ari), which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that would urge a Christian to change the word to \\\"ka'aru.\\\"   But, to add the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \\\"prophecy\\\" this is just what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to Jesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators.         Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend itself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the psalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather the forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.        Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord Jesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian theology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful fundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might have been \\\"enhanced\\\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But, it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good things for St. Matthew.  The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's crucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after the fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,         [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his        side with a spear, and out came blood and water...        these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...        \\\"The will look on him whom they've pierced.\\\"  Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with them.         [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...        And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations        that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will        pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on        Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have        pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him        like you weep over a firstborn child.  John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that Matthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more than just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and blatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel writers, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded.    Reckoned with Transgressors:         After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming the Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of the gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.         [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,        one on his right, one on his left.  And so the        scripture was fulfilled which says,         \\\"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\\\"  Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53, about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the messiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its surrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The servant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the description of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the messiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between two thieves would fulfill the \\\"prophecy\\\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons.         Mark goes on to tell us how \\\"those who were crucified with [Jesus] also reviled him.\\\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a couple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke decides to change some things.  Luke tells us,         [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged        with him railed, \\\"Aren't you the messiah?! Save        yourself, and us!\\\"  This certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the people who crucified Jesus said, \\\"Save yourself!\\\" and that the robbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,         But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,        \\\"Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same        sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,        for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds.         But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,        \\\"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\\\"         And Jesus answered, \\\"Verily I say to you, today you        will be with me in paradise.\\\"  Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man, apparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have been a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by Luke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.   Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case, the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have seen.  The End of the World--        Mt. 24:         Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and his disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world which he has been warning about.         The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's        destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your        coming, and of the close of the age?         Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for        many will come in my name, saying, \\\"I am the christ.\\\"          ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for        this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,        nation will rise against nation... all this is but the        beginning of the birthpangs.              They will deliver you up... put you to death,        and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.        ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This        gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a        testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.              So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the        prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to        the mountains.               Immediately after the tribulation of those days,        the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from        heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man        in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,        and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out        his angels... and gather his elect...              Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its        branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know        that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these        things, you will know that He is near, at the very        gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not        pass away until all these things take place...              But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the        angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,        you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming        at an hour you do not expect.  From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells them that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it will come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error.  But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the End, and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be swept away.       There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \\\"this generation shall not pass away...\\\" really means \\\"this race of people will not pass away...\\\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples.  It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek, he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at least some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World.  The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from Rev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus meant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.         For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th chapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000 years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back, hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon.  Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how tired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for just the right moment to spring?          So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth, (Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or three days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three eternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine radiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best interests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway.  As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them, Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have seen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout Church history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple belief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away from question.  To question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely accepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time.  Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity have been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support wars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which Christianity can securely keep hold.\",\"Kent:       You say that                        ^^^^^^^^^                         Please don't!  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^       Name just three *really* competing Rosicrucian Orders.

THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                 Dorothy Denning                             Revised, April 21, 1993   INTRODUCTION  On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key.   CHIP CONTENTS  The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the \\\"MYK-78.\\\"  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about $30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the technology is shrunk to .8 micron.   ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.  The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the session key:     D[E[M; K]; K] = M .   CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW  All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at Mykotronx.  At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.    To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a 64-bit block R1:          R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .  Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:            R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]          R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .  R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies.  As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit key parts.    The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind.   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2, and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies.   The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or both may be independent from the government.   LAW ENFORCEMENT USE  When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder.   CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION  A successor to the Clipper Chip, called \\\"Capstone\\\" by the government and \\\"MYK-80\\\" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for delivery in June or July. \",\"    Just observed at the National Model United Nations here in NYC.

When someone claimed that guerillas were manifestations of popular sentiment, the topic arose:\\\"When does a civilian stop becoming a civilian?\\\".  If he houses and shelters guerillas of his own free will, aiding them, has he violated his \\\"civilian\\\" status?   But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways? If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Afterall, Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.   That is not exactly true.  The Hizbollah and their affiliated groups have made several attempts to infiltrate the border of Israel.   True, but the Syrians did allow (until at least 1984) guerillas to operate in the areas that were under their control, provided that those guerillas were attacking Israeli lines.  The problem is that Syria is also not as stable a partner for long term peace as others in the area might be. \",\" In 1860:  region              total population  free blacks  %       slaves   % U.S.                32,227,616        487,070      1.5%    3,953,818 12.3% Confederacy          9,103,332        132,760      1.5%    3,521,110 38.7% Union Slave States   3,212,041        128,158      4.0%      432,586 13.5% All Union States    23,124,284        354,310      1.5%      432,708  1.9% Union \\\"Free\\\" States 19,912,243        226,152      1.1%          122  0.0%  \",\"####   ####                          #     ###    #                         #   1   2     3 #      Facing           #                  # Female Plug End        #  4       5   6   #                         #               #                          #            #                          #  7     8  #                          #           #                          #############  Anyone Recognize this?

I've been seeing  her every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28)  and during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every  4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period.  As it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that  though I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she  mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13  weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had  an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no  problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain  in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very  difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or  move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for  when I do need to go out.)   Anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from  the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about  2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.   (I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating  very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well  now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile  related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my  upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I  was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because  it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt   no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I  ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had  turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if  I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it  wasn't as much of a problem.  So the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid  fatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware  of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have  been avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat  foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.    But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat  except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts,  fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I  should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only  have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day (  potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in  a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or  steamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have  some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if  I'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it  from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if  she's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her  recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on  cholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She  originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the  entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I  started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and  she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also  asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them  are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain,  and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did  want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be  temporary for that one week.   What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?

The SUNDAY TIMES 8 March 1992  Morgues fill as Azeris head for all-out war  -------------------------------------------  Thomas Goltz, the first to report the massacre by Armenian soldiers in  the worst violence since the breakup of the Soviet Union, reports from  Agdam  ------  Khojaly used to be a barren town, with empty shops and treeless dirt  roads. Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier  times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off  the map.  .......  As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of  Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt  that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been  the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke  apart.  .......  I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and  people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut Ezoya,  a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the  town, called her community \\\"sitting ducks, ready to get shot\\\". She and  her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.  .......  \\\"The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and  the government does nothing.\\\" Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,  said. \\\"Next they will drive us out or kill us all,\\\" said Dilbar, his  wife. The couple, their three sons and three daughters were killed in  the assault, as were many other people I had spoken to.  ......  \\\"It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have to cross.  There was a road, and the first units of the column ran across then  all hell broke loose. Bullets were raining down from all sides. we had  just entered their trap.\\\"  The azeri defenders picked off one by one. Survivors say that Armenian  forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything moved in  the gullies. A video taken by an azeri cameraman, wailing and crying  as he filmed body after body, showed a grizzly trail of death leading  towards higher, forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge  from the Armenians.  \\\"The Armenians just shot and shot and shot,\\\" said Omar Veyselov, lying  in hospital in Agdam with sharapnel wounds. \\\"I saw my wife and  daughter fall right by me.\\\"  People wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the  loved ones. Some vented their fury on foreigners: \\\" Where is my  daughter, where is my son ?\\\" wailed a mother. \\\"Raped. Butchered. Lost.\\\"  Azerbaijan has said as many as 1,000 refugees were killed as they  tried to flee. The Armenians have denied this, saying the civilians  were caught in \\\"crossfire\\\".  .......

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH  ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO  INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...  As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw  the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as  they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to  journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts  of the hills.  The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING  of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians  last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death  or missing...   Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter  as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there  was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer  ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We  swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon  under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.  We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round  again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a  valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung  round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired  repeated blasts.  Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting  had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in  fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.  I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,  its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on  \\\"our side\\\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a  search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.  Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two  M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed  flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second  crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains  and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters  were there to give covering fire if necessary.  The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet  armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani  official told us that there were now five former Soviet military  helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \\\"They have  signed contracts to fly for us,\\\" he said. The helicopter we engaged  in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian  pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.  We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an  heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer  white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four  corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an  Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies  on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back  towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before  the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.  Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the  civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were  covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor  mortis. They had been shot.  What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,  and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY  DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

Although not many patients with Hep B go on to chronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is something to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which also leads to cirrhosis.    Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function.  Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas, among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic circulation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis.  These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in men, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplant.  Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in your friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.

It would seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of gun control laws.         I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural and enforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and then that reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.          Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a crime with it a silly solution, it still doesn't address the question of Canada.  (Which is now, by the way, blaming their rising gun-crime rate on the U.S.  Strange that the border used to \\\"magically\\\" keep the guns out, but now isn't.)          The other side of the coin, of course, is that far \\\"illegal drugs\\\" are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally.  I've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals have shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources (stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simply see South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as well, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.           And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques of it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come to mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost entirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed for poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you compared the white majority they were virutally identical.          The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs. non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative conditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of nomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into account that the non-whites in either city were not living in the same conditions.          If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns, then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which are arguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far higher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly lower.           The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. \\\"inner-city\\\" problems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a condition which is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent crime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control is the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As one Canadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun control in 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase in violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparently they didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in the early eighties.          True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., where gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that crime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.         The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high or low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact violent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than it was going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by saying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be instituted to deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, you can't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of that gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control was implemented, just as happened in Canada.          As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent of gun control.          Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what others did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would sell to them?\",\"  export.lcs.mit.edu:/pub/sunkbd..930314.tar.Z   /MaF \",\"For Sale ---          U.S.Robotics 16.8k HST external modem, including power adapter,         Users Guide and Quick-Reference Card.          $515.00.

I say, no way I've already blown about 20 hours with this, about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$ to take a day off work.  Also, my 30 day return period is almost over and I've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So, the whole  thing is going back.     I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me that I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but also the two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately, I just spoke to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything up gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer.  I would really like to try Gateway again, I'm just very turned off by the prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support again...  I think their products are great for the most part, but I'm beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation. Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact?  I know Gateway is booming, and for good reason, but I don't know if I can take it again. Oh well, I feel better now... \",\"  I _know_ I shouldn't get involved, but...   :-)  [bit deleted]   Righto, DAN, try this one with your Cornflakes...  The book says that Muhammad was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a  modern day Mad Mahdi) or he was actually who he said he was. Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would  die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People  gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing  how his son-in-law made the sun stand still.  Call me a fool, but I believe  he did make the sun stand still.   Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn  to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example  anyone who is drawn to the Mad Mahdi is obviously a fool, logical people see  this right away. Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the  real thing.    --\",\"  Computer: 286-25 mhz Bus: ISA (12.5 mhz) Drive: Maxtor 7213A (213 mb)                                      config.sys / autoexec.bat                       MS DOS 5             no           WIN 3.1                      smartdrv.sys        cache         smartdrv.exe  CORE (V 2.7)         6950 k/sec          1390 k/sec     1395 k/sec Norton SI (V 5.0)     730 k/sec           980 k/sec      982 k/sec  I'd still like to here from people with VLB-IDE.

Thanks in advance. (Reply by post or email, whichever you prefer.)  --Nizam  --\",\" As one of the \\\"Clintonites\\\" cited above, I'll try to clarify since this is not a case of Clinton's \\\"dishonesty.\\\" (I won't necessarily defend him on other issues.)    There were NEVER any specific projects included in the Community Development Block Grant portion of the President's proposal.  Congressional Republicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what they felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL  projects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus package was ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the White House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted to Congress.  It didn't work.)  The $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close to covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it were passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and at what level.  In the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one ever expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the  Republicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS PACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total  amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus  package for ALL projects.    The plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are places where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing priorities.  If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects that will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton administration has been publicizing the issue.  A final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is worth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to them is new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally  supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending, arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending priorities than \\\"Washington bureaucrats.\\\"    Is it clear now?

Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something  I say can't be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \\\"scientific\\\"  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \\\"If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.\\\"    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \\\"There've got to be controlled studies\\\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying \\\"We don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.\\\"    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  \\\"Why should I prove your  theory?\\\"  and  \\\"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\\\"   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of  books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as I'm capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \\\"doctrinnaire\\\"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"In 12-step programs (like Alcoholics Anonymous), one of the steps involves acknowleding a \\\"higher power\\\".  AA and other 12-step abuse- recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.  Unfortunately, as evidence for God, this can be dismissed by stating that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes  people 'religious', and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but still maintain that both are escapism.  (And I suspect that there are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to Christianity.)  I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ- ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves as incomplete, and needing God (the 'God-shaped hole'), while atheists necessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  If the atheists are right, Christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly to stand up for themselves; if the Christians are right, the atheists are guilty of considerable arrogance.  (I use the term atheist to refer to a person who has a definite conviction that there is no God, as opposed to one who does not know and/or does not care about God.) == Seanna Watson   Bell-Northern Research,       | Pray that at the end of living, (seanna@bnr.ca) Ottawa, Ontario, Canada       | Of philosophies and creeds,                                               | God will find his people busy Opinion, what opinions?

The anecdotal experiences of individuals is ``superstition, not science,'' he said. ``I don't think glutamate has made them sick.''  And Dr. Robert Kenney of George Washington University conducted an double blind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to MSG also had similar reaction when they thought they had MSG but actually not.  Although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group, some of them might have been due to other causes. But because the anti MSG emotion runs so high, that some blame it for anything and everything.

He called them \\\"the Great Commission\\\" but this is NOT descriptive of Jesus's words in Matt. 10:15.  Matt. 10:14, Jerusalem Bible translation:   \\\"And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have  to say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust  from your feet.\\\"  Matt. 10:15:    \\\"I tell you solemnly, on the day of Judgment it will not    go as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with    that town.\\\"   \\\"> The above is a good description of Kaflowitz, who keeps harping on  > shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next.\\\"    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                ^^^^  The highlighted words refer to Matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively.  And Dean countered:  \\\"Actually, this comment of your's is a perfect example of what an intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are, since I specifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty to spread the word.  In fact, it is the combination of the two statements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to characterize that as \\\"ignoring\\\" the instruction to spread the word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.\\\"  Of course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of \\\"instruction to spread the word.\\\"  All these quotes btw are from:  Message-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>   And I claim it correctly, because my question went:  \\\"Do you, too, measure the goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?\\\"  and the closest Dean came to an answer was:  \\\"Peter, Peter, Peter.  You're just so stupid, pretentious, dull, and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that the sport is all there is.\\\"  Of course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts in GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this, yet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:  \\\"So I now restore the answer to your question that you deleted.  If you're still unable to figure it out, ask a nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really doesn't take much sophistication to understand.\\\"  On top of which, I doubt that the \\\"answer\\\" is at all representative of Dean's true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's  mind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken. One wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all this.  He even dredges up a falsified account of events that transpired earlier on another thread:  \\\"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the \\\"sins\\\" of other individuals.\\\" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  False.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins. That I made public announcements of the \\\"sins\\\" of others --\\\"sins\\\", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in the posts of others-- is a different matter.  Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so I pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread, YOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.  Dean again:  \\\"You made an ass of yourself by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was somehow an attempt to \\\"paint Jews as plaster saints,\\\" thereby revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well as showing your dislike for people saying positive things about Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then claiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.\\\"  Actually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite according to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing Jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as implicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.  I went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of the doubt in a post following my initial crack about \\\"plaster saints\\\",  suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.  In an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly distorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as the basis of one insult after another.\",\"   I'm not sure that's true.  Let me rephrase; \\\"You can file a complaint  which will bring the person into court.\\\"  As I understand it, a  \\\"citizens arrest\\\" does not have to be the physical detention of  the person.

The noise you hear is due to the momentary opening and closing of the path.  The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high impedance audio circuits a resistive \\\"T\\\" is constructed close to characteristic impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers the audio.  In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic impedance.  Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.  Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \\\"Make before break and Vica Versa\\\" but I haven't seen any of these for years.  Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.  A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \\\"optical isolator\\\".. It consists of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers passing the audio.  Once again this device in a \\\"T\\\" switches the audio.  Varying the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and you have a mixer!

The federal government has an interest in the intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of civil rights. It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting a lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically. It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid since over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group was getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being part of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the south stick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normally they wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were expeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to try it anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to somebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they did the school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and the president can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the militia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the thousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey or face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms! And by god, they did! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets! And the governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls that had brought the order to nationalize the guard. And that's why we need such an ability in federal jurisdiction. -RSW \",\" :   I have normal procomm plus for dos, but I've been considering buying : the windows version....it got really great reviews in computer shopper. : I have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here : using it, but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the : modem....he has a 14,400 modem on a 486 50 Mhz machine.  I can't : see it having trouble keeping up.  His pcplus for dos works great,  re: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93  This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2 or DOS apps not running under Windows.  One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST) discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer than with the old 2400bps modem.   There are three reasons for the problem:  1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most    PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the    operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high    interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and    the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded    environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.  2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and    interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely    than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you    are losing data, you may be advised that \\\"you need to upgrade to a    16550\\\". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance    about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the    store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve    my own problem had never heard the term \\\"16550\\\" and many didn't even    know what a UART was.  3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade    your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience    errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers    don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this    regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications    like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem    by themselves.  If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one. Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.   The Hardware Situation.  The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250 or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft diagnostic program \\\\WINDOWS\\\\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before* bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.  The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to 460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info, see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.  So, what UART component do you have?  Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with the numbers \\\"8250\\\" or \\\"16450\\\", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI, and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket COM board.  If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The \\\"N\\\" chip is the normal 40-pin dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550 chips without the \\\"A\\\" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).  Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips: National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552 Chips&Technology:       82C607 Texas Instruments:      t16c550a Silicon Systems:        73M550 VLSI                    16C550 TurboCom warns about the pre-\\\"A\\\" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550, says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70 systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).  If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after- market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).  Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology MCT-AIO+ card from:  JDR Microdevices 2233 Samaritan Drive San Jose  CA  95124 (800) 538-5000 voice US (408) 559-1200 voice other (800) 538-5005 FAX US  The MCT-AIO+ (and the \\\"+\\\" is important) sells for $89.95.

Meanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports, and am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based 8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set the internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.   The Software Situation  Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun problems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the 16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1 drivers have the following limitations:  - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.  - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt    rate of 10x during uploads.  - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2    more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).  - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.    With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1    or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would    be effective.  - The API won't accept rates above \\\"CBR_128000\\\".  - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even    if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit    from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.  - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.  - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.  - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port    speed options above 19200 bps.  These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0). Rumors suggest they \\\"may\\\" be solved in Windows \\\"4.0\\\".  You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of \\\"TurboCom\\\", current version 1.2, from:  Bio-Engineering Research Pacific CommWare Division 180 Beacon Hill Lane Ashland  OR   97520-9701 (503) 482-2744 voice (503) 482-2627 FAX (503) 482-2633 BBS MCImail:    344-5374 CompuServe: 71521,760  Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit cards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom but as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company per se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a market for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.  I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my datacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps when linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O. Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts are still using antique UARTs and drivers.  Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the Windows APIs and dialog boxes.  I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC) standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another 16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above 115,200 may still be risky.  Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a 16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of \\\"Windows Sources\\\" magazine. I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a \\\"power user\\\" whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems.   Closing Soapbox Comments  The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface, the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the exception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent I/O.  You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this situation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs \\\"sort of\\\" work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a hardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that use that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.

Speaking from experience here: I had to completely reinvent one of my designs some six or seven years ago when the disk file was zapped, the backups were all bad, and the devices were unreadable because of the security fuses. Made me appreciate the value of printouts.  ;-)  So on this point at least there's not so much worry.  But whether or not we can get the chips made reliably and securely is really secondary to the question of whether use of the chip is itself likely to be secure, methinks.\",\"Is it possible to use WinQVT/Net on a machine that uses NDIS to connect to a Token Ring ?

The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of  the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi  to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]    The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain  etymology. It may originally have meant \\\"member of the tribe,\\\" as in the Avestan compound mogu-tbish (\\\"hostile to a member of the tribe\\\"). This meaning would have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \\\"member of the priestly tribe\\\" and perhaps to \\\"priest\\\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is probably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \\\"Magoi\\\" as one of the six tribes of the Medes.   For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were responsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their knowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the Great (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political and civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period (Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by Darius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.   The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.   There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the Avestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \\\"gift\\\"), is not without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found, in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of purity, or separation of the \\\"mixture\\\" of the two opposed principles of spirit and matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \\\"chorus,\\\" from the root mangh, which is said to mean \\\"sing the magic song\\\" (Nyberg, 1966) and has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the Avestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite a recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore the Avestan term for \\\"priest,\\\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is  perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis  (Gershevitch, 1964).   The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in particular derives from an older form, magupati (\\\"head of the Magi\\\"). During the Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of a hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\\\"the high priest of high priests\\\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.   The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl., khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it. The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons of putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the Parsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this rite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was in vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with wax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples of Central Asia.   The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a ritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also known for the practice of killing harmful, or \\\"Ahrimanical,\\\" animals (khrafstra) such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants, tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of felt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their breath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition that is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was that of the priesthood: white.   In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this they were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible for teaching the prince the \\\"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\\\" and thus the \\\"cult of the gods.\\\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and master of himself.   During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of Gaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself Smerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation - the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media, in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.   No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were renowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of the greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in Bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were also known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism; this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek, like \\\"goes,\\\" \\\"expert in the magic arts\\\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.   To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called western Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must have been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.   The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical historians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism, belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology and eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted Zoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and placed themselves under his venerable name.   Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the Zoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \\\"the law-abjuring daivas\\\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and practices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the supreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.; Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it has been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own priesthood, would be very strange.   The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the first millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to us especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles of the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\\\"beneficent spirit\\\") and Angra Mainyu (\\\"hostile spirit\\\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans- formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro- astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the Mesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known to the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which we give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]   Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises on the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have survived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of wisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an abundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).   Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]   The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the religious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce, 1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of Iran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to establish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures in the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar and Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.\",\"I am looking for information on possible causes and long term effects of bone marrow sclerosis.

The mission  of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and  to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied  forces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda  efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among  the French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was the center of international Armenian terrorism.

What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith (i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal revelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God  must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would  honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone  who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are  rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient  for them, or because they wish to spurn God.  I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one  holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is  that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with God.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or  revealed that truth.    --  comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\",\"Unfortunately, I've got another story to add to this.

Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)  Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my pocket on two 8mm tapes.  Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At some point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that \\\"can't\\\" is a prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.  With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for every person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you need the \\\"master key\\\" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information that have to be stored an awful lot of places.  Come to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial political views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial secrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left unexplained by those that point out this threat.)   Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened many times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some fraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.  Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on the escrow databases.  We crypto types are all taught something very important at the beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the easily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a secret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million Clipper chips.  I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this doesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too many of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect that they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can try to delay things as long as possible.  Who knows.

S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a    64-bit block R1:      R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .     Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and    N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]      R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .     R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The    first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The    rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2    are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow    agencies. \",\"Jason Kratz writing:  ...

Many important victories, however, come from coordinating with legislators to ensure anti-gun/anti-hunting legislation is either amended favorably, rejected, or never voted. These quiet victories are no less impressive in protecting our fundamental civil liberties guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.     ****   Arizona - SB 1233, NRA-supported legislation concerning minors in criminal possession of firearms  passed the House 36-18, is currently awaiting action by the Governor.   Arkansas - HB 1447, Firearms Preemption Legislation was signed by the Governor making this the forty-first state to pass preemption. Preemption had passed twice in previous sessions only to be vetoed by then Gov. Bill Clinton.  HB 1417, mandatory storage of firearms, amended and then killed in committee.   Colorado - SB 42, mandating the storage of firearms with a trigger-lock, killed in committee.  SB 104,  prohibiting the sale of certain semi-auto firearms was killed in committee.

Georgia - SB 12, supposed instant check with provision allowing for up to a 7-day \\\"waiting period,\\\"  defeated in House Public Safety Committee and sent to Interim Study committee.  Mandatory storage bill -- SB 247 -- was defeated 39-15 in the Senate.  The same bill passed the upper-House 52-2 in 1992.     Illinois - HB 90, prohibiting the sale, possession, manufacture, purchase, possession, or carrying of certain semi-auto firearms, was defeated in House Judiciary II Subcommittee on Firearms. HB 91, mandatory storage legislation, failed in House Judiciary Subcommittee on Firearms. HB 1550, repeals FOID and makes FTIP, point of sale check permanent, passed out of Judiciary Committee by a 10-4-2 vote. Presently on the calendar for third reading in the House.   SB 40, mandatory storage bill, defeated in committee. SB 265, imposing a handgun excise tax, failed in Senate committee on Revenue's Subcommittee on Tax Increases.

Wisconsin - In a referendum up against all odds, the determined efforts of the Madison Area Citizens Against Crime paid off on April 6 when a nonbinding referendum banning the possession of handguns in Madison, Wisconsin, was defeated.  Despite opposition to the ban -- aired largely by firearms owners at a series of public meetings on the issue -- the Common Council voted on February 17 to place the referendum on the ballot, allowing only seven weeks of campaigning to reverse public opinion on the controversial issue.   An October 1992 poll conducted by the Wisconsin State Journal found 57% in support and 38% opposed, with 5% expressing no opinion.  By election day, of the more than 56,000 voters who went to the polls, 51% cast ballots in opposition to the proposal while 49% voted to have the Madison Common Council enact such a ban.  The campaign committee, spearheaded by the Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement and NRA-ILA, relied on neighborhood canvassing, direct mail and radio/TV advertising to educate voters on the civil liberties implications raised by enforcement of the ban if the referendum was approved.   Despite the surprising defeat, it is expected that the Madison initiative's chief proponent, Mayor Paul Soglin, will attempt to have the Common Council enact an ordinance banning handguns.

But so,  unfortunately have other nations.\",\"First, I thank collectively all people who have given good answers to my questions. In my follow-up to Jason Smith's posting, I will address some issues that have caused misunderstanding:     Yes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not escape your notice.   The correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence, but not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense.  However, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test, including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc. It does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere 'best fits' for the data.     Well, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science requires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if the theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason. Disbelievers are not punished.    This is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_? My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is unable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God.   Yes, I know that one can't believe without God's help; Luther makes this quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I'm afraid this does not change my situation.      (deletions)    No, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy, either something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody would ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but actually no existing being could give an answer.   Imagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also ask: \\\"Why nothing exists?\\\" This is equivalent to my counter-question, \\\"why nothing exists in nothingness\\\".   Now, \\\"why anything exists\\\" is equivalent to \\\"why something exists in somethingness\\\".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post.   I do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence, in general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still leave open the question \\\"why this, and not that\\\", and this is where theistic explanations come in.  Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being's existence.   This is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not? Also, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has no meaning in His case.   If I am for a reason, I've yet failed to see what it would be.  From our perspective, it looks like 'I' exist for truly random reasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can I believe there is any better reason for my existence?   Yes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better. My 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I have to admit, but I am patient.    No, it doesn't, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists, for an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.   It is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question  \\\"why do I exist, in particular\\\" is _not_ an invalid question - this is not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to tell, and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of another, especially since I found I was deluding myself.    I think \\\"pre-existence\\\" is an oxymoron. There is no time 'outside' of this spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that  perspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who are inside it.    No. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think philosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not knowable?   This is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous other questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base my faith on.   I think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves, \\\"why do I believe\\\" or \\\"why I don't believe\\\".

At the risk of offending everybody, I will interject the 13th century point of view.  Christ descended immediately into the bosom of Abraham to set captives captive.  He preached to the saved for three days before drawing them with Him back to this earth.  I'm no expert on this part, but Matthew (27:52-53) says about the death of Jesus: \\\"tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised.  And coming forth from the tombs after his resurrection, they entered the holy city and appeared to many.\\\"  (NAB)  Regarding the hell of the damned, of which you speak, Christ did not see it (Ps 16:10, Acts 2:27), although it saw Him (cf.

Perhaps you heard about anti-trust in the business world.  Since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says that, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of investing, you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly, the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate. They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.  The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic / multi-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours was no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair market value, etc... They did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist myself, but this one is hard to dismiss).     Again Adam, the devil is in the details. I don't want to get on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its OK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 is a nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it has an integer square root.    Do you actually believe this? My experience tells me that every palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home, in Palestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as an escape from hell (so to speak). I know none that agrees with you. Did you sample their opinions? I know you don't care, just being rethorical.     Don't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews). Israel probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic cleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the international community, or make the best out of a no win condition: show the world how good Israel is towards the 'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the arab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So yes, they're there. But as a community with history and roots, its dead.       I stand corrected. I meant that the jewish culture was not predominant in Palestine in recent history. I have no problem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it were predominantly Jewish. So there. what to make of the rest Palestine?    --  Sam Zbib                                         Bell-Northern Research ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Bitnet/Internet: zbib@bnr.ca                    VOICE:  (613) 763-5889                                                 FAX:    (613) 763-2626 Surface Mail: Stop 162, P.O.Box 3511, Station C, Ottawa, Canada, K1Y 4H7\",\" I always thought that the Pope was a bear.

If not, how much should i pay for an extra fpu ?. \",\"  I don't know, but I'm as willing to speculate as anyone.  Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography. Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something like DES) for the encryption.  How could the \\\"back door\\\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers used in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.  Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most straightforward to me.)  Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the message itself has a \\\"dual key\\\" property, that possession of either of two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from the DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.  It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early knowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with Clipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.\",\"FM-2 has been sold.

In practice?  The technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as I understand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.  Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule today.  But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain cellular calls and then ask a judge, \\\"Hey, can we have permission to listen to those tapes?\\\" can they?

In my encounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth.  According to them, their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of God and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way. Their way is the 'truth.'  But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason, but it seems to me a choice.  My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when I was in grade school:  A kid would say, \\\"All policemen are jerks!\\\"  I'd ask, \\\"How do you know?\\\"  \\\"Because my daddy told me so!\\\"  \\\"How do you know you're daddy is right?\\\"  \\\"He says he's always right!\\\"  Well the argument usually stops right there.  In the end, aren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as false?  -------------  This is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I apologize if I'm covering tired old ground.  Some of the discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome any comments.  --   [I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  I can understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough evidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for other religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of intelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that doesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who believe Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict it are false.  This suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than the Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where people choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent spiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in some unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of one sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But Christianity is in its essense a \\\"historical\\\" religion.  That is, it's based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out there, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways, and that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \\\"mundane\\\" world, we are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it falls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The Christian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual external reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know everything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that implies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't see how else we could proceed.  This needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking with people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and even if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.\",\"Just as the title suggest, is it okay to do that? I havne't got DOS6 yet, but I heart DoubleSpace is less tight than stacker 3.0.

I am familiar with    the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally    I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use.    If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do    fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is    a long and painful experience.   What I hate about GUI's:   - Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess    I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a    computer with one hand and use the other for holding something    like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my    favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be    done with one hand such as navigating, cutting, pasting,    searching, opening and saving files, etc. The main thing I    need to use both hands for is entering text.   I guess I need to get one of those mice with, like, 20 buttons  or something and then I will have the best of both worlds.\",\"We need a good concave ->convex polygon conversion routine. I've tried a couple without much luck.  Please E-mail responses and I will post a summary of any replies.  Thank you.\",\"   I think that you are changing the meaning of \\\"values\\\" here. Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.  value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in  usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus.  The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound.   In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing.  In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the word \\\"value\\\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as \\\"objective values.\\\"  Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow. Just because the word \\\"values\\\" is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts.  If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  So, back to the original question:  And objective morality is.....?  If you can provide an objective foundation for \\\"morality\\\" then that will be a good beginning. \",\": >Is there an ftp site where I can get the MS speaker sound driver?

Fitzmyer is one of the preeminent modern NT scholars.  He was also one of the early workers on the DSS.  His book is written in a straightforward Q&A that allows it to serve as a source for a great wealth of clearly presented basic, up-to-the-moment information about the DSS.

John West\",\"Hi there,  I've made a VGA mode 13h graphics library available via FTP.  I originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone here will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but are missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.  *** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it *** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a *** different version.  The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They are fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes, anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a \\\"virtual screen\\\", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included a simple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256 color GIF image into a buffer.  I also wrote a quick'n'dirty(tm) demo program that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three \\\"windows\\\".

Maybe they're just UNLUCKY.  If a rapist pulls a woman into an alley in Boston, chances are almost certain that she won't be counted  as one of those self-defenders because our local constabulary didn't consider it important that she be allowed to arm herself.  Even though the shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the \\\"gun owner\\\" column.   Ironic words for somebody who lives in Florida.  The \\\"average threat level\\\" in Florida has been REDUCED by a liberal CCW policy.  It's well known that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because  they are less likely to be carrying than your natives.  Come on up to Boston, or NYC, or Washington DC, and see how much diddlysquat the  \\\"average threat level in the country\\\" means to a resident there.   Sometimes this works.  Sometimes it just lands your good neighbors  on the dance card for the next wave of drive-bys.  Someone here once told a story about LA gangs moving into Phoenix.  I've misplaced the original text, but the story started with one resident calling the  cops on a gang member.  Sure enough, a few nights later, there was a  drive-by performed at the resident's house.  Except that this time, unlike in LA, the entire street came out and returned fire, putting an end to the car's occupants.  The gang packed up and left.  Of course, in LA, or in a place like Florida after the hurricane, your first problem is to FIND an officer to step up to and tell anything.   Look, nobody is arguing this.  I have a fire extinguisher at home.   That doesn't mean I can be careless about tossing my burnt matches  on the carpet.  I live carefully, monitor the woodstove, get my flue cleaned twice a year, and test my smoke alarms annually.  But if -- DESPITE all this -- a fire does start, it's too late for any of these things EXCEPT the extinguisher.   You seem to be agreeing with your opponent.  You can't trust your government to protect you from abusers and violators -- white-collar, blue-collar, epauletted, or tank-shirted.  Ultimately, no one has the power to enforce your \\\"rights\\\" but you.  Unless you've given up that  power.   Too many people fit that category, that is true.  Some of us like to believe that they are uninterested in the facts behind the case for gun  ownership because they've been conditioned to believe that there AREN'T  any.  You seem content to underestimate the electorate; I'm willing to try to raise their consciousness.   I think we can.  HCI was founded in what, 1980?  In the mid-80's, they ran a \\\"One  Million Strong!\\\" campaign for two years before reaching this goal.   My understanding is that they \\\"reached\\\" it by the stratagem of including wide classes of people other than dues-paying members.  (I can't speak authoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they started running a \\\"Two Million Strong!\\\" campaign for a while -- but they let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they simply were never going to reach that level of membership.  In 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting point of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.   By 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had  about a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it the third largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA). And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historical figures from Kukla's \\\"Gun Control,\\\" pp. 61 and 420.)  As you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused by their T-bones and MTV.  That leaves hard-core gun-owners against  hard-core gun banners.  I know a number of ex-HCI members who have recently become NRA members. I've never heard of a single one who has gone the other way.  Yes, I think we can and will win this one.   I think they would be used far less to hammer nails, as well, but, like you, I can't give any citation showing that this utilization is CURRENTLY significant at more than an anecdotal level.

If we  unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity,  we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we  encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with  Christianity and reject what isn't.      We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine  the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch  and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.   Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our  lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and  service.  The command to love God with all one's mind means no fuzzy- headed drifting from idea to idea.    One Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope.  It is a frequent theme  in his writings.  Indeed, thoughtful Christians from most traditions  recognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of Christians.  It  too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith.

You are not being asked to incrimidate yourself (e.g., \\\"where did you bury the body?\\\"); you are being asked to provide information necessary to execute a legal search warrant.  Refusing to provide the password is akin to refusing to provide a key to a storage locker... except that they could always _force_ their way into the locker.

Following up on software availability of NAPLPS supporting software I find that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being PP3 which runs soley on MSDOS machines leaving Mac and Amiga users to buy full commercial software if they want to try out the BBS (I know I wouldn't)  Next most interesting possibility is to port MGR to PC, Mac, Amiga. I know there is an old version of a Mac port on bellcore.com that doesn't work under System 7 But I can't seem to find the source anywhere to see if I can patch it.  Is there a color version of MGR for Linux?  I know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year but I misplaced it.  Does anyone on this group know if MGR as been ported to PC or Amiga ? I can't seem to send a message to the MGR channel without it bouncing.  Does anyone have any other suggestions for a Linux based GUI BBS ?\",\" (1)  Stephen said you took a quote out of context (2)  You noted that Stephen had not replied to some other t.r.m article      (call it A) that took a quote out of context (3)  But the lack of evidence for X does not constitute evidence for the      lack of X  (a common creationist error) (4)  So the fact that Stephen did not reply to A does not justify the      conclusion that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in A (5)  You asked Stephen to explain why you were wrong and they were OK,      or to acknowledge that he was being a hypocrite.   (6)  Both of the choices you give Stephen assume that he condoned      taking quotes out of context in A. (7)  I assumed you were being logical, and that the sentence that begins      \\\"Could you please explain ...\\\" was not a nonsequitur, but was intended      to follow from the sentence that preceded it.

Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it (as long as my advisor doesn't catch me - which is easy enough to do), but  stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review  committees and the peer review process in general.  In today's world that's  what determines what science is: what gets funded.  And a damn good thing to. Flights of fantasy just don't have much chance of producing anything, at  least not in biomedical research.  The surest way for a graduate student to ruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with  fleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a project that actually has a good chance of producing some results.  MD's seem to  be particularly prone to this aberrant behavior.     I have to agree with Gary Merrill's response to this.  I've read alot of the Alu and middle repetitive sequence work and it's really very interesting,  good work with implications for many fields in molecular genetics.

If  you asked  somone,  who  had never heard of hockey before, if LA played in the Smythe division what do you think  that  the  response  would  be? What  if you asked this person if LA played in the West division?  The naming of  divisions  after  long-dead  entrepreneurs  is  unnecessary obfuscation.    Hardly.  The \\\"established\\\" situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al. The  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team could successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  did was formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop- olistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth- er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly debatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de- bate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made, however, is that people played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smythe and his pals showed up.   What's wrong with best defenceman, period?  Was there  ever  a  better defenceman?   Was  there  ever a better player?

If you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent.  However, if a professional thief wants your vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:  1) ignition kill or fuel cut-off 2) a flashing red LED  These two are basic to a decent alarm system.   To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock.

No = : reasonable alternative exists. =  = I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime;  = causes precede their effects.   And I must concede here.  Cause *before* effect, implies time, time is part of spacetime.  Hense, the argument would be valid.  I could return and say  that this does not infer the cause and effect relationship being *unique* to *this* spacetime, but I won't 8^), because the point is moot.  Doesn't address why (which Petri Pikho addresses below).

All of which require something we Christians readily admit to: ``Faith''.  The fact that there are several candidates belies that *none* are conclusive.   With out conclusive evidence, we are left with faith.  It could even be argued that one of these hypotheses may one day be proven (as best as a non-repeatable event can be \\\"proven\\\").  But I ask, what holds   someone *today* to the belief that any or all of them are correct, except by  faith?  [ a couple of paragraphs deleted.  Summary: we ask \\\"Why does the universe exist\\\" ]  = I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely =  = 1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists? =  = and =  = 2) How did the universe emerge from nothing? =  = It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question.

Hence, we *have* religions.  = The question \\\"why anything exists\\\" can be countered by = demanding answer to a question \\\"why there is nothing in nothingness, = or in non-existence\\\".  Actually, both questions turn out to be = devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist = don't exist. Tautology at its best.  Carefully examine the original question, and then the \\\"counter-question\\\".  The first asks \\\"Why\\\", while the second is a request for definition.  It  doesn't address why something does or does not exist, but asks to define  the lack of existence.  The second question is unanswerable indeed, for how do we identify something as \\\"nothing\\\" (aren't they mutually exclusive terms)?.  How do we identify a state of non-existence (again, this is nearing the limits of this simple layman's ability to comprehend, and I would appreciate an explanation).   I might add, the worldview of \\\"Things that exist do, and things that don't...don't\\\" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable, as does the theist's belief in God.  It is based on the assumption that there is *not* a reason for being, something as ultimately (un)supportable as the position of there being a reason.  Its very foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there *is* a reason.  We come to this. Either \\\"I am, therefore I am.\\\", or \\\"I am for a reason.\\\" If the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are satisfied, and need not a doctor.

First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is = actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and = them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.  Agreed.  It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as well.  = Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence. = This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God = Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence, = it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always = existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.  This does not preclude His existence.  It only seeks to identify His *qualities* (implying He exists to *have* qualities, BTW).  = The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable = of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not = accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.  Like the theist, we come to a statement of faith, for this position assumes  that the evidence at hand is conclusive.  Note, I am not arguing against  scientific endeavor, for science is useful for understanding the universe in which we exist. But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective.  I seek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the Creator.  I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer \\\"why\\\".   It appears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting that 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an answer.    = : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \\\"why\\\".  That isn't = : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural). =  = This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \\\"how\\\", = not why, something happens.

Why did pre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.  But we come to the admission that science fails to answer \\\"Why?\\\".  Because it can't be answered in the realm of modern science, does that make the question invalid? = : I don't believe *any* = : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite = : having all of the parts available.

I suppose we would do the same thing as when Galileo or Capernicus was  *vindicated*  (before someone starts jumping up and down screaming \\\"Inquisition!\\\", note I said *vindicated*.  I certainly hope we've gotten beyond the \\\"shooting the messenger\\\" stage).  M. Pihko does present a good point though.  We may need to ask \\\"What do I  as an individual Christian base my faith on?\\\"  Will it be shaken by the production of evidence that shatters our \\\"sacred cows\\\" or will we seek to understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God *said* (and continues to say) in his Word?  \\\"Why do I ask why?\\\" (apologies to Budweiser and company 8^]).  Jason.   \",\"      There are some issues which come to mind when one considers the law enforcement aspects of the use of the Big Brother (Clipper) chip.      The drug dealers and terrorists aren't going to let themselves be caught by using this type of encryption.  In 1985 the New York Times reported that government investigators broke up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to eavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest them.      A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said \\\"There are a lot of medium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the signals intelligence operation of this group.\\\"      For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure communications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip will only increase their numbers.      Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the use of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional and civil liberties questions involved.      For example, in some areas of the world torture is used as an investigative tool by the local \\\"law-enforcement\\\" people.  I suspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and shortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep the conviction rate high.      The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country (even with a court order obtained by showing \\\"probable cause\\\") is because we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and what is ethically and morally right.      I think that the same question of expediency versus morality should come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  I vote for morality.      I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat to prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is not put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the White House press release I came away with that impression.      To most of the American public, the word \\\"hacker\\\" has rightly or wrongly come to mean \\\"high tech adolescent vandal\\\". It has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt regarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who have genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues surrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother does not become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.  I would hate to see this become some kind of high tech Volstead Act.      The high speed digital communications revolution is coming at us with the speed of an SST.  The times they are a changing, and just as IBM is learning that they can't do business the same way they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe NSA should evaluate another approach.      EFF, who have correctly questioned the cryptographic strength of Big Brother, may need to send a stronger message out regarding the constitutional issues involved.      Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more.      And as for Dorothy Elizabeth Robling Denning: En quoi cela vous concerne, cheri? \",\"Yo, did anybody see this run of HARD COPY?

Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and there's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate position on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the Bible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been known specifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a cesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes, homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action described.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about as many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of guests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically about homosexuality.  In the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom 1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil. Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about idolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at least result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this passage.  It does not use the word \\\"homosexuality\\\", and it is referring to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality. So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality. But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway, that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards  homosexuality.  The other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim 1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used here mean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning, such as \\\"wanton\\\", and that another may be specifically \\\"male prostitute\\\".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching about homosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul shared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.  Jude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  The context in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in Sodom were angels, it seems likely that \\\"strange flesh\\\" refers to intercourse with angels.  As you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion is determined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that the passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OT prohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT endorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and no clear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in Rom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly do the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is legitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his background and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.  This is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long dissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it's clear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down to is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This appears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as a whole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today. This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference between Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both sides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the other side will finally come to their senses.  That makes things very frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic outcome is not very likely...\",\"hi folks i have 2 hd first is an seagate 130mb the second a cdc 340mb (with a future domain no ram) i'd like to change my 2 controller ide & scsi and buy a new one with ram (at least 1mb) that could controll  all of them any companies? how many $? and is it possible via hw or via sw select how divide the ram cache for 2 hd?

So in sum and to beat a dead horse:  (1) When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of absorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength, the cone outputs are _indistinguishable_.  (2) Cones are simply detectors with different spectral sensitivities and are not any more \\\"color sensitive\\\" than are rods, ommatidia or other photoreceptors.  (3) Color vision arises because outputs of receptors which sample different parts of the spectrum (cones in this case) are \\\"processed centrally\\\".

NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there is no problem building an expansion box.

If you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine.  The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle (even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of the law is no excuse - they will get you too!  It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors.  Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \\\"no way!\\\"  But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one, and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.  Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.  For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave enlightment may be necessary.  So, the questions are -   What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?   Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by   a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector   antenna?   Are any brands \\\"quieter\\\" than others?\",\":  : I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it, : and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part : in the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even  : suggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the : context of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda,  : as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proof : might be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requests : for sufficient fire power.  :  : Important dates:  : Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban. : Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.     :  : On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon : ban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senate : in N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have : an Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons stated : agenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or : some: group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were : initially : at the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent  : on \\\"Street Stories\\\" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to \\\"get  : ready fast\\\", as \\\"they know we are coming\\\". I believe this attack continued,  : even tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top  : down. After the N.J. assembly vote, the ATF had a limited amount of time to : come up with something, and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely. :  : ...rich       I don't know Rich. Last year when the congress was debating the Bushmans 'Crime Bill', the incident at Lubys' cafe occured. Most of the anti-gun crap was amended out of the bill anyway.          Could a president 'order': go find some 'assault weapons' and bring the media\\\". I hope not.  Frankly, the Toon-meister* scares me. Of course  having a Democratic majority in congress doesn't help.

[...]  Translation:  It doesn't support the Nick Szabo Vision of the Future to Which You MUST Subscribe...  Fred, we're all supporting what each of us thinks should be done, to some degree.  If you have a problem with what Nick thinks should be done, address it, instead of just complaining about his doing so.  You really don't get what the 'complaints' are about, do you?   [not incredibly clear explanation of complaints...something between    feelings regarding Nick's method, and judgments about his meaning]  T  F  *** Fred's issue #1;  Nick's alleged trashing of others ***  I only got it when you stopped trashing, and made your point patently, instead of 'allegorically'.  That was my point all along, Fred.      I see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last point.  Why don't you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective point-of-view?  And, as usual, you defend your insults with \\\"he started it.\\\"  \\\"Yeah, I took some of his research and called it my own, but he started it.\\\"  \\\"So what if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first.\\\"  Besides that, I think it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it. So your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.  Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  \\\"I never borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you gave it to me.\\\"  Make up yer mind, Fred!      First, I try to address what I think you meant, for which I am rewarded with a denial of sorts, and a smart remark.  Then, I point out that I am not clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly interpreting you a second time, and I'm stupid for it.  I just can't win, can I, Fred?  You've got a great point here somewhere, it's just that between stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.   *** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning ***  Too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or you would have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had.  My reading of what Nick actually said is that \\\"people aren't required in all parts of all space processes\\\", so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program, I read as \\\"People are required in all parts of all space processes.\\\"  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'm so patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat your terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)  The point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'd only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's your job, Fred.  And, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points, simultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan' that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone.   No, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts made you imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even though it's no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone as dense as myself.      Of course, Socrates.  How could it be otherwise?   Who cares who came on the net first?  If you do, consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years. If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I went down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It's just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's no worse than your own.  Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical, while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling isn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might see it better, Fred.  \\\"Net.ghod wannabe\\\"?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted my motivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as your insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to impress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a jerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands. Alas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried to communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.  Well, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I'll never be able to get a(nother) job with NASA, since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall.  Well, I just hope you're happy.  Please leave me alone, now.  I just don't have the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me.

When the Arabs lost, Israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as citizens.  What would you have done?  Let them in so they could kill Jews?  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens  because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave.  Of course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is impossible.  Therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the country.   No kibbutz that I have ever visited has any \\\"employees\\\" unless they had to hire some people for the restaurants, hotels etc if there weren't enough  people ON the kibbutz to do them.  In such cases, they are paid properly. If a kibbutz turns away an Arab, 9I have never seen or heard of this) but it reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz, not the whole kibbutz movement.   This just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli politics.  Although the  major parties in Israel aren't religious (however not totally secular), due to the format of the government (coalition) the religious parties have always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition. In fact, from what I heard the present government is the least influenced by the religious parties in the existance of Israel.  Israel CANNOT be called a secular state.  For instace, Haifa is the only city in the country (except for maybe some Arab cities) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath.   There are many other examples of religion in Israel.  Marriages in Israel are NOT contolled by the state, but by Rabbis and Priests.  Obviously your  disbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country you claim to know so much about.

I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published  solutions to it.   The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw  the object we   1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively  computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume  that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not  exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable  measure. 2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment  of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two  triangles which will be filled in to color the surface. 3) Depth sort the triangles 4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw  and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is  along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge  colored with a special \\\"edge color\\\"   It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface. The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated. They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area.\",\"------------------------------------------------------------------------- One reason that the WHA abandoned the blue puck was the fact that it crumbled very quickly during play.

Personally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays, or at least been among the leaders.   Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just one base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.   Wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed. The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays. Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years.   Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances. The Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls in the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great on defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first.   Wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on defense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers some runs.  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average. I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw seem to have come out of theirs.\",\"      You know, I never really appreciated them before!  \",\"jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu:     Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.  It would not    be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be    local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill    AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.    High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but    the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun    - and would pay through the nose for it.  Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude, homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of killing German soldiers for their guns.  Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible. The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel tubing, hand tools and a welder.  I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown locally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I think the demand for \\\"real\\\" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have firearms, and \\\"bad guys\\\" will continue to have access to them, one way or another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation.\",\"I received the following two notes from Martin Hellman with details on how Clipper will work.  They are posted with his permission.  The implications of some details are fascinating.  ------- Date: Sat, 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT From: \\\"Martin Hellman\\\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu> To: (a long list of recipients) Subject: Clipper Chip   Most of you have seen the announcement in Friday's NY Times, etc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology) announcing the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" crypto device. Several messges on the net have asked for more technical details, and some have been laboring under understandable misunderstandings given the lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out is your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday to get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing details. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this to Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my facts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know if I have anything wrong):  The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in  Silicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the  same for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit  specific. I don't know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will  call them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message.  The IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so  that the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that  they also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion,  it may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key  will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1  and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow  authorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be  decided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that  they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they  must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased.  When a law enforcement agency gets a court order, they will  present it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and  K2, thereby allowing access to the unit key UK.  In addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his  or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key  plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be  encrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK,  and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part  message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK  producing       E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}  When a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law  enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information  flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that  they may do this constantly on all links, with or without a  court order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links  over which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to        E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number  in the above message. They then check the serial number  of the unit and see if it is on the \\\"watch list\\\" for which they  have a court order. If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K,  and then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M.  I am still in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do  not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed  scheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme  more knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court  order worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not  necessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were  needed, one per escrow authority. While no explanation is needed, the following story adds some color: In researching some ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around, I spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law expert here at Stanford and he related the following story: When Edward Levi became Pres. Ford's attorney general (right after Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent asking for \\\"the wiretap authorizations.\\\" When Levy asked for the details so he could review the cases as required by law, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned over 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not comply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear:  No single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personal keys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi and sometimes a John Mitchell.

All the protected equipment is ALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual  condition of also having them on charge.  If the power fails, big deal -  the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but  there's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it  takes a while).  If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter, why not do it all the time?  Then there'd be no switchover to screw things up, and no having to sense the failure fast.

Fixed disk sectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is quite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached, the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance, and it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more loss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence.  The floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the CPU for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr, by the way) really does stink.\",\"1.

The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence-- God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree, Science.   My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations, for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone. Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have  children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that is made possible.   People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death, and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world.   This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely  prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary  alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,   go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us?   I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not, but I will say this:  Before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body they have been given, they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to  believe their search is displeasing to God.\",\"  Why must it be a US Government Space Launch Pad?

Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence \\\"ESC [ 1 B 7\\\"  would indicate that the \\\"HOME\\\" key was pressed, with the shift key down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such as \\\"shift-Return\\\".  If anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code in the source file \\\"x11term.c\\\".  Maybe if someone at OSF is  interested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about  emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods  somewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.  Notes:    * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create    its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which     includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.   * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2    [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].

I wrote that human brains \\\"are infested with sin\\\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.    Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your conscience is properly formed?  The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the formed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure that your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation can be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll grant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.  Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be certain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is `properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)   Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:   The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation? How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or another -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?  You write:   But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I am confident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way from `confident'.  This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain (really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is significantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that you are confident, that invites people to ask why.  Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely certain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any idea of his own fallibility.   I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of them -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible. The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.   Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu  [This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the original criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong answers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal consequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is at least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that -- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are fallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these basic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's unlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of confidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for example said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell, and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and intolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's some chance I'm wrong.  Don't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant Christians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least some cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger. If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for certain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I think it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that way.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most difficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell what I think is the truth.\",\"Does anyone out there know of any products using Motorola's Neuron(r) chips MC143150 or MC143120.

Actions : prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  A good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews says that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated through his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).  Reading Abraham's ``biography'' in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man beset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his wife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by copulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the basis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of  faith'' in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared Abraham as a man of faith. He believed God's promises.  This gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through works, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in performing works.  ``Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit.''

There are other animals on this planet with advanced  mental facilities which have not developed \\\"religion\\\" as a  satisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?   Further, it appears that only humans have a \\\"need\\\" to explain the  unexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,  including those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly  content in their ignorance.   I'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me  from your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal  *only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need  not be researched; 3) religion was \\\"made up\\\" by humans to address a  perceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that  is, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical  structure with biology at the apex).   Needless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the  underlying presuppositions.    I disagree that Christianity is \\\"an infectious cult\\\".  It has  certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in  spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.  That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is  \\\"infectious\\\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides  a workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this  is the case).   I disagree that Christianity is \\\"a safety blanket\\\" which supplants  hope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one  Source of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a  Christian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to  you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose  and externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of  control over one's own life the problem or is it something else?   Finally, one does not appropriate \\\"eternal happiness\\\" by following  Christian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance  of Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people  from their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the  Christian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian  in the Person of God's Spirit.   Heaven is one of two final states that  Christian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally  not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this  promised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived  benefits to them in the here-and-now.    Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a  priority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this  as a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate  priority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,  convert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).  Rather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting  the opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits  of a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful  that it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask  \\\"Why?\\\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-  plished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it  does not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian  is required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of  friendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot  evaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or  harm others if the sole purpose of being a \\\"friend\\\" is to gain a  conversion).   As a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-  ticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \\\"hurry-up\\\"  attitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no  conversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was  coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open  to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).  The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings  conviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part  (witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.    We are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die  just as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more  than this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is  so limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find  a more expansive view.   (For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing  arts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language  of other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?  How is it that humans can organize themselves in various social  structures whereas other animals have only one structure?)    Blatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.  Christianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not  a *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship  with a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-  knit relationship with this appelation.    There are \\\"Jesus freaks\\\" who let the emotional aspects of worship  and Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,  this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these  things flow.    Guilty by association?

But apparently this is regarded as an *extreme* example of a \\\"non-rational\\\" process in science whereby a successful hypothesis was proposed.  But how non-rational is it?  Of course we can't hope (currently at least) to explain how or why Kekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails. Surely it wasn't the *only* daydream he had.  What was special about *this* one?  Could it have had something to do with a perceived *analogy* between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning geometry of molecules?  Is such analogical reasoning \\\"extra-scientific\\\"? Or is it rather at the very heart of science (Perice's notion of abduction, the use of models within and across disciplines)?

She was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to Original Sin, but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life.

She is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to God, and everything that flows from that relationship.  The Catholic Church sees her as the new Eve.

The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.  Joe Buehler  ...  Schism and Disobedience  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.  The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend \\\"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\\\"  It adds that \\\"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\\\"Not only does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \\\"We pray for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy.\\\"  ...  Intrinsically Schismatic?  The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response.  It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The first part deals with \\\"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church\\\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church.  But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" which is entitled \\\"Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise\\\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is Canon 1382, which reads: \\\"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the Holy See.\\\"  The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder.  I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church.  Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to      The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not     in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with     offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses     against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are     apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a     pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the     exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the     consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh     Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated     he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because     there was no intention of a breach with the Church.  ....  It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy, and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.  Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February 1989 Remnant merits careful study:\",\"  Actually, it's HAPP, and some of their equipment can be found in the  Parts Express catalog (1-800-338-0531).

Although two months  have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I  have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at   almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from  Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly  slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to  save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful  events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then  taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people   well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these  places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.  They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the  Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality  problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers  who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and  Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the   Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.   I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is   destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are   speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as   well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is   proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.\\\"                                                       Dr. Stephan Eshnanie  Serdar Argic\",\"                  What's the difference between Nolan Ryan and Yount?

A technician examined it and  pronounced the disk drive unusable.  My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides). When CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.  I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.  Install will proceed \\\"successfully\\\", but when I try to boot the server, it reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware.  Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is one disk drive (or at least one large single unit).   Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready errors.  Questions: ========= The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes?   So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?  1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what is causing my serialisation error? 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of which has failed? 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive? 4. What else can cause a serialisation error? 5. What happens if the keycard fails? 6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments and guides.  Thanks for your time.

THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD      Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most      important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God.       Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should      be to know God.      I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three      Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the      Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I      believe that they are individual Persons who are one in      nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each      possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also      equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.      Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.  II.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.      A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for          Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and          unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without          ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.      B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.      C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.          As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,          patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;          Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.      D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely          without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of          sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.          6:3.      E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time          in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all          knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,          infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with          unlimited power over all creation).          God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It          is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day          has become very man-centered, and that the people in our          churches know very little about God.  I believe that the          Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the          people of God need to understand that God is sovereign          in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives          of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes          regarding salvation.  III.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.      A.  In creation           All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in           creating, and all Three are active in sustaining           creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs           (for nations as well as individual people) to the end           of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;           Heb. 1:3.      B.  In salvation          In order to understand salvation I believe that it is          absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man.           All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,          active in salvation.          1.  God, the Father              Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the              Godhead determined in eternity past that there would              be salvation, the conditions under which people              could and would be saved, and even who would be              saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in              Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph              1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.          2.  Christ, the Son of God              The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the              virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two              important works:              a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of                   God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.              b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the                   Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on                   the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by                   His present intercessory work in heaven.  The                   work of salvation will be completed for us when                   the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-                   4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.          3.  The Holy Spirit              As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is              Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is              carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the              following ways:              a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11              b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new                   birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.              c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work                   of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.              d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making                    salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14.              e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of                   Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13              f.   He teaches every believer the truth of                   Scripture. Cf. John 14:26.              g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of                    God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12              h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26.              i.   He empowers for living and for service.                     Cf. Acts 1:8  \",\": : Seems to me Koresh is yet another messenger that got killed : : for the message he carried.

The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the controller card, then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main memory where it's needed.

Heck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about ISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE drives.  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus, and if IDE did DMA there would be trouble.  (BTW, there are DMA-enabling signals in the IDE cable spec, but the last report I heard was that they are never implemented, because it would require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers.)\",\"Clinton has backed off from the $16 billion jobs bill.

'Good' neighborhoods form groups  like 'crime-watch' to increase this effect, and the relative  effectiveness of the police.

About a dozen Weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the courthouse.

We are doing a bible study (at my college) on Revelations.  We have been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonable interpretation.

I believe the beast is the Antichrist (some may differ but it seems obvious) and the woman represents Babylon which stands for Rome or the Roman Catholic Church.

It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!  It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at .238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game and giving up 6.6/game.   Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo,  Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay, the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen is a big question mark.

Thanks.\",\"My turn to jump in! :)   I think you mean circular, not recursive, but that is semantics. Recursiveness has no problems, it is just horribly inefficient (just ask any assembly programmer.)   The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights, is a complete lie and deception, as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving.  Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost,  almost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable? Similarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to save another, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?   That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty,  especially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable, the serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line, those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be able to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people's life and/or liberty, but is not his own life/liberty inviolate also?  According to the declaration of independence, it is.   Oooh, I like that.  It means that killing an infant is not murder because it cannot be against its will.  Reason, an infant has no will as such.  Similarly for people who are brain dead (easier to see), in a coma, etc.  Also, under current law, accidental killing is still murder.  How will you include that?   The only real golden rule in life is, he who has the gold, makes the rules.  I.e. Might Makes Right.  That is survival.  Now what is wrong with that?   If you mean the golden rule as I stated, yes, almost every system as implemented has used that in reality.  Sorry, I don't deal as much in fiction, as I do in reality.

The distinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people, not people whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these soldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. And resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters). Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by resistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the hostile occupiers in WWII.

The name of the company is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them).     Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.     His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:   - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use    the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.   - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone    devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.    This stuck them as strange, until now...      Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several concerns over the new Clipper Chip:    - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.    - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto     system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency     of the government.    - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm     is vulnerable over time to an attacker.    - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that     it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or     changing the keys themselves.    - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and     money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed     engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very     difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique     to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is     hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.  Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet. However he told me a little:   - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been    granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is    secure.   - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.    The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret    until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate    the following:      - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but       Mr. Melnick stated \\\"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\\\")      - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.      - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).      - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that       it is _adujustable_ and is \\\"More than adequate for security.\\\"      - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and       can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which       is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I       consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.      - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques       such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the       hardware chip.      - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars       for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced       enough, which probably won't happen]).      - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm       and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted       data into \\\"blocks.\\\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know       what the block header is. This program operates at all supported       RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.      - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!    Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of business. This is a very real possibility.

EDT                     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you  in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking  part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.              You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas  Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to  mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he  has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all  followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education  here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according  to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational  system.              His philosophy of government, his belief in the  importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest  here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us  President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in  the Chamber of Commerce studios.                Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for  taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite  network and we welcome you here this evening.              Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.   And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening  also.              I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure  many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that  you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In  Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.              I believe the President has a few words that he might  want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that  at this time.  It's great to have you.              THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.              I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob  Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the  Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making,  along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine  tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people  from school to the work place.              I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts,  recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this  economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to  work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to  make things happen.              This satellite town meeting is a good example of that  kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home  state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart  Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing  several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I  appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all  the rest of you.              I have tried as hard as I could to move toward  constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about  this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson  believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in  education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion,  freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and  third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.                If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this  beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful  cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change  with changing times.              For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit  and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we  can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless  we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in  government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase  our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the  long run.              We also have to have people who can carry their load.   And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven  or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system  and continues into the work force where education must go on for a  lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can  learn.              And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing  we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership  between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the  private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're  trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that  would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many  thousands that have a strong education component so our young people  can be learning and working at the same time.              Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good  place we can begin, I think, the discussion.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.              Each month we get together and talk about ways that all  citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And  tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours  can prepare students for this world of work.              This week, the Education Department and the Labor  Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called  Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.   The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's  proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched  jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged  areas of the country.                Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it  somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls  for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your  words is that so important?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.   First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may  have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want  them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to  continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of  research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may  forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year  over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for  schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already  taught before.              Secondly, we want to help these young people progress,  not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to  abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is  learning because we think that the best and most productive workers  will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience  could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to  succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are  disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go  into the next year, is really even greater.                Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs  throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this  educational component of training.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr.  Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer  or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with  education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people,  for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning  geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or  working on something, and they can see the exact and direct  application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a  lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between  education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.   It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of  young people even beyond the summer.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.                Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship  program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell  us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it  developing.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why  it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade  will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will  require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people  get in a high school diploma.                If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries  of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school  education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young  people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not  go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because  they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their  employers.              So we think America has a big economic interest in  trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school  but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes  two years of further training either in a community college, a  vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in  this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some  funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states  and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in  a way that would be customized essentially by the business community,  based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could  revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and  the earnings of American workers.              SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think  you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the  people watching this program -- that the business community and  educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many  of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In  fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The  people watching this program probably are the ones who are most  directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley  and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes  already out there.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight  about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning   career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal  with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of  these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and  you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much  longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business  community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're  doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The  Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these  kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've  aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.              The business community is going to be actively engaged  in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and  helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions  develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.              Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is  one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these  players in a community come together and work together and cooperate  together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and  the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody  is talking, but they're not really working together in a common  strategy.              And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick,  would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic  excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a  tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to  make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be  eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year  college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're  talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation  skills for on-the-job learning.              And again, those are the critical components.  It's  already being done.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one  point based on my personal experience at home -- the business  community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are  the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught,  but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort  of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are  going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the  second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and  influence them.  So I think that's very important.              And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at  the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some  funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make  sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the  quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to  determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.              SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of  course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery  program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about  long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr.  President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the  communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be  coming forth before too long.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I  were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public  schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that  a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.                I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals  that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President  Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to  do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in  Congress that will actually define the things that the national  government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the  children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those  goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school  ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school  graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are  confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are  second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe,  disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took  them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of  life-long learning in this country.              And each one of those goals there's a national role, a  state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector  role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to  introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is;  and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job  is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality  that we need to meet.              It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite  like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.   Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their  money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and  partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really  it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms  of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to  support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform  efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.              Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to  the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of  course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and  I wonder if you would comment on that.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of  our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they  don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system  of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had  national skill standards to which they could aspire and which  employers would understand as a national credential, many of these  young people would actually find that they were much more eligible  for jobs.              Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other  countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to  college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain  technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If  you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to  develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working  with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private  industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the  kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other  institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go  ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce  Todd of Austin, Texas.              Q   Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and  Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We  have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who  have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me  simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with  much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are  very supportive.                We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our  summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to  have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much  as 3,500 with the federal assistance.                Much of the question that we had designed you have  answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But  the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day  would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round  is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal  level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the  local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's  something that we believe is very important to success in this  effort.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to  answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling,  and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.   I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.                First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can  structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer  program and that will move a lot of these young people back into  schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in  the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to  try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs  to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're  working on that.              Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the  Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to  build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job  training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give  heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you  asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we  hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being  trained on a year-round basis.              And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said  a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen  as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people  actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when  they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we  hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and  we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget  cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue  raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be  able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.              Bob, do you want to say anything?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out  of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing,  and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high  school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in  addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of  jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.   It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the  economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything  else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I  think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I  think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or  greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going  to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything  right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000  will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into  next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it  will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working  together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And  then the state, with all the various school districts, a very  important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I  think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that  moving.              The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.                Doctor?              Q   Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to  be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school  and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since  its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two  alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages  we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an  extremely effective learning strategy.              And over the years, we've come to believe that there are  several principles that are very important in bridging the school and  work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with  practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure  to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect  upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and  lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the  development of high performance competencies.                My question, then is:  How can the general education  faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with  transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies  can you suggest to achieve this integration?              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think --  and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting  work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next  guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists    in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to  them and we can discuss it later.              You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?              THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one  thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as  clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the  people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more  explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics  is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish  what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is  vocational learning and what is academic learning.              I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think  we should have a strong component for people who are in the  vocational program.              SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to  rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and  work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're  important for all students.  It's not just a special group of  students that needs them.              Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United  States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream  experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and  12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience  and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on  to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they  can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and  career directions.              But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often  goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom, within our schools.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's  going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I  think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank  you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and  your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \",\"The Clipper Chip will have no effect.

Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced to give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike Foligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy Ruff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who retired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it? After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit. Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in reverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'm not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit and Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know if the captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he played for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)  Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded, almost, unless you're a franchise player. \",\"Excerpts from netnews.alt.atheism: 15-Apr-93 Re: thoughts on christians by Dave Fuller@portal.hq.vi  I think it'd help if we got a couple good atheists (or even some good, steadfast agnostics) in some high political offices.

Religion in general provides a nice patch for some human weaknesses; Organized religion provides a nice way to keep a population under control.    Blech.  Chris  \",\"     From what I read, the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together over the phone.  The bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type, so to put a (I assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together from instructions _over the phone_ (!) one must need some brains I would expect.    I read this in an article in \\\"The Australian Muslim Times\\\", the newspaper (weekly) of the Australian Muslim community.    If this is true, perhaps one of the Muslims based in North America (if they see this posting) can elaborate.       I don't deny this fact.  The thrust of my argument here is that   (a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.  (b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important  distinction.  I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \\\"Muslim\\\".  In general, anyone who calls themselves a \\\"Muslim\\\" and does not do or  outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam is considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to Islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a Muslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential principles, though, then one does leave Islam.  The term \\\"Muslim\\\" is to be contrasted with \\\"Mu'min\\\", which means \\\"true believer\\\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is something known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you will not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism, because it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I, for example, am a \\\"true believer\\\" or not.  For example, I could just be putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \\\"Muslims\\\" we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in practice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By \\\"Muslim\\\" we do not necessarily mean \\\"Mu'min\\\", or \\\"true believer\\\" in Islam.\",\"GRE software for MS-DOS, from StudyWare. original disk, manual.

Anthony Fauci, director of the  U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said,  \\\"We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly  can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will  get around microbial resistance.\\\"  He said any delay would signify questions  over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  Fauci, who co- authored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the   argument by one of his co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new  discovery  indicates that \\\"$1 billion spent on vaccine trials\\\" has been \\\"a waste of time  and money\\\" because the trials were started  too long after the patients were  infected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College of  Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument  for  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.

This finding  supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of  contracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the  JAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive  surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies  were conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and  Florida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and  tested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found  that none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an   HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.

The OAM is a small division of  the NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10  billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available  research grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be  available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for  Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid  to become involved in AIDS.  \\\"They have to look successful and there is no  easy answer in AIDS,\\\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the  OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening,  such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an  advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS  community was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists'  general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic  will be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \\\"The OAM advisory  panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It   will take them several years to accept the nature of research.\\\"    Nevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator  at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \\\"Here is a  wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.

Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus- 6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack  causes the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in  the immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a  factor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research   found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte,  which is the primary target of HIV.

Scientists previously knew that the natural  killer cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's   research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural  killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony  L. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube  findings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the  body.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor   molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface  receptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that  herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.       ======================================================================                                    April 15, 1993       ====================================================================     \\\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\\\" Journal of the  American Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert,  George and Nordenberg, Dale F.)        All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only  ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health  problems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert  and Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana,  Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,   respectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care  about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for  the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should  be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it  is not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many   respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic  development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.   Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have  on many developing countries, and the increased need for international  assistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political  aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there  is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach  to international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in  particular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \\\"Earth in the  Balance\\\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable  international development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child  survival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the  developing  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically   change the future of worldwide health.  ====================================================================    \\\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\\\" Journal of the American   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth)        Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible  before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less  attention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller  Foundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and  Nordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as  malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited   economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention  than they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is  receiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most  developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic  diseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another  year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS  and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden  but financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a  rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each  individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley  says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and   economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he  concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the  United States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries  with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic   has been the rule.

The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90  children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV- infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease.   HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \\\"a  hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected  children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\\\"   Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \\\"is  the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay  disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\\\"  If these  vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their  therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in  the United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health  Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide.   The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which  funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial  at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the  ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development.   Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows  that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers  know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease.   The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined  closely for other reasons as well.  \\\"This trial will provide the first insight  into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\\\" said  Daniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  \\\"We need this  information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent  HIV infection in children.\\\"   In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city  areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic.   Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during  pregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than  a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing  numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection  drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding  increase in the numbers of infected children.   HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.   The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV  develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These  infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of  childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms  leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays.   At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger  to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older  participants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no  symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen  liver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune- regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study.   Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical  School, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of  Medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical  officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS.   \\\"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children  for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or  fevers, for example, than another,\\\" said Dr. McNamara.  \\\"We'll also look at  whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other  significant laboratory or clinical effects.\\\"   He emphasized that the small  study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  products.   The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from  recombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically  engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well- tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults.   One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a  protein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.   Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is  the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug  Administration.   Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco  and the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in  Emeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus  adjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine  contains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in  other Phase I vaccine trials in adults.   A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15  children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the  experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone,  considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will  be told what they receive.   If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the  experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will  begin.   Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six  months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

They report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling  skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the  HIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals'  immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV  itself caused the skin disease.   Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease  without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the  National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues  described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human  Retroviruses.   Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most  animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this  problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for  HIV as well as their own genetic material.   NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse  eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters  contained both normal and transgenic animals.   Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV  genetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon  after birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an  incomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer.   Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their  necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin  lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No  skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates.   Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a  type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can  cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the  animals.   Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the  presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.    HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \\\"turned  on,\\\" or active, said Dr. Kopp.   The scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the  mice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common  infections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune  systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the  skin lesions, Dr. Kopp said.   Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists  exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV  genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.   Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the  genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No  lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light.   The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter  Dickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases.   Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs.  Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR;  Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney,  formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.

Shalala today announced the first nationwide  clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care  professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV  infection or AIDS.       The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a  physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on  drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is  funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of  San Francisco General Hospital.       Secretary Shalala said, \\\"One goal of this project is to share expertise  so patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health  care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces  treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and  community social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients  with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\\\"       Secretary Shalala said, \\\"This clinical expertise should be especially  helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in  communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\\\"       The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and  it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST)  Monday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer  questions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and  health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be  answered as quickly as possible.       Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question  related to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment  information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral,  literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health  care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate  sources of information or materials.       When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken  by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse  practitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and  inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant  asks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current  medications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history.       This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern  California.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health  Professions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and  by the American Academy of Family Physicians.       \\\"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of  care they are able to provide to their patients,\\\" said HRSA Administrator  Robert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  \\\"This project will be a great resource for  health care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve.\\\"       \\\"This service has opened a new means of communication between health care  professionals and experts on HIV care management,\\\" said HRSA's associate  administrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources  Development, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  \\\"Providers who treat people with  HIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment  methods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS.\\\"       HRSA is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within HHS.

Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere  that they are on the surface of. Similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the surface of.  These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design meet these problems neatly.  When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear the algorithm should afil or return infinite R. When intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities they are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle) they are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius.  This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced  it can also be achieved by  If all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle.   It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar. The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar.

It is DOS!  If you leave a file open on a floppy drive, then change the disk and do something which updates or closes that file, you have a good chance of getting part of the directory and FAT from the other disk written to the new disk.

Being brought up in a Christian household, I often wondered if there was God the Father, where was the mother? Everyone I know who has a father usually as a mother. It just seemed rather unbalanced to me.   Fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not fall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both a masculine and feminine force. It provides a sense of balance I find sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which I think is responsible for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat each other.\",\" There are a couple.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design     team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.       ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into     Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20     Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas     scintillation proportional counters.       CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint     NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian     system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.     After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA     trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon     arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens     Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours     while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter     continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and     targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the     mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,     rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's     satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.      One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.      The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the     first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of     Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan     Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true     nature of Saturn's rings.    Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)   -------------------------------------------------------------     10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch     04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist     06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist     08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist     12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist     06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival     01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release     01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry     06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission      (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)       GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit. Has returned     the first resolved images of an asteroid, Gaspra, while in transit to     Jupiter. Efforts to unfurl the stuck High-Gain Antenna (HGA) have     essentially been abandoned. JPL has developed a backup plan using data     compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from     the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve     approximately 70% of its original objectives.

Has made     multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite,     into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon.       MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire     surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity     map.       MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.     Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in     transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for     one martian year (687 days).       TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched     8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the     TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global     observations of the sea level for several years, substantially     increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also     will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.       ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over     its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields     experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for     various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.      Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of     the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from     that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist     manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole     in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its     perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft     that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!      While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and     radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see     *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical     detail, see the many articles in the same issue.       OTHER SPACE SCIENCE MISSIONS (note: this is based on a posting by Ron     Baalke in 11/89, with ISAS/NASDA information contributed by Yoshiro     Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp). I'm attempting to track changes based     on updated shuttle manifests; corrections and updates are welcome.      1993 Missions  o ALEXIS [spring, Pegasus]      ALEXIS (Array of Low-Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors) is to perform      a wide-field sky survey in the \\\"soft\\\" (low-energy) X-ray      spectrum. It will scan the entire sky every six months to search      for variations in soft-X-ray emission from sources such as white      dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars and flare stars. It will also      search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron      stars and gamma-ray bursters. ALEXIS is a project of Los Alamos      National Laboratory and is primarily a technology development      mission that uses astrophysical sources to demonstrate the      technology.

No tickets, no accidents, own a house, have taken defensive driving 1, airbag, abs, security alarm, single.   $1500/year  $500 decut. State Farm Insurance (this includes the additional $100 for the $1,000,000 umbrella policy over my car and house)  The base policy is the standard $100,000 - $100,000 - $300,000 policy required in DE.   After 2nd defensive driving course it will be 5% less.   I bought the car in September 1992.  The company I was with (never had and accident or ticket in 11 years) quoted me $2,500.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years). I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling (and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury car.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924. I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car.   \\\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as the Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue to handle your account.   \\\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard [higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with a 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year, but cancel you after that.\\\"   \\\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually faster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\\\"    That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers - as very traditional and conservative.\\\"   I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure guy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft.      /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.   / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil ========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======           ======================================================================== 32   I live in Idaho.

I'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx in advance)  I want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There \\\"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.\\\"          Thanx in advance... Shaz....  [I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions. The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style of the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significant differences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying text.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by hand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the original, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are generally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved, but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there's much uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error.  But I also don't think there's enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that it has much practical effect.  Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot topic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it (though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details that don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there being multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in all the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've been referring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get referenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been editions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into single narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor objects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible has long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making editions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from a variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine one of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all inaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any edition that's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is. (Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a few translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best, I'm afraid.)\",\"The Blackhawks shall triumph.\",\" ^^^^^^^^^^                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   !!!!!!^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    It is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to use the net to directly advertise their products.

Around a million Americans every year defend themselves with firearms.  In many of these cases the defender doesn't even have to fire a shot!  The mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the deterrent that is needed.  I don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  But, taking away the right of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent crime problem in this country.  If honest, law-abiding citizens are unable to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will be able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling guns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns should be banned by the Klintonistas.   Statistics, por favor?   See my previous post.  That ought to set you straight.   People have the right to keep and bear arms no matter what the Constitution says.

I wanted to send him a comment on something in his terraforming book.   Paul F. Dietz  dietz@cs.rochester.edu\",\"    Now this is getting interesting!  I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some reason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean the raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:  1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was  pretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right now.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the \\\"great judgement\\\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day). I was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my \\\"soul\\\" (which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?  2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms  that my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My physical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be tortured for all eternity?  3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical place to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth? Do you think we could find it if we dig?  Mark Schnitzius schnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu Univ. of Central Florida  [There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur until a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the meantime, some believe that people \\\"sleep\\\" until the final resurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe that souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then. There are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.  The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a different \\\"technology\\\" than the current one, one which is not mortal. (Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus' resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not subject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other, but I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don't think I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be some analog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky.  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension, outside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have little in the way of details.\",\"/(emery) /The one single historic event that has had the biggest impact on the /world over the centuries is the resurrection of Jesus.    This is hardly possible, as the majority of people in the world were born, lived their life, and died, without ever knowing anything about Christ.  The majority of the rest of the world have decided that he  is not who Emery thinks he is.    /(emery) /Why were the writers of the New Testament documents so convinced that /Jesus really did rise from the dead? /We have four gospel accounts.

Circular reasoning, etc.  There have been occasions already stated many times for later generations of Xtians to change, edit, or otherwise alter the bible to fit their political gospel. And if we accept the bible as true just because the bible says it is true, then (to be fair) we have to do the same to the Bhagavad-Gita and the Koran, both of which contradict the bible.  Enough said.    /(emery) /Yet we have no reason to believe these disciples to be immoral and dishonest. /We have no historic information that would lead us to the conclusion that /these people were not God-fearing people who sincerely and whole-heartedly /believed that the resurrection of their Lord Jesus was a real event. /And for what gain would they lie?  To make a stand at that time meant  /persecution, imprisonment, and perhaps even death.  Again, this is only the biblical account and there is no independent proof of any of this happening.  It just isn't there.  Besides, simply being sincere or willing to die for your faith does not make your faith correct.  There are Muslims dying in Bosnia right now; does the fact that they are willing to die for Islam mean that Islam is the correct religion?

Roman historian, Cornelius  /Tacitus, Govenor of Asia, in A.D. 112, writing of Nero's reign, alluded to  /the torture of Christians in Rome:   All you have proven is that these people were tortured for their faith.  That does not prove that their faith is true or correct; it just means that they were sincere in their beliefs.   Being willing to die for what you believe doesn't make your belief the truth. It's not that easy.  And minority religions have always suffered torture; Muslims suffer torture and harassment in India and Bosnia today.  All religions are harassed in China today.  You haven't proven anything so far.    /(emery) /With all the suffering and persecution that it meant to be a believer, it /would be quite probable that at least one of those in the supposed conspiracy /would come forward and confess that the whole thing was a big hoax.

Thus, Hasan is wrong.   The word \\\"troops\\\" is unjustified.  There has never been any evidence that there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the village apart from the villagers defending themselves.  According to the Haganah observer Pa'il, the Irgun/Lehi forces suffered a lot of casualties because they were incompetent soldiers.  When they ran into trouble securing the central part of the village, a small group  of Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty. Begin's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of the major inaccuracies (to use a kind word) in his account.  Incidentally, \\\"three times as heavy\\\" may be correct, as there is serious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives than to the oft-quoted 250 lives.  However, note that Begin compares wounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number of wounded Arabs.  Guess why.   As is thoroughly established by many sources, the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a usueful warning.   It is worth noting how Begin disputes the standard myth that the Palestinian Arabs fled as part of a calculated plan.   Apparently 90% of Israeli historians are Jew-haters.

I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme is to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange, either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme like Diffie-Hellman.  If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone company or some other online central authority generates a session key and sends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of having some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for a copy of the session key for each call.      Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of every public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably, there will be some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally- signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit, stored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to everyone's public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to the security of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you don't use your designated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips.      It might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you to use either the original public/private key pair, or some other key pair and verification scheme.

How do I make a screendump or print my application?   The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window  or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window.  The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr  client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:   csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd & and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current display will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an undocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the  command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for  specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]   Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of  arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc. There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92] is the most recent.  xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders  XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr; see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.  A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information:  soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.  xprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.   To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr, which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps and XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for  use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive servers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.   The XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and save it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.   Also:    Bristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter  2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net in vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.   ColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen- capture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and  non-PostScript printers.   Some vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows)  include session managers or other desktop programs which include \\\"print portion of screen\\\" or \\\"take a snapshot\\\" options. Some platforms also have tools which  can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example,  have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals  have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.   Some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct  support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package  to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?   If you need color PostScript in particular, you can   - grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color  PostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv   - grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS. You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick  distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?   This can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider  instead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?   The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++  Portable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting  among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps,  gray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently; the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.  Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in  particular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary. It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).   Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are  later versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.   Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export;  see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.   xv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley),  can read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF,  GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity,  contrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned  formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on  it, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92;  see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.   The Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>. Conversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available via FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z,  and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.   The Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads and writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.   The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar  to PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*,  weedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.   Xim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential  interactive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is  a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and  Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif,  xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a library and command-line utilities for building your own applications.   ImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from  export's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display images on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF from other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.   xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining simple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90] xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.   A version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool is available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package  also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget.

The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the string which appears in the window titlebar.  A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell:   echo \\\"ESC]2;TEXT^G\\\" where ESC is the escape key, TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed, and ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character).   Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change directories:   alias newcd 'cd \\\\!*; echo -n ESC]2\\\\;$cwd^G'   The digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should  change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name  used in the icon, use the digit '0' instead, and use '1' to change only the  icon name.   Note: another way to do this, which prevents an incorrect display of the local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell, is to wrap the escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself.   Note: on an IBM RS/6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with a ^V.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  29)  Where can I find the xterm control sequences?  The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file  ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z.  O'Reilly's Volume 3, the X User's Guide, includes an R5 version of the control  sequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93, and a Motif version of  the book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version of the control sequences. [1/93]  Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document and also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a  compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100  sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was  published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).  In a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.

In order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to  \\\"stty pass8\\\" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as   XTerm*font:  -*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1  XTerm*boldfont: -*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 [The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]  In addition, you may want to set this in your shell:  setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1          For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with  the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using `man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (')  is Alt-'.

You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give  a resource specification like this:   xterm*geometry: 80x24 then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to 80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size.  But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:   xterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?   You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command.  However, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for  manipulating the selection will help; e.g.   % xselection PRIMARY | lpr finds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a  window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties. A version is on export.  Also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be adapted to do this.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?   You can use several environment variables to control how resources are  loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and  XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for  application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.   Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a  way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies. Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also  have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could  set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up  app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located):  setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N  The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see  XtResolvePathname()):          %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the                 application's class name.         %T      The value of the file \\\"type\\\".  In this case, the                 literal string \\\"app-defaults\\\"         %C      customization resource (R5 only)         %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.         %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \\\"ja_JP.EUC\\\")         %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \\\"ja\\\")         %t      The territory part of the display's language string         %c      The codeset part of the display's language string   Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is  \\\"Myterm\\\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the  example omits locale-specific lookup.)  /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm  $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm   As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above  app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it  and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to  search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.   Let's consider another example. This time, let's set  XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working  directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.  setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N   The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands  to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging  because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file  Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and %S are useless.   With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization  resource value.  For example, you might run the \\\"myterm\\\" application like this:  myterm -xrm \\\"*customization: -color\\\"   If one of your pathname specifications had the value \\\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\\\" then the expanded pathname would be \\\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\\\" because the %C substitution character  takes on the value of the customization resource.   The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:   /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N   (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.)   The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is    <root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   <root>/%L/%N:\\\\   <root>/%l/%N:\\\\   <root>/%N:   <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory  if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other  than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.   Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find  your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR  to \\\".\\\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3  compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \\\"./\\\", a dot followed  by a slash.

The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources; for example,  your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line   DisplayManager.0.authorize: false  to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also   DisplayManager*xrdb: /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:  #!/bin/sh  #comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources  /usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap  /usr/bin/X11/xrdb $* Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.  Note that this is a  general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client.  [Thanks to Jay Bourland (jayb@cauchy.stanford.edu), 9/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  36)  Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my .xsession file?   When xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login files. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script; or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and source it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or, if you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your  .xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting your .xsession file off with \\\"#!/bin/csh\\\".   If this doesn't work, also try starting off with:   #!/bin/sh   # Reset path:   PATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?   There are several ways to avoid having to do a \\\"setenv DISPLAY ...\\\" whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.  One solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It  includes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and xrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine. A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.  One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from 132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and $DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then  propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain   eval `xrlogind` where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special  format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to  recreate the environment variables. [11/90]   In addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on  another host, and you find   rsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY  too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh  can be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be    xrsh <HOST> xterm    #! /bin/sh   # start an X11 process on another host   # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT   # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu>   # rsh $host -n \\\"setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null\\\"   #   # An improved version:   # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson, jr@bbn.com)   #       (generalized for sh,ksh by Keith Boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu)   #   # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.

One way is to use the \\\"bitmap\\\" client or some other bitmap-editor (e.g. Sun's icon-editor tool, post-processed with pbmplus) to design the individual  characters and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate  them into the BDF format. See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X  Journal for more information.  The R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained  a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.  An easier way is to use the \\\"xfed\\\" client to modify an existing font; a version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is  available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63],  possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce BDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.  The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors, XPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in /pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed  [5/91] in export:/contrib.   If you are a MetaFont user you can use \\\"mftobdf\\\" from the SeeTeX distribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe, a font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.  The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these tools to modify a font.  Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?   After you have built the font using your system's font-compiler,  installed it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent (e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp  $dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the  directory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably  leaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in  the path.)  Sometimes your \\\"xset +fp $dir\\\" command fails with a BadValue error:   X Error of failed request:BadValue    (integer parameter out of range for operation)   Major opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)   This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The mention of an \\\"integer parameter\\\" in the message is spurious.)  -- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file    system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your    font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an    xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \\\"xset +fp ~/myfonts\\\") and    the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.  -- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server    (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file    \\\"fonts.dir\\\".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're    running OpenWindows, look for the file \\\"Families.list\\\".  If you can't find    it, run bldfamily(1).)  -- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a    proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for    example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.    Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for    Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work    for X11Rn.

A tool called \\\"snftobdf 1.4\\\" is part of the bdftools package, which is  available from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from  crl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?   der Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and  produces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be  used as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can  understand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools  such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail  from mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]  In addition, the R5 program \\\"fstobdf\\\" can produce bdf for any font that the R5 server has access to.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?   The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation, but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file  contrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is  for a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for  creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers  which do not use the MIT font scheme.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  43)  How do I add \\\".bdf\\\" fonts to my DECwindows server?   The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the \\\".pcf\\\" format. You can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc font-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a performance hit.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?) I want to be able to do something like this:  xclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave   You can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the  same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because  of this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since  there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore,  neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap  converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a  resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for  use in many of its widgets, however. [courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]  However:  A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of  the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick  (basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of  image formats as a pixmap.   The leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used  by Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by AT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM  distribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write  routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information on the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on  the R5 contrib tape.

When I eat foods with MSG I get very thirsty and my hands swell and get a terrible itchy rash. I first experienced this problem when I worked close to Chinatown and ate Chinese food almost everyday for lunch.  Now I can't tolerate MSG at all.  I can notice immediately when I have eaten any.  I try to avoid MSG completely.  Interesting fact though is that all three of my children started experiencing the exact same rash on their hands.  I couldn't understand why because I don't MSG in cooking and we ask for no MSG when we do eat Chinese (I still love it).  After some investigation I knew that Oodles of Noodles where one of their favorite foods.  One of the main ingredients in the flavor packets is MSG.  Now I look at all labels.  You would be surprised at places you find MSG. \",\"    I disagree.  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real- istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they still go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is  bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are trying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect  examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals that would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to attract, that these players are indeed superstars.    It ain't nearly so simple as this.  The casual fan doesn't think about much  at all.  Can you actually find an adult with a 3 digit IQ who believes that McDonalds makes good hamburgers?    Yes but apparently the Rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi- bilities has he?  He was hyped, initially, as a superstar, but outside of one Grey Cup game he has done very little to maintain/enhance that assess- ment of his talents.  Most Argo fans probably feel the team would be better off without him.   cordially, as always,  rm \",\"I responded to a post last week and it carried somewhat of a hostile tone for which I am apologizing for.

E.G. homoeopathy: like cures like.  The more you dilute things, the more powerful they get, even if you dilute them so much there is no ingredient but water left.  Chiropractic: all illness stems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae.  Such systems are so patently absurd, that any good they do is accidental and not related to the theory.  The only exception is probably herbalism, because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants and are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants that have active and useful substances.  But that isn't what  is meant by alternative medicine, usually.

And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the inevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are doing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is possible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the eyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing people for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and Annias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His plan might be accomplished.     But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to execute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to fulfill the chorus of \\\"Let his blood be upon our hands\\\" of the crowd in Jersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel, which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish other nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament.  Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, \\\"Mene, mene, tekel, peres?\\\"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's justice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians as their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the extirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel.  The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and the Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go on with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is quite clear. Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to question why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom, He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans 9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of Jesus Christ is as follows: \\\"Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.\\\"  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - \\\"Let the dead bury the dead, come, follow me.\\\"  There is not an infinite amount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to follow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, \\\"well, alright, you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your plans.\\\"  He said \\\"Follow me.\\\"  His message is NOT \\\"I'm just a sweety-pie who would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and Divine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale.\\\"  \\\"Our great God and Savior\\\" Jesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the world.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.\",\"Roland HS-60 (SynthPlus 60)   - 6 voice polyphonic fully programmable analog synthesizer   - 61 full size keys   - MIDI   - Memory to store 128 patches   - built in speakers   - Connectors: MIDI in thru out, Input(2), Expansion Pedal, Head Phones,     Tape Load & Save, Patch Shift, Pedal Hold, Output(2)  Asking $225\",\"Forsale:  Proton P1100 preamplifier ========================= About 3.5 years old, originally $299, asking $150 or best offer.

To one brought up, as most Americans have   been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of   the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious  differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they  were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every   nation in the world would have treated as treasonable.

Shaw  (History),  who  recently completed  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the Turkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in Rescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution, 1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree program in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for the Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the G. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.  Editor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and European and Turkish Jews?  Shaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish. I've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as time went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews, I collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a couple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the 500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and coming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire Avenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman Jewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became motivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The Jews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book is quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who tend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint of the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish sources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I approach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of view of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I finished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across additional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War II. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good deal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not actually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in the Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish diplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It was too late to add this new information to the book in press, so I decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research, mainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the Turkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second book, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped rescue Jews from the Nazis.  - How exactly did they do this?  The story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents the material in three parts, first of which deals with the period before the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in 1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi Germans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and the like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of reforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were being fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new talent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three months  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey arranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and were   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish universities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical personnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors came to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political scientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in Turkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the Berlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist, came to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics in Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the Nazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually came to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other German Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey. One  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical producer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to Turkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the Turkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul Hindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first phase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by Turkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in Turkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded themselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in the anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I even  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey praising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting the idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been persecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the Nazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The second part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in 1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and especially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They had migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of the century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the Turkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was threatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews throughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might happen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled to France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their Turkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the Nazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of anti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not worth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot to be a Turkish Jew.  - How so?  Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained its embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries until it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the end of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position to  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the actions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of the  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in particular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from the Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish citizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were arrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats would  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other officials and say in effect:  \\\"These people are Turkish citizens. You  can't do  this  to  them.\\\" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be released.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.  The Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey. They hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion of the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and manganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they usually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews. The Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps to secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded trains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and succeeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews were sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in Paris,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish consuls took place.  The greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned their  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The consuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens because  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews lining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get passports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their Turkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so processing the application would take  some time. In the meantime it was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on the streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them if they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because radios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of these  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a document called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  \\\"irregular fellow citizen.\\\" The  document said in  effect \\\"This person is  a former Turkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his Turkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if you  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.\\\"  The diplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on it. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they accepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this means, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who had relinquished their Turkish citizenship.  Actually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of Jews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to retain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these interventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all Jews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to prevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz before the Turkish consuls could do anything.  - Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?  There were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War II,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the information in this section of  the book relates to the situation in France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls sent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in reply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would present  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are Turkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the Nazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish consuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from Nazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran regularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas so they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were often  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern Europe  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these governments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result of the Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish Jews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to Auschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either escaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of southern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much better than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy fell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well. Incidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also worked to rescue Jews in that country.  - The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats acting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin from Nazi persecution.  Yes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their interventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their treaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German territory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey. On  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not discriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis claimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not discriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally. Turkey  protested,   saying,  \\\"You  are  dividing   our  citizens according to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that all  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion. Therefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews.\\\" American consuls in  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told American Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they couldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were being treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book takes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the Holocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European Jews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in Palestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in Istanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other Jewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also sent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These groups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out what was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at that  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn't imagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the first step was to get information, and the Turkish government let them use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and friends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out what was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the Nazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received assistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who served as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to 1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican representative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the Catholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was doing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern Europe.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these agencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even railroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much in Poland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the Polish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for the Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the so called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through the Black Sea to Istanbul.  Turkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its borders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was suffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The government,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the non-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by the Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and Palestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean from southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly opposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did not want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they feared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British constantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic and send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government, yielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For example, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700 Jewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish government  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British ambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all were lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish government allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to pass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during the Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these refugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to send money and food out of the country.  - Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be living in Israel.  Yes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to the first group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not go  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the non-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en route to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.  - And you have rescued it from obscurity.  Many studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do not focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of the scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of whom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a much smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the picture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to undertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.  When it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively small in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The rescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so significant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were murdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.  About  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  - translations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the story is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware of  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the people of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would not  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they could see the documents.  - What languages are used in the documents?  Most of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There is a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of the boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I did not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what Turkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A few documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did not necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in fact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying to  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For example, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency was  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in helping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President Roosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had been an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York City, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The documents related to his mission are in English.  I also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust historian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His father was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had gathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn't personally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more can  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone someday will make the effort.  - This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?  Right. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the Ottoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In addition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been actively involved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the coming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I helped organize  a large international conference  on the subject which was held in Istanbul in 1992.  - Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken place, what do you plan to do next?  I'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War for Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the years  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the victorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its independence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid II, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an important modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed all sorts of political movements.  Stanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in British History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning a second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate at Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School of  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the University of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the University of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to UCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute in  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National Endowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He has  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and Bosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor for lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish studies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and Culture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in Washington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional service activities and public lectures  in both the United States and Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited volume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2 vols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or reprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983, 1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York University Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation by the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the Holocaust: Turkey's  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry from Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan Publishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.  A pamphlet summarizing the book was published in Ankara, Turkey, in 1992.  Serdar Argic\",\" Sorry, not so -- the changes in sunrise and sunset times are not quite synchronized.

The ethnic composition depends on what you mean by formed.  What the UN deeded to Israel?  What it won in war?     Were there anti-trust laws in place in mandatory Palestine? Since the answer is no, you're argument, while interestingly constructed, is irrelevant.  I will however, respond to a few points you assert in the course of talking about anti-trust laws.     And those fleeing Arab lands, where Jews were second class citizens.     Jews often paid far more than fair market value for the land they bought.    You know, Sam, when people start talking about an International Jewish conspiracy, its really begins to sound like anti-Semitic bull.   The reason there is no conspiracy here is quite simple. Zionists made no bones about what was going on.  There were conferences, publications, etc, all talking about creating a National home for the Jews.    [...]   Because you've never heard of it, its dead?  The fact is, you claimed Israel had to give arabs rights because of (non-existant) International aid.  Then you see that that argument has a hole you could drive a truck through, and again assert that Israel is only democratic within the (unexplained) constraints of one ethnic group. The problem with that argument is that Arabs are allowed to vote for whoever they please.  So, please tell me, Sam, what constraints are there on Israeli democracy that don't exist in other democratic states?   I've never heard anything about the Khazakistani arab population.  Does that mean that they have no history or roots?  When I was at Ben Gurion university in Israel, one of my neighbors was an Israeli arab.  He wasn't really all that different from my other neighbors.  Does that make him dead or oppressed?     How recent is recent?  I can probably build a case for a Jewish Gaza city.  It would be pretty silly, but I could do it.  I'm arguing not that Jerusalem is Jewish, but that land has no ethnicity.

TRANSLATION   The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self.                                    PURPORT   All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the beginning of transcendental life.   As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.  Bhagavad-Gita As It is Books of A.C.

Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in, load it up so heavily with attack dogs, barbed wire, and land mines that most people fleeing over it die, and then give everyone the choice of obedience, prison, or flight.  This would be a bad science-fiction novel, if the East Germans hadn't actually done it.  The last person to die crossing the wall, as I recall, was an unarmed woman who was shot in the back.

Assuming that they are using civilians for cover, are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country? If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working? Why is it  further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages? Why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone? You see, there is more to the shelling of the villages.... it is called RETALIATION... \\\"GETTING BACK\\\" ...\\\"GETTING EVEN\\\". It doesn't make sense to shell the villages. The least it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of civilians.

I think Basil is a very intelligent person and I respect what he writes. Basil is a person that I would gladly call a friend. He is, however, not me. Nor am I Lebanese, as some seem to suspect.    Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. Of course, if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't make the Lebanese so mad as to do that. Furthermore, with Hezbollah  subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.   Tim, when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border? Not lately, eh?  Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use territory under their control to attack Israel. While Lebanon would be better off with Syria and Israel out of its borders, the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory (not on Israeli troops in Lebanon, however. Please note the distinction) in the past two years.   I disagree, Basil has always seemed to me to be a cool-headed person, slow to anger (certainly more so than I). What is most important is that he is an  actual witness to things from the other end of the Israeli guns. If only the  Israeli government would remember what it was like when the roles were  reversed perhaps they would moderate their \\\"retaliation\\\".\",\"A delightful message, interesting, and so kindly written.
