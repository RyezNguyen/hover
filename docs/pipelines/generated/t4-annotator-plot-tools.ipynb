You are probably wondering why I must sell the case with the motherboard. It is simply because the case is custom-made for this particular board and   you would be hard-pressed to fit another MB in it.  However, the case and   this motherboard were made to go together and fit perfectly.  As you can see, since this board includes drive controllers AND a video    controller, you can save some money by buying this unit and not a MB   where you would need to get IO cards, video card, and drive controllers   Its just a lot more convenient on the whole  I would like to ask about $500 for this whole package.  I think this is a fair   price given the facts that it includes a video card and drive controllers/IO   ports.  All you need to do is add drives, a monitor, RAM, and a keyboard.    Also keep in mind that it isn't a generic board, but from CompuAdd. I also will entertain all serious offers.

Their documents have decayed to dust too.  Brian, why another excuse?    Peter wrote a bit of the Bible.  What Peter says about God is what the Bible says.      Consider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands of years, various people come up and testify of their experience with the living God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses, once the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes David, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King  Nebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes Nehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent takes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use to kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up comes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself. Up comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS agents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years with people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself \\\"I am.\\\"   While you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that King David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known Matthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these people are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet all of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells of his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is different, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly reveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God. What Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of Babylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different perspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony dares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness's testimony, even though different from those prior, consistently describes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.    Now.

Wirewrap gets into trouble at much higher frequencies than any TTL can handle.  The 'increase' of wiring capacitance is not really relevant (you have to use transmission line techniques, and the capacitance is no problem).     Hand-powered is a terrible choice (IMHO) unless you are a field maintenance person who will do maybe a dozen connections at a time.  Your hands will cramp.

Some new drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some* track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.  I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.  Hope this helps.\",\"Archive-name: rec-autos/part4  [this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions of general consumer interest, and is broken out to facilitate crossposting to misc.consumers -- rpw]  [last change: 8 February 1993; CT now permits radar detector usage,     new tire-traction q&a -- rpw]                  Commonly Asked Questions  Radar Questions:  Q:  Where are radar detectors illegal?  A:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit     all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in     large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,     Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They     are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.     Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other     jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.  Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?  A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,     but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe     to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.     They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently     available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate     more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.     New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected     by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a     detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned     on.  Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?  A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance     computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target     vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR     system.  Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be     able to handle it?   A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US     in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a     low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the     direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the     radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.     Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low     power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar     detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,     although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such     capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use     is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:     learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they     are used (or else, don't speed.)  Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?  A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.     Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.     Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the     military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the     Federal Communications Commission of the USA.  Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:  Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?  A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a     car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)     Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to     be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they     tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',     or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)     Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that     untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into     trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle     in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance     oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing     throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle     may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or     spinning.      Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car     will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the     angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling     and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to     travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle     than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater     slip angle than the front wheels.  Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?  A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear    than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally    you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop    rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle    before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to    the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.  Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?  A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while    braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot    for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you    use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to    match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;    often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side    on the throttle.     Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the    left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing    the same thing.  Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?  A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of    three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for    declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the    transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with    rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch    engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission    speed up.     The procedure is as follows:    (0) declutch    (1) move gearshift lever to neutral    (2) engage clutch    (3) match revs    (4) declutch    (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear    (6) engage clutch     This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.    The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the    synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or    with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.    Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at    all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good    condition.  Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and    slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?  A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and    2) almost never.     In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times    in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the    same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine    that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite    pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from    driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*    major) part of the equation.     Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really    only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically    when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the    comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.    This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads    are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply    of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.     Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the    automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced    by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the    car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making    a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end    of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car    has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'    setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of    caveats could go on for page after page.  Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according    to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate    or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?  A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.     2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics    textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,    none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a    stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating    temperature.     Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser    extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a    substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been    coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match    the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire    at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses    inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling    friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire    is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will    be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its    proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some    part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like    to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.    (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal    street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of    high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)     Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,    it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters    accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than    1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible    for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of    grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques    such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?

A:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and     Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,     which causes some confusion.

There is only one way of determin- ing \\\"best\\\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess  used to determine the \\\"best\\\" is the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.  To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.  If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the only measure of \\\"best\\\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base- ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham- pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub- jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.   Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens. I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.   You don't have to be rude.   For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per- formance.  The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new knowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less  incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.  -- \",\"       Carlos,     Why not check out some of the scientific research that has been done in this area and convince yourself.

This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride    (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty,     fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).  Communication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler back every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled Magna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you  can't really communicate.  Balance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how they're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately and lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning thing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a pain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay perpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn and WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always screws up the line I've picked out.  Here's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:  - attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.  - Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not    get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount    in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)  - Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)  - We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many    first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)  - Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and    we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're    confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel    of it.  Or just hug me tight.    - Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be     gradual, so I can compensate.  - Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.  - Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right     thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how    to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to    stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to     watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84,     and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, \\\"SLOW DOWN!

I proposed this theory *months* ago.  Let's take it one step further, even.  If, as the surveys show, up to 33% of all men have *had* a homosexual encounter, then there must be an even *larger* percentage of people who have had homosexual erotic fantasies.  But if less than 10% of the population is gay, what can we say about these people who don't identify as gay but have demonstrated gay potential.  Obviously, a large chunk of these people *chose* (or, more accurately, were forced to choose by force of religion and social sanction) to put those feelings aside, to be heterosexual.     Obviously, Cramer and Kaldis fall into this category.     These people are the ones who are so hung up on \\\"choice.\\\" Obviously, since *they chose*, everyone must have, and homosexuals are just flaunting their \\\"perversion\\\" by choosing not to go along with what society has dictated.

In 1943, this battalion  had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of Dro  (the butcher) who is the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5  million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council  was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was  recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily  formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the  principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the  Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination  of the Jews.  This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \\\"encore\\\" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.

I do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards.  He does not have too much offensive capabilities, but he is an awesome defensively. Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:) I forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.   As far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who beat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.   I agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that Lankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make a perfect throw?   I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don't forget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/ Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant race when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I will never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading in the right direction.   One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds, but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the East), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they lose.

I just read my first newspaper in a while and noticed an article on a 'messianic cult' leader named 'David Koresh'.  I'd like to know more about this and what is going on with them.  Please email me as I don't normally read this newsgroup.  Thanks. \",\" I attribute my success to several factors:  Very low fat.  Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me, I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.  Very little sugar or salt.  Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)  My \\\"clean your plate\\\" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last 10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch up, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.  I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry shortly, and eating won't be practical then).  I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to stores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car. I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes runs in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle.)  There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately, it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.  Obviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've done will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who did try it and didn't succeed.   I'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat. I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty, my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes off again over a week or two. --  Keith Lynch, kfl@access.digex.com\",\"I need to port several OS/2 PM applications to X (OpenWindows or Motif), and desperately need any information on how to go about doing this (short of a complete rewrite.

So hard atheism has nothing to prove?  Then how does it justify that God does not exist?  I know, there's the FAQ, etc.  But guess what -- if those justifications were so compelling why aren't people flocking to _hard_ atheism?  They're not, and they won't.  I for one will discourage people from hard atheism by pointing out those very sources as reliable statements on hard atheism.  Second, what makes you think I'm defending any given religion?  I'm merely recognizing hard atheism for what it is, a faith.  And yes, by \\\"we\\\" I am referring to every reader of the post.

At least I will apologize by qualifying my original statement with \\\"hard atheist\\\" in place of atheist.  Would you call John the Baptist arrogant, who boasted of one greater than he?  That's what many Christians do today.  How is that _in itself_ arrogant?

So, she's married to Joseph.  She gets knocked up.  What do you think ol' Joe will do if he finds she's been getting around?  So Mary comes up with this ridiculous story about God making her pregnant.  Actually, it can't be all THAT ridiculous, considering the number of people that believe it.  Anyway, she never tells anyone the truth, and even tells poor little Jesus that he's hot shit, the Son of God.  Everyone else tells him this too, since they've bought Mary's story.  So, what does Mary actually turn out to be?  An adultress and a liar, and the cause of mankind's greatest folly...  Just my recently-minted two cents.

Pre-game comments ----------------- Don's pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... The goalie who gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series for his team.  Eposode Summary --------------- This episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that he bought from the concession stand.  Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the Toronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow and proclaimed \\\"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks of me. Beauty.\\\"  Next, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to him, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all the arenas in the NHL.  From there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game had great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game in the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All stop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary by Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most penalties gets to ref in the finals.  Next, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for the Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the wins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup and the AHL championships.  Finally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the Rangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved. Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had several key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who went cold.  Don had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party's over, Adolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer be a 'country club'.... \\\"NY should be achamed of themselves... If they go in the tank with Adolf there, they'll be hanging from the yardarm by their thumbs.\\\"   Rating ------ Nothing too special in this episode.

An On/Off Road Rally consists of the following:     1. An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of       directions and clues guiding participates around the        Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course       based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will       be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which       they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the       number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately        lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is        set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points       will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions       or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,       basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.     2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants       will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.       Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles       without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half       the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle       unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will       divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified       4x4s can run the course.         At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring   participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.   Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.  * This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles   so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be   street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section   of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper   from their vehicle :) .

The trap is the easy way out.  For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race, and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors leading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than not, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.  If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few Blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable or whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to define \\\"us\\\" and \\\"other\\\" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational humans.  It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the *most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial makeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in San Francisco, a city that loves to tout its \\\"ethnic diversity\\\". Here, we have Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the \\\"model minority\\\") gangs, and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and crime are what they most fear. During the \\\"disturbance\\\" in Los Angeles last year many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I remember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned from TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives that live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly multi-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black* riot!  In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points that really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem becomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly believe that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current course of denial and repression.  I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors, luck in avoiding the \\\"trap\\\".

Try putting the set on a Variac or adjustable transformer and lower the AC input voltage to the set to about 90 volts.  If the set operates nromally, then you know you've got a shorted regulator.

It :    is also where the high bandwidth comes from, and the fantastic :    image, and the large image size, etc, etc... :  : It's also where the two annoying lines across the screen (one a third : down, the other two thirds down) come from. :   The 2 lines are not a result of the high end trinitron tube, these 2 wires will be found on all 17\\\" trinitron tubes (e.g., Mitsubishi 17\\\", Sony 1604, etc).  On 14\\\" Sony tubes, you'll find one wire.  Their level of annoyance is purely subjective.  I'm so happy with the sharpness of the T560i that I don't even notice the lines.  The T560i uses a Trinitron SA tube which, when viewed as a complete tube, has a larger diameter than the standard Trinitron tube.  This results in  a flatter screen than other 17\\\" monitors using the standard trinitron  (which has a vertically flat but not horizontally flat surface), and  apparently the ability to provide a tighter beam focus.   \",\"First of all let's assume that you are right that fewer guns would make it  in to the country, that sounds great (to those that see guns as inherently evil) except then every one  of those guns would be in the hands  of someone who obviously couldn't care less about following the law, after all they  got the gun illegally, so is more likely to commit a crime with that gun.

I would suggest that you take your code, and submit it to comp.sys.mac.binaries to be distributed (including to the ftp sites).  Many folks, myself included, would enjoy the extra code.   Just to clarify, the 3D routines that are mentioned in various places on the mac are in a libray, not the ROM of the mac.  A few years ago before I knew anything about implementing graphics, I came across a demo of the Apple GrafSys3D library and it actually did a lot.  However, it is quite limited in the sense that it's a low-level 3D library; your code still has to plot individual points, draw each line, etc ad nauseum.  It has nothing on GL, for example, where you can handle objects.  Other things to consider when talking about Apple's old 3D GrafSys library:  * Unsupported;  never was and no plans exist to do so in the future  * Undocumented; unless you call header files documentation...  If one knows something about graphics, you could probably figure it out, but I'd assume there's better software available that gives better output and is, at the same time, programmatically nicer (i.e. easier to program).  Just my 2% tax\",\"Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card  Several problems:  1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB    of VRAM, which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED    with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K    colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB    VRAM.  2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:     a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an       Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often       remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to       be.     b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the       display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you       shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).  3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development    Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger    icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the    debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed    to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The    Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.     Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen    is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter    \\\"R\\\". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it    does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this.     The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive    behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with    Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles    the VGA mode.        The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use    another monitor in place of my usual one.  I still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty). \",\"Clinton has backed off from the $16 billion jobs bill.

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to have a \\\"dirty\\\" amp.     Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs  Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.     for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt    radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet     away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.    If you experience the problem frequently, it may be     caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station    nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio     transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,    etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are    correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.     If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite    chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably    being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can    be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).    Good instructions are included with the chokes.    If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your    neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof    or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things    a radio operator can do to reduce interference.  And please remember to be friendly when approaching your local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the  cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b. interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.    BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it. Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers to take any precautions.  Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more than 10).  So if you hear \\\"This is WA1QT\\\" or some other call starting with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham. CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required to) and fire/police have other private ids.      \",\"It is not true that dermatologists gave not reached the laser age, in fact, lasers in dermatological surgery is a very new and exciting field.

Nazi Armenians were of service  to Germans in Arab countries as well. As Uzun put it, one well-known  case which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian  agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes. The mission  of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and  to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied  forces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda  efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among  the French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was the center of international Armenian terrorism.   In Russia General Dro (the Butcher), the architect of the Turkish genocide in WWI, was working closely with the German Secret  Service.

The 27th was a short day at work, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24 Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the  car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit, and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and  her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to  45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?  When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was,  but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the  Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle around it. I ask, \\\"What's going on?\\\" Someone tells me, \\\"Come listen.\\\" Well they were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \\\"Brother Muslims, our time has come . . . \\\" and something else along that line. I didn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to  get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter.  New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And the comments started: \\\"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"There's no need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\\\" I even heard that: \\\"All  Moscow is behind us.\\\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this  was no joke. I quietly left and went home.  Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh,  that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of  things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.  My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku.  I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and  shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly, like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a  demonstration and move slowly.  My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd people are shouting \\\"Down with the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"Death to the Armenians!\\\" I waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street  on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned  and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26  Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there  was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same  kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside  from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.  My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of uneasy and said, \\\"No, let's stay at home instead.\\\" An hour went by, or maybe  an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.  I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside, and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time  there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more  aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration. They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run  again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I  followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was  leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one  side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square  and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There  was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals. I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \\\"We don't need  perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\\\" Now what did they  mean by \\\"living like we have been?\\\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else.  But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense  of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just  in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it  anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.  Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians'  apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't  hear them say \\\"kill them\\\" over the microphone, I only heard \\\"beat them and  drive them out.\\\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and  I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB. There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try  to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.  Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no demonstration, and I had to protect my family.  I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next to the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai- lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some- thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City  Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I  saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the  cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15  to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried  off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe  about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha.  When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was  about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He  has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I  have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of  people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled  around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.  Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting.  I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am,  I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags.  And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the  street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag,  which had \\\"Ermeni oryum\\\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \\\"Death to  Armenians!\\\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really know what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is Rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark blue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His  family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on  Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars;  their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the  left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a  new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son  was carrying a flag that said \\\"Death to Armenians!\\\" I was surprised because  before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being  done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.  Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \\\"It's OK, it'll pass,  they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up.\\\" Naturally I didn't  want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And  this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't  see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't  handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking  and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and  hashish to put in a store window!  So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one  would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again,  the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't  breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time.  True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much- vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people  died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I  couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be  specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of  Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.  When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \\\"Let's go upstairs.\\\"  We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the  evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more. I stopped at \\\"The Corner,\\\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I  look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to  the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old.  The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed  toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person,  wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as  though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more  noise, and the glass was flying again.  We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor, there was really no way to defend yourself there.  In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town.  On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or  what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him.

Does anyone have any useful advice they could offer to a first- time buyer? I'm not looking for anything sporty, just something functional  and reliable (less maintenance costs). Anybody have any ideas on what models  might suit me?  Thanks\",\" Having thought about this, why don't you project the 2 lines onto the 2d plane formed by the lines.  Do an intersection calculation in the plane in 2D, where you're guaranteed a unique solution (unless they're parallel which won't happen in this case), and then use parametric distance along the lines from the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest.  This bypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in 3d.  Hope I haven't put my foot in it again!  steve ---\",\"Finally got my computer fixed and I'd like to sum up.  About hard drive companies: the original 160 meg drive that was bad (bad sector or something) was an IBM.  The new one is a Quantum.  Is the LCIII supposed to be shipped with IBMs?  Is there a quality difference?  Apparently! :)  Second, about hard drive position.  I've put the LCIII on its side and the new 160 HD has had no problems at all.  I've even switched back and forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems.  As far as I'm concerned I don't believe HD position is important for drives up to 160 meg, in any computer.  Don't know about CD-ROM, though.    \\\"Just like everything else in life, the right lane ends in half a mile.\\\"\",\"What an exciting thread (finally!)  Mitra is Sanskrit for Friend, as such He started out as an avatar of Lord Visnu  mentioned first in the Vedas. Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence  worshipped by the Persians. Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun, he is  the lord of contract honor and obedience, therefore naturally worshipped by  soldiers. He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct-  antly agreed because of His obligation...the blood of that bull spilled and  grew all earth life...then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat.  Worship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians.  Hundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman  Pantheon (tm) for some semi-tricky reason, I forget why. But all references of  Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same, so apparently His worship  was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy, like membership  in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc. The sociology of religion in  ancient times is fascinating!  Oh, His B-day was 25 Dec. Ahem.  I am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the  Roman Imperial God Roster or what. It contained mostly soldiers, with 7 levels  of initiation. They worshipped underground in caverns in pews. The bull horns  in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits, I'm not sure  that they had Mithraic significance or not.  I don't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the  Christian masses. But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt.  Someone mentioned bullfighting. Did Mithraists sacrifice bulls? I forget. More  likely, for a religious source, might be the shower of bull's blood enjoyed  by the worshippers of Cybele on the Day of Blood? Cybele worship extended all  throughout even up to France bigtime.\",\"I saw his bike parked in front of a bar a few weeks later without the dog, and I wandered in to find out what had happened.

I'll continue to re-post periodically until *** he answers them, publicly indicates that he won't answer them, *** stops posting to alt.atheism, the alt.atheism community tells *** me to stop, or I get totally bored.  I apologize for the  *** somewhat juvenile nature of this approach, but I'm at a loss *** to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and  *** seeming intellectual dishonesty. *** *** This is re-post #3.   Charley,  I can't help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous posts.  I submit that you don't answer them because you cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once again challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for you as possible, I'll present concise re-statements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see.  Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I will re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at such time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this newsgroup.  I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be kind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it from this list.  Now, to the questions...  1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating that you weren't referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some atheists who you feel don't fit your patterns, to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your stereotype?  Here is the context for the question:    2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that \\\"senses and reason are all we have to go by\\\", and when pressed, you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...   then later...   then later...    3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by a.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify one such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical?  If so, please repeat them.  Here is the context for the question:    then later...    4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the \\\"axioms\\\" of reason that one couldn't help but become atheist.  I asked you to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that I have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer the question.  Please do so now.  Question: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that effect?  If you don't retract that claim, do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism?  Here is the context for the question:  [First quote] [Second quote]   5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these Challenges because they contained too much in the way of \\\"included text\\\" from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn't respond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify this seeming contradiction.  Question:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context from your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to avoid \\\"included text\\\"?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...    As usual, your responses are awaited with anticipation.  --Dave Wood   p.s., For the record, below is a compilation of Charley's responses to these challenges to date.  3/18/93  3/31/93 (#1)  3/31/93 (#2)\",\" Well Sweden and Australia, and lord knows wherever else used to drive on the \\\"wrong\\\" side of the road, so the export market might have been larger then than just the UK.   By the 1920s, there was a very active \\\"good roads\\\" movement, which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so, and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco \\\"America on the Road\\\" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called \\\"The Devil Wagon in God's Country\\\" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or John Bell Rae's auto histories.  As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I don't know why.

We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard Scanjet IIp was purchased this week.  Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:  John Sorenson Carol Sigelman Carla Moore Barbara Moose Judith Schrier  Again, thank you to all who gave!  I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to  review the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.   It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett  Packard Scanners.    When initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options;  (1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3)  automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image.   I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which  parts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.  Once an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The  software gives you two \\\"errors\\\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were  converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.   Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted  correctly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more  credit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue,  you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal  dictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited,  considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary.   After a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word  processor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a  seperate TIFF or PCX file format.  I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  an Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.   While most of my faxes were received in \\\"standard\\\" mode (200x100 dpi), the  accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent.   Overall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the  limitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just  too small.   If anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has  been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g.,  Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus,  Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences  of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera,  malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore,  control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug  resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease,  salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging  infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those  in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and  minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of  emerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more  effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs  (3).       This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \\\"Emerging Infectious  Diseases.\\\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as  surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and  public health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation  of an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4).   References  1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that  identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from  one restaurant chain. Washington       On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of  Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an  increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a  case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or  postdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls  implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset  (matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January  18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants  was initiated.       As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January- February 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the  state health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case  definition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS  (Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with  confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of  symptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A  restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients  who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating  a regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17  through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30  developed HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years  (range: 0-74 years). Idaho       Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health,  Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture- confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December  11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were  hospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13  (93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California       In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was  notified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died.  Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with  E. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993.  Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was  reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27%  increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January  1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as  postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured,  or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with  onset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993.       Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The  outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen  persons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median  age of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of  the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community  controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched  OR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients  who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular- sized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3).  Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada       On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten  at a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District  issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea  contact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody  diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness  with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with  onset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local  laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools  for E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After  SMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of  one patient 38 days after illness onset.       Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine  were hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range:  0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex- matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during  the week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence  limit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients  also implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7- 49.8). Other Investigation Findings       During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases  primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November  19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \\\"jumbo\\\" patties produced on  November 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11  lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed  to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672  (20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall.       A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the  United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing  the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter  plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one  slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.       Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in  families and child day care settings is ongoing.

Editorial Note: E. coli O157:H7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first  identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody  diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). This pathogen has since  emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common  cause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked  most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other  food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been  implicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter  study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7  that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10  participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a  higher rate than for any other pathogen.       Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most  clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  SMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses  associated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea  (often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups  and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and  complications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients  develop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,  renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%.       This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community  outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite  the magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in  three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington  (1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from  persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5).  When infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported  to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public  health action to prevent further cases.       E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can  contaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S.  Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify  critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce  the likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply.  Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with  pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens  from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be  internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook  ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices  are clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played  an important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim  recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to  155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993).       Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report  and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be  consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of  outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of  this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections  caused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E.  coli O157:H7.

Long-term use of  smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of  oral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who  currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1).  To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products,  CDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease  Prevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing  tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian,  noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This  report summarizes findings from this survey.       The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \\\"Have you used snuff at least 20  times in your entire life?\\\" and \\\"Do you use snuff now?\\\" Similar questions were  asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of  smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco  use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the  time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having  used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the  time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and  former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at  least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as  those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not  smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on  smokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or  equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide  national estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using  standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN)  (3).       In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users  of smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%)  women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco  use was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was  highest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was  highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan  Natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American  Indians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was  substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in  rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only  for women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1).       Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those  aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of  chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although  women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest  among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.       An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being  former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were  former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons  aged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users  (56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95%  CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users  was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5%  95% CI=68.9-78.1).       Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0)  currently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95%  CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95%  CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco.       Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3%  95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6- 49.6).   Reported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease  Prevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National  Center for Health Statistics, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless  tobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in  particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that  link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral  snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this  behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for  nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4).       Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among  racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels  and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require  further explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role  in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the  differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6).       In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current  smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the  prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco  users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous  study among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  occasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked  reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to  stop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health  implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use.       The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special  population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless  tobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year  2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more  than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the  prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless  tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts,  enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes  commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to  routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based  prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit  tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).

The above abstract lists various possible links to cannabis use (unfiltered almost guaranteed) and lung problems.  Someone may get overly excited when they see that article, but  without actually digging up the study and seeing how the studies gathered  their data it really doesn't tell you shit.  I'm going to track down that study hopefully tomarrow.  [...]   What justifies _the_ truth about drugs?  Research?  What sort of  research?  Correlational data can help establish a theory, but it does not prove anything.   Heroin _is_ a relatively safe drug.  What makes it unsafe are IV administration and shit like adulterants.  There are side effects, like withdrawal, but they effect people differently.     Stereotypical statement.  I know people who use heroin and opiates that  function just fine in society.     Name some of these drugs so we can debate about them more specifically.  [...]  NO, NO, NO.  (or at least I haven't been arguing this).  there is not enough data to form a scientific conclusion.  that _doesn't_ mean that cannabis is benign to users' lungs.  we can form all the theories we want, but they are only theories.  some theories are supported by more evidence than others, and that makes them stronger.     the hell I can't!  they state *UN-JUSTIFIED CONCLUSIONS* *AS FACT* as a *POLITICAL* strategy to stop drug use.

But the city's cable channel (35 in CableVision areas) shows this information map during travel times (6-9am and 4-7pm, I believe).  Most of the major LA freeways are covered.  The computer-generated map shows green, yellow, red, or flashing red (respectively: <40mph, 25-40mph, >25mph, and \\\"incident\\\"--I might be off a little on the speeds, since this is from memory).  I often look at this display in the morning to see if I really want to fight the traffic on the Sepulveda Pass or work from home for a little while to wait for it to clear.  Another poster explained the origin of the information: sensors (embedded wire loops) in the pavement near ramps and every half mile or so.  CalTrans has had a \\\"big board\\\" driven from this data in their traffic control center for some time.  I don't know if they are selling the data or if anyone with the equipment necessary for its transmission and display can have it.\",\" What it has to do with your original question is this: many times  beginning X users (heck, experienced X users too!) write small test programs.  Many times they forget to draw only in response to expose events, and thus see unpreditable results whereby sometimes the application's graphics show up, and sometimes they don't.  We're just trying to eliminate all the \\\"easy\\\" explanations  for why you're not seeing your graphics.   That being said, why don't you try copying different planes to your window other than 16 (== 1 << 4).  Try 1, 1<<1, 1<<2, ..., 1<<7 to see it you get any output.

My view is that you have to be in such a high degree of control that any alcohol could be potentially hazardous to my bike!  If I get hurt it's my own fault, but I don't want to wreck my Katana.  I developed this philosophy from an impromptu *experiment*.  I had one beer at 6:00 in the evening and had volleyball practice at 7:00.  I wasn't even close to leagle intoxication, but I couldn't perform even the most basic things until 8:30!  This made     me think about how I viewed alcohol and intoxication.

What happens is that the inside of my throat starts to feel \\\"puffy\\\", like I have a cold, and also at times the inside of my mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy.  The situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants (usually chinese), the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast food chain, a japanese steak house (I had the steak), and another chinese fast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.  I am under the impression that MSG \\\"enhances\\\" flavor by causing the taste buds to swell.  If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonable to assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.  Also, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above) involved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this is what I suspect as being the cause.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animals showed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a lab rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.  Anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are totally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied they know of.  I will probably respond to them however with a reminder of how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer (which the tobacco companies still deny).  - DM  (If I sound grumpy, it's because I had beef with broccoli for lunch today, and now it hurts to swallow)  -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Dan Myers (Madman)  | If the creator had intended us to walk  myers@usceast.cs.scarolina.edu | upright, he wouldn't have given us knuckles\",\"  This brings up an interesting subject that has not been discussed much, and probably has not been studied much.  As some of you may be aware, I've posted a lot of articles lately on personality typing (of which the MBTI is a test vehicle).  To come up to speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for by personality type summary file.  One observation is that people have significantly different personalities (no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect to church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while other people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more solitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if confronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of people.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.  My impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and create environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted (there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am quite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches to participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very uncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly influenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing. (BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both preferences have their place in the Body).  Maybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words are usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert scale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is excerpted from my summary:  1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:          Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside                           world of people, activities or things.          Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal                           world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.   Hopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can structure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise the Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities to fit them into a particular framework.  I'm sure there are other aspects of how churches have not properly understood personality variances among their members to the detriment of all.

A 2.7 per cent annual population growth rate implies a doubling in 69/2.7 \\\\approx 25 years. Can you imagine that? Most people seem not able to, and that is why so many deny that this problem exists, for me most especially in the industrialised countries (low growth rates, but large environmental impact). Iran's high growth rate threatens things like accelerated desertification due to intensive agriculture, deforestation, and water table drop. Similar to what is going on in California (this year's rain won't save you in Stanford!). This is probably more to blame than  the current government's incompetence for dropping living standards in Iran.\",\"Archive-name: hockey-faq  rec.sport.hockey answers to Frequently Asked Questions and other news:   Contents:  0.

It  is updated each month and only information currently under discussion or  of continuing importance or interest will be listed for more than two  postings.    Boston Bruins   Boston legislators and the developers proposing a new Boston Garden  finally agreed to a deal that puts the 19,000-seat, $160 million project  back on track to be finished in September 1995.   Right wing Daniel Marois will be sidelined indefinitely following  surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back. **   Sent defenseman Glen Murray to Providence of the American Hockey League.   Buffalo Sabres 1-800-333-PUCK (1-800-333-7825)   Acquired left winger Bob Errey from Pittsburgh for defenseman Mike  Ramsey. **   Veteran Buffalo Sabres broadcaster Ted Darling will be inducted into the  club's Hall of Fame Sunday, April 11.  Darling, who joined the expansion  Sabres in 1970, was the team's play-by-play announcer on both television  and radio until illness forced him out of the booth during last season. **   Recalled forwards Viktor Gordiouk and Doug MacDonald from Rochester of  American Hockey League.   Calgary Flames   Acquired veteran right wing Greg Paslawski from Philadelphia for future  considerations. **   Recalled center Todd Harkins and left winger Tomas Forslund from Salt  Lake City of International Hockey League.   Chicago Blackhawks         The $175 million, privately financed United Center, scheduled to  open in August 1994, will be home to the NBA's Chicago Bulls and NHL's  Chicago Blackhawks. The stadium is owned by entities controlled by the two  teams. The owners apparently still have not made a decision on whether the  old Chicago Stadium will be razed for parking space once the new facility,  located directly across the street, opens.   Suspended defenseman Craig Muni indefinitely for failing to report  following a trade with Edmonton.   Detroit Red Wings   Acquired defenseman Steve Konroyd from Hartford for a sixth-round draft  pick.   Annnounced the signing of right wing Joe Frederick, their 13th pick in  the 1989 National Hockey League entry draft. **   Two contrite hockey fans have returned the stolen Michigan Sports Hall  of Fame plaque honoring Detroit Red Wing great Gordie Howe. The bronze  plaque was stolen more than four years ago from Cobo Hall in Detroit, site  of the Michigan Hall of Fame.   Edmonton Oilers   Sent forward Esa Tikkanen to the New York Rangers for center Doug  Weight.   Traded defenseman Craig Muni to Chicago for forward Mike Hudson.   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Edmonton Oilers' lease with  Northlands Coliseum must be improved if the team is to survive in the  city. Edmonton Northlands is a non-profit agency set up by the city to  administer exhibition facilities including the Coliseum.  Oilers owner  Peter Pocklington calls his lease with Northlands horrendous and has  threatened to move the team if he doesn't get a better deal. He makes no  money from parking, concessions or building advertising. The 17,313-seat  Coliseum also has few of the lucrative private boxes that produce  significant revenues for other owners.   Announced center Kevin Todd will not need surgery but will miss the  remainder of the season with a separated shoulder.   Hartford Whalers   Sent defenseman Steve Konroyd to Detroit for a sixth-round draft pick.   Acquired left winger Robert Kron and a third-round draft pick from  Vancouver for left winger Murray Craven and a fifth-round draft pick. **   The state of Connecticut will begin negotiations to buy the Civic Center  from the city in an effort to keep the financially struggling Hartford  Whalers franchise in the city.   Los Angeles Kings   Sent center John McIntyre to the New York Rangers for defenseman Mark  Hardy and Ottawa's fifth-round 1993 draft pick.   Minnesota North Stars 1-800-800-0435 if calling from the U.S. 1-800-800-0458 if calling from Canada   The Dallas City Council has approved an agreement with the Minnesota  North Stars that will bring the NHL club to Reunion Arena next season.   Defenseman Mark Tinordi, captain of the North Stars, will be sidelined  the rest of the season, including any postseason games the North Stars  might play, because of a broken collarbone.

Rheaume, the  first female to play professional hockey, stopped 25 shots and gave up six  goals against the Cincinnati Cyclones on Saturday night, April 10.

But  Esposito said there was no truth to the report.  \\\"We were disappointed  with ESPN's irresponsible comment,\\\" Esposito said.  \\\"There is just no  substance to the rumor.\\\" Rumors have been swirling for the past two years  regarding a move by Tampa Bay, which is presently discussing plans to  build a new arena.

Matchups will be based on overall points with the  four division champions being placed in the first- or second-place seeds  in each conference and being assured of home-ice in the first two playoff  rounds. All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except  matchups between Central and Pacific teams.  Those series will rotate 2-3- 2 to reduce travel.  In those cases, the team with the most regular-season  points will choose whether to start the series at home or away.  -----  - Draft news:          Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in  June, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one  goaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion  drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction  between forwards and defensemen.         First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down  from the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and  Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.         Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of  one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is  that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.         At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises  will have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total  of 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa  Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two  new teams.         Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority  drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst  records. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The  expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose,  Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.         The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry  Draft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new  teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in  1994.          The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the  1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a  delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.  -----   - League news:  Disputes:    The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary  arbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

CHL: Fort Worth Fire, Wichita Thunder, Dallas Freeze, Tulsa Oilers, Memphis  River Kings, Oklahoma City Blazers    Six non-affiliated teams play a 60 game schedule extending from early  November to mid March. Each team is owned by the league, with local  interests controlling day to day operations. Each team has a $100,000  salary cap for 17 total players (16 dress up). Unlike the ECHL, players  are not limited to three years in the league.   A Western Division may be added to the Central Hockey League for the 93- 94 season if the plans of CHL president Ray Miron materialize.  Miron  confirmed that El Paso, Amarillo, Tuscon, and Albuquerque are cities under  consideration for the Western Division, which would play some interlocking  games with the Eastern Division.  Meanwhile, San Antonio and Houston are  close to being confirmed as the league's newest members.  -----   - Major League Hockey           A new hockey league with franchises throughout the United States  and Canada will begin play in the fallof 1993, officials announced  Wednesday, February 10.         Major League Hockey was founded by Roy Boe, former president of  the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League and the New York/New  Jersey Nets of the American and National Basketball associations.         According to Boe, the league will debut with six to eight teams  playing a schedule of approximately 80 games. Franchise applications have  been received from groups in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit,  Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, San Francisco, Saskatoon, Toronto  and Worcester, Mass., Boe said.         Although the league will not raid existing leagues to stock its  rosters, Boe said it will seek the ``world's finest hockey players.''         Boe said league play will have an international flair and  discussed implementing some rules which are reminiscent of those of the  IIHF.         ``We're removing the red line, moving the goal nets forward and  eliminating all tie games,'' said Boe.         The MLH office will operate out of Stamford, Conn.  -----   - British Premier Division:    contacts:   Neil A.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:    Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?  A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in  and around Montreal. Hence they were called \\\"Les Habitants\\\" (natives of  Montreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.    Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?  A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to  signify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer  existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.   Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?  A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is  a weekly journal with up-to-date info. Phone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US) Phone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)    Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in  the NHL?  A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1  chances.    Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?  A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when  a goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a  +, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short- handed goals do count for +/-.    Q: What is the five-hole?  A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones:  (1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower  right, and (5) five-hole.    Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?  A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven  series were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a  game, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.   Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?  A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever  to play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for  the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis  Blues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat  Expo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine  shots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately  lost the game, 6-4.   Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?  A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed  the richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be  worth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7  million a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.   Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?  A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National  Basketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey  League, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as  assistant general counsel. He became the league's chief legal officer in  September of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell  University in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.   Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?  A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and  Colonial Hockey Leagues.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------   9.

Althouhg I have never seen stats on this subject, I am pretty    >sure that Jagr had more points per minute played that Francis.  When    >you add to that Jagr's better +/- rating, I think it becomes evident    >that Jagr had a better season- not that Francis had a bad one.    >       Actually, what I think has become more evident, is that you are determined to      flaunt your ignorance at all cost.  Jagr did not have a better season than      Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of      hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty      plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.       Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice      time per game and some measure of its \\\"quality\\\" (i.e., is the player put out      in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up      against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would      much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious      merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.  Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play.  In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get 90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.  (By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games). \",\"Has anyone got multiverse to work ?

What happens to a Russian, to a Czech, does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans, who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these human animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone comes to me and says, \\\"I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them\\\", then I would have to say, \\\"you are a murderer of your own blood because if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, and they are the sons of German mothers. They are our own blood\\\".    Extract from Himmler's address to party comrades, September 7 1940 [\\\"Trials of Wa Criminals\\\", Vol. IV, p. 1140] ------------------------------------------------------------------ If any Pole has any sexual dealing with a German woman, and by this I mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right in front of his camp. Then the others will not do it. Besides, provisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish women and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this kind is out of the question.  The women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp. This we must do, unless these one million Poles and those hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict untold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no avail in this case. It would be better if we did not have them at all - we all know that - but we need them.  \",\"    As far as I can see, one of the big differences between Davidians and Christians is in who they follow.  I have sometimes tried to put myself in the feet of one of Jesus's disciples.  Basically, they gave up a lot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to follow Jesus.  So what is the difference?  It is quite plain.  Jesus was good and David Koresh was not.  The problem is, I think, is that we try to legislate what is good and what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance, there are thousands of  laws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often, it is hard to bring people to justice, because it is not possible to find a legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just, then we could tell them to administer justice fairly, and justice would be followed.  But since judges don't always get it right, we have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches of other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect (the justice of man) into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justice system in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.  There is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation more than the material being presented.  So we might consider  a ranting Christian to be bad, but an eloquent person from another religion to be good.  This goes along with the American desire to protect the Constitution at all costs, even if it allows people to do bad things.   I think that it is the message that is important.  If a man is presenting a false message, even if he is ever ever so mild mannered, then that man is performing a tremendous disservice.  I know that I am rambling here.  I guess that what I am trying to say is that we shouldn't be looking for principles that tell us why the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow and worship a person.  But it is important to choose the right person. It is simple.  Choose Jesus, and you got it right.  Choose anyone else, and you got it wrong.  Why?  Because Jesus is the begotten son of God, and nobody else is.  Jesus was without sin, and nobody else was.\",\"From: pmetzger@snark.shearson.com (Perry E.

My 1975 Saab 99 didn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In addition to the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another set integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who don't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic growth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out of the front fender, which incorporated amber \\\"parking lights\\\", amber side marker lights/reflectors, white \\\"cornering lamps\\\" (like American luxury cars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators on, and white \\\"backup lights\\\" aimed towards the back of the car when you have selected reverse gear.

What he is saying is that the next step beyond what you propose is the permanent bugging of potential criminals.  This may not, on the surface, sound like a bad thing, but who defines what a potential criminal is? If the government of the day decides that being a member of an opposition party makes you a potential criminal then openly defying the government becomes a lethal practice, this is not conducive to a free society.  Mathew is saying that implanting electronic surveillance devices upon people is an impropriety upon that person, regardless of what type of crime or what chance of recidivism there is. Basically you see the criminal justice system as a punishment for the offender and possibly, therefore, a deterrant to future offenders. Mathew sees it, most probably, as a means of rehabilitation for the offender.

(Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.) Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:  1) They don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is  still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the  load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground  return), so you still get ground and power line bounce.   2) They do help a lot with on-chip loads, as I had with the high load  on the clock lines.   3) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high  frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff  capacitors, since the RC time constant is too large.  What I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich,  but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent  diff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly  lines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probably  omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,  using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high  resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).  4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with  slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for  output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.  I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for  a MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I  needed.

My problem is,  I don't like xpr. It gives (at least, the X11R4 version does) louzy output: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me. Instead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, and lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel) image to black and white dots.  So: if you have a PostScript printer, try:  xwdtopnm <xwdfile> | # convert to PPM  [ppmtopgm |]  # .. to graylevel for smaller file to print  pnmtops -noturn | # .. to PostScript  lpr   # print  pnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care: If you want your image to be 4\\\" wide, use:  pnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4 -noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it  is high) -width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below) -scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a  width less than 4\\\", and will thus be printed smaller than 4\\\" wide.  If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4\\\", and  will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified  paper width.   In short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size,  but it will not blow it up automatically.  Hope this helps.

So, why should we judge religion without having experienced it?  People have said that religion is bad by any account, and that it is in no way useful, etc., but I don't totally agree with this.  Of course, we cannot really say how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion, but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it.  So basically, we can not judge whether religion is the right route for a given individual, or even for a general population.  We can say that it is not best for us personally (at least, you can choose not to use religion--might be hard to try to find out its benefits, as you state above).\",\"Hi!

Open it up and look for the power amp \\\"ICs\\\".  They'll be fairly obvious.  Replace the one connected to the dead output.    Well, one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp chips.  Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the input of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to both chips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.    If you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an outboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good enough.  This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone and balance controls too).  If you take off from the center and ground legs of the volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably  before the other controls).    If the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you should probably forget the whole thing. \",\"Here are the final stats for the CHL for the 1992-1993 season.

The NEC Adapter does not do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into the correct pinout but do not switch the Macs output into VGA mode.  Do I have to make one of these or does someone already have one made-up??  The following is the Apple spec for the LC cpu VGA Cable adapter. I'm assuming that the Powerbooks/Duos will work with the same adapter(?);   Macintosh LC to VGA   The Macintosh LC can supply a 640 x 480, VGA timed signal for use with VGA monitors by using an adapter cable.  The standard Macintosh LC supports VGA to 16 colors, and with the optional 512K VRAM SIMM, the VGA monitor is supported to 256 colors.   Note:     The Macintosh LC supplies signals capable of driving TTL level           inputs.  However, some low impedance input VGA monitors do not work           with the Macintosh LC.   To connect a Macintosh LC to a VGA monitor, you need to make an adapter cable from the Macintosh LC video connector to the VGA monitor.  Following is the pinout description for the adapter cable:   Macintosh LC        VGA Video Connector     Pin     Signal Name ---------------     ----    ----------- 1                   6       Red ground 2                   1       Red video signal 5                   2       Green video signal 6                   7       Green ground 9                   3       Blue video signal 13                  8       Blue ground 15                  13      /HSYNC 12                  14      /VSYNC 14                  10      HSYNC ground 7,10                nc      SENSE1 & SENSE2 tied together   VGA monitors are identified by shorting pin 7 to pin 10 on the Macintosh LC video connector.  The Macintosh LC grounds pin 7 on its video connector, which results in pulling down pin 10 and gives the correct monitor ID for a VGA monitor.\",\"I have a Sega Genesis (barely used) that IUd like to sell with the following games:  Sonic the Hedgehog (I) Revenge of Shinobi Thunderforce III  I'm asking $160 OBO.

It is clear that Mr. Wingate intends to continue to post tangential or unrelated articles while ingoring the Challenges themselves.  Between the last two re-postings of the Challenges, I noted perhaps a dozen or more posts by Mr. Wingate, none of which answered a single Challenge.    It seems unmistakable to me that Mr. Wingate hopes that the questions will just go away, and he is doing his level best to change the subject.  Given that this seems a rather common net.theist tactic, I would like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers, in the following manner:  1. Ignore any future articles by Mr. Wingate that do not address the Challenges, until he answers them or explictly announces that he refuses to do so.  --or--  2. If you must respond to one of his articles, include within it something similar to the following:      \\\"Please answer the questions posed to you in the Charley Challenges.\\\"  Really, I'm not looking to humiliate anyone here, I just want some honest answers.

That is--you get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree    to escrow your key. Otherwise you are on your own.  That's the disturbing part - use of other products IS voluntary, for now, and the press releases talk about the White House's unwillingness to decide that citizens have a right to good commercial crypto gear, and about how commercial alternatives will be permitted as long as they provide key escrow services.  That's a clear implication that they're considering banning alternatives.  Additionally, use of real alternatives ISN'T totally legal - you're not allowed to export really good crypto equipment except to the government's friends (e.g. the Australian government) you can only export even BAD crypto equipment with their permission, and the regulators who control the cellular telephone companies make sure there are only two competitors, so Joe's Garage Cellular can't start offering a secure service.  \",\"I have $30,000 as my budget.

As published in \\\"US Industrial Outlook 1993\\\"  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be \\\"adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.\\\"                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  \\\"Space Business Indicators\\\" in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year  through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request \\\"launch on demand\\\"  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/\\\"Spacelifter\\\" program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all \\\"ELV upgrade\\\" programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \\\"Spacelifter\\\"  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \\\"GO-AHEAD\\\"    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a \\\"Star Wars\\\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \\\"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\\\"     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst's report Morgan Stanley said \\\"We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.\\\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \\\"Aerokosmos\\\"  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \\\"Severkosmos\\\",  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one's a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \\\"the main  alternative rocket supplier\\\" for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of \\\"off the shelf\\\" components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the  satellite's communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \\\"Asiasat- 2\\\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based \\\"Asiasat\\\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's  aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \\\"made in Korea.\\\"   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

The difference now is that such strains have become virulent.  In the old days, such TB was weak.  It didn't spread to other people very easily and just infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance with medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains has been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9 drugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to such strains.  Now, however, with a virulent resistant strain, we are in more trouble, and measures to assure compliance may be necessary even if they entail force.  --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"From article <1993Apr15.024246.8076@Virginia.EDU>, by ejv2j@Virginia.EDU (\\\"Erik Velapoldi\\\"):\",\"Does anyone know what frequencies the wireless transmitter/receiver microphone systems that Radio Shack sells operate at?

No, I originally argued that the Second Amendment was \\\"a little bit and an anachronism.\\\"  These prohibiting laws are examples why the are an anachronism.  After all, laws in made by representatives of the  people.  These representatives of the people have already decided that the Second Amendment does not apply or is too broad in some cases.

I'm POSITIVE that the \\\"sealed warrant\\\" is not for child abuse.  What was it for?  Peobably weapons violations.  Janet Reno didn't say WORD ONE last night about weapons violations.  Why?

If gun control doesn't lower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue.   Does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much more common? Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the threat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim  in an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not be as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually _use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.) It isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a knife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more common. That's why it is important to look at the overall (not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of substitution, different criminal techinques of using different weapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.   \\\"Face\\\"? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn't too common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the usual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts to much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your pockets. Overall, I'd much rather be threatened with a gun than actually stabbed with a knife.   Actually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training in unarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman  without much problem.  You also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National Crime Survey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a knife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives in a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almost all prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore, using (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case) a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless of how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effective than guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a \\\"serious threat\\\" nearly as often as they do guns.\",\"This is an all-point team for the Canadian NHLers who are not playoff bound...

McLane is a businessman, and doesn't like excuses.  He makes a valid point that injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of the bench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solid outfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well..  The pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.  Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise OED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument.  Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job.  Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \\\"It is raining\\\" or \\\"Today is Tuesday\\\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to be true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning of \\\"deny\\\", not the everyday meaning.  The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular arrangement of words used to express it.  So \\\"God exists\\\" and \\\"There exists a God\\\" both express the same proposition.  An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \\\"a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition\\\".  An argument consists of three stages.  First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions.   Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \\\"because\\\", \\\"since\\\", \\\"obviously\\\" and so on.  (The phrase \\\"obviously\\\" is often viewed with suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to question it.  You can always say \\\"Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious\\\" when you've heard the explanation.)  Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of valid inference.  The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \\\"implies that\\\" or \\\"therefore\\\".  Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as \\\"therefore\\\", \\\"it follows that\\\", \\\"we conclude\\\" and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.  For example:  Every event has a cause (premise) The universe has a beginning (premise) All beginnings involve an event (premise) This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference) Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)  Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.  Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example, the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated  afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if  sometimes a little confusing.  Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some statements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:  \\\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,  or the Son of God.\\\"  This is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its  conclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll come to those later.)  Another example:  \\\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\\\"  The phrase \\\"do your duty to God\\\" is not a proposition, since it is neither true nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an argument.  Finally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \\\"A because B\\\".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the statement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then it is not an argument, it is an explanation.  For example:  \\\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not  start.\\\" -- This is an argument.  \\\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\\\"  -- This is an explanation.  There are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions -- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion is true.  An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid; however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments, and about how probable their premises are.  There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.  It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly  counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more carefully.  Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions.  For example:     All insects have wings (premise)    Woodlice are insects (premise)    Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)  Here, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false.  If the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true.  The argument is thus entirely valid.  More subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises, as in:     All fish live in the sea (premise)    Dolphins are fish (premise)    Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)  However, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \\\"truth table\\\" for implication.  The symbol \\\"=>\\\" denotes implication; \\\"A\\\" is the premise, \\\"B\\\" the conclusion.  \\\"T\\\" and \\\"F\\\" represent true and false respectively.  Premise Conclusion Inference    A        B        A=>B ----------------------------    F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference    F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.     T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion                              false, the inference must be invalid.     T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,                              the conclusion must be true.  A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound  argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments.  To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.  In everyday English the term \\\"fallacy\\\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair enough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or convincing.  So for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive.  ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)  The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \\\"might makes right\\\".  The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.  For example: \\\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM  Argumentum ad hominem is literally \\\"argument directed at the man\\\".  The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.  For example: \\\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\\\"  Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by  showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not argumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's testimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).  The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent's particular circumstances.  For example: \\\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue otherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?\\\"  This is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent's argument.  This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For  example:  \\\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing.  You're white.\\\"  This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is also known as \\\"poisoning the well\\\".  ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM  Argumentum ad ignorantium means \\\"argument from ignorance\\\".  This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true, a basic scientific principle.)  Examples: \\\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\\\"  \\\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has shown any proof that they are real.\\\"  Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty.  Also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can  validly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:  \\\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water, even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no such flood occurred.\\\"  In science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred, however.  ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM  This is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is  committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a  conclusion accepted.  For example:  \\\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me guilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan.\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM  This is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language.  For example:  \\\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\\\"  \\\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM  This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more likely it is that that proposition is correct.  ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM  The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion.  For example:  \\\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\\\"  This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly between:  \\\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\\\" and \\\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent  computer\\\"  Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable  whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.  THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT  The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose \\\"accidental\\\" circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific.  For example:  \\\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must dislike atheists.\\\"  This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.  CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION  This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases.  For example: \\\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are insincere.\\\"  SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER  A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization.  NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  These are known as False Cause fallacies.  The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For  example:  \\\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God cured me of the headache.\\\"  The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For  example:  \\\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons.\\\"  CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.  PETITIO PRINCIPII  This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached.  CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO  This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:  \\\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job.  Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open to blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office.\\\"  Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the  conclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees.  Another example is the classic:  \\\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God.\\\"  COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION  This is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded  question:  \\\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\\\"  The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination, when they ask questions like:  \\\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\\\"  Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:  \\\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\\\" or \\\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\\\"  IGNORATIO ELENCHI  The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument  supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion.  For example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.  Sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light.  EQUIVOCATION  Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument.  For example:  \\\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\\\"  AMPHIBOLY  Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing.  ACCENT  Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case, the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized.  For example, consider:  \\\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\\\" and \\\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\\\"  FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION  One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole.  For example:  \\\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very  lightweight.\\\"  The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:  \\\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses.\\\"  FALLACY OF DIVISION  The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like its opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:  \\\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\\\"  The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item.  For example:  \\\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\\\"  THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT  This argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful events.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event.  For example: \\\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana.\\\"  \\\"A IS BASED ON B\\\" FALLACIES / \\\"IS A TYPE OF\\\" FALLACIES  These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.  Examples: \\\"Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of history?\\\"  \\\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a form of Christianity?\\\"  \\\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?\\\"  AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form \\\"A implies B, B is true, therefore A is true\\\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for implication given earlier.  DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form \\\"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\\\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy.  Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has the form \\\"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\\\", where A does NOT in fact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is invalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about B.  CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL  This fallacy is an argument of the form \\\"If A then B, therefore if B then A\\\".  ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM  This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old, or because \\\"that's the way it's always been.\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM  This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else.  ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM  The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those with more money are more likely to be right.  ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM  The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam.  ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM  This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard.  An \\\"argumentum ad nauseum\\\" is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something.  BIFURCATION  Also referred to as the \\\"black and white\\\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist.  PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS  This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question.  NON SEQUITUR  A non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it.  RED HERRING  This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the points being made, towards a different conclusion.  REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION  Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.  SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF  The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.  STRAW MAN  The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position, then to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made.  THE EXTENDED ANALOGY  The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two  different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a  claim that those situations are analogous to each other.  This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about  anti-cryptography legislation:  \\\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\\\"  \\\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported  Martin Luther King.\\\"  \\\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the  struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\\\"  TU QUOQUE  This is the famous \\\"you too\\\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:  \\\"You're just being randomly abusive.\\\" \\\"So?  You've been abusive too.\\\"\",\"<< < For example: why does the universe exist at all?    <Whether there is a \\\"why\\\" or not we have to find it. This is Pascal's(?) wager. <If there is no why and we spend our lives searching, then we have merely <wasted our lives, which were meaningless anyway. If there is a why and we .. <Suppose the universe is 5 billion years old, and suppose it lasts another <5 billion years. Suppose I live to be 100. That is nothing, that is so small <that it is scary. So by searching for the \\\"why\\\" along with my friends here <on earth if nothing else we aren't so scared.   I find this view of Christianity to be quite disheartening and sad. The idea that life only has meaning or importance if there is a Creator does not seem like much of a basis for belief.   And the logic is also appalling: \\\"God must exist because I want Him to.\\\"   I have heard this line of \\\"reasoning\\\" before and wonder how prevalent it is. Certainly in modern society many people are convinced life is hopeless (or so the pollsters and newscasts state), but I don't see where this is a good reason to become religious.

Come on, Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant. Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders.   YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**. Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.  But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel doesn't have a game like that in him.   Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about Roussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah, Dom has played well too.   FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a team picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the same picture they sold in the programs in mid-season.

I don't like that method since I've seen guards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they got their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies.\",\"To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota:    From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people  in the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St.  Paul \\\"Pioneer Press\\\" wrote an article giving the \\\"inside scoop\\\" on the  issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible  candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic  Center (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty  confident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will  ultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other  two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the  inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name)  believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also,  because of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed  until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.   However, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed,  because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for  conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to  this mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future  viability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even  further.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of  knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging  Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met,  which may happen.  Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are  Hartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \\\" Ice Demons?\\\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't  been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the  Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in  as many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see  Hartford and Tampa show up there either. So, Minnesota may end up  getting another team, but it may take a few years.

They're shouting, \\\"Down with the  Armenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!\\\" My God, why is  that happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together well, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely  unexpected. And they were shouting, \\\"Long live Turkey!\\\" And they had flags, and they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he's  around 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I  can't make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something, and the children behind him are shouting, \\\"Tear the Armenians to pieces!\\\" and  \\\"Down with the Armenians!\\\" They shout it again, and then shout, \\\"Hurrah!\\\" The  people streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I  saw that there were women, too. I say, \\\"My God, there are women there too!\\\"  And my son says, \\\"Those aren't women, Mamma, those are bad women.\\\" Well we  didn't look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I  simply couldn't sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani  neighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \\\"Khalida, what's going on, what  happened?\\\" She says, \\\"Emma, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what  happened.\\\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks,  each second or third one had a white rod. They're waving the rods above their  heads as they walk, and the one who's out front, like a leader, he has a white stick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I  don't know.  My husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \\\"Oh  dear, I'm frightened, they're going to kill us I bet.\\\" And he says, \\\"What are  you afraid of, they're just children.\\\" I say, \\\"Everything that happens comes  from children.\\\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and  Vocational School. \\\"Don't fear,\\\" he said, \\\"it's nothing, nothing all that  bad.\\\" He didn't eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they broadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran.  When I heard that I couldn't settle down at all, I kept walking here and  there and I said, \\\"They're going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to  kill us.\\\" And he says, \\\"Don't be afraid.\\\" Then we heard--from the central  square, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shouting different things, and you couldn't hear every well. I say, \\\"You speak Azerbaijani well, listen to what they're saying.\\\" He says \\\"Close the window and go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\\\" He listened a bit and then  closed the window and went to bed, and told us, \\\"Come on, go to sleep, it's nothing.\\\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window until two in the morning watching. Well he's sick, and all of this was affecting him. I say, \\\"Igor, you go to bed, I'm going to go to bed in a minute too.\\\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed.  Things had calmed down slightly.  The 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \\\"Come on, Emma,  get up.\\\" I say, \\\"Today's my day off, let me rest.\\\" He says, \\\"Aren't you going  to make me some tea?\\\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \\\"Where are  you going?\\\" He says, \\\"I'm going out, I have to.\\\" I say, \\\"Can you really go  outside on a day like today? Don't go out, for God's sake. You never listen to me, I know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take  the car out of the garage, go without the car.\\\" And he says, \\\"Come on, close  the door!\\\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn't make it out, he probably said \\\"coward\\\" or something.  I closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up around the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after- noon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said, \\\"Khalida, was it our car?\\\" She says, \\\"No, no, Emma, don't be afraid, they were government cars and Zhigulis.'' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited, it was four o'clock, five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven I said, \\\"Oh, they've killed Shagen!\\\"  Tires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and I'm afraid, I'm  standing on the balcony and I'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God,  they've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten  o'clock and he still hadn't come home. And I'm afraid to go out. At ten o'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore, and from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside.  I'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I  don't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see  it. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \\\"Mamma,\\\" he says, \\\"look what they're doing over there!\\\" They were burning everything, and there  were police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing  on the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are  throwing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony  is shouting, \\\"What are you standing there for, burn it!\\\" When they threw the  television, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out  on her balcony and shouted, \\\"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those things, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their  home. Why are you burning them?\\\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \\\"Go  inside, go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in  your building or not?\\\" They meant Armenians, but they didn't say Armenians,  they said, \\\"of them.\\\" She says, \\\"No, no, no, none!\\\" Then she ran downstairs to our place, and says, \\\"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\\\" I say, \\\"They've killed Shagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won't be living for me without  Shagen. Let them kill us, too!\\\" She insists, saying, \\\"Emma, get out of here,  go to Khalida's, and give me the key. When they come I'll say that it's my  daughter's apartment, that they're off visiting someone.\\\" I gave her the key  and went to the neighbor's, but I couldn't endure it. I say, \\\"Igor, you stay  here, I'm going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa's . . . Papa's there.\\\"  Meanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and  Valery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in  the courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling,  and I didn't think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived in the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw an Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \\\"Madar,  Uncle Shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the  garage, let's at least bring the corpse into the house. \\\"He shouts, \\\"Aunt  Emma, where do you think you're going?! Go back into the house, I'll look for  him.\\\" I say, \\\"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar,  I'm coming too.\\\" Well he wouldn't let me go all the same, he says, \\\"You stay  here with us, I'm go look.\\\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \\\"Aunt  Emma, there's no one there, the garage is closed. \\\"Madar went off again and  then returned and said, \\\"Aunt Emma, they're already killed Alik, and Valery's  there . . . wheezing.\\\"  Madar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \\\"Don't go near him,  or we'll put you next to him.\\\" He got scared--he's young--and came back and  said, \\\"I'm going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take  Alik, maybe he'll live . . . \\\" They grew up together in our courtyard, they  knew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but not a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and  called, and called, and called--nothing.  I went upstairs to the neighbor's. Igor says, \\\"Two police cars drove up over  there, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still  lying where they were, they're still lying there . . . \\\"We watched out the window until four o'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn't take my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six o'clock in the morning I got up and said, \\\"Igor, you stay here at home, don't go out, don't go anywhere, I'm going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or alive . . . let me go . . . I've got the keys from work.\\\"  At six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another  doctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \\\"Doctor, is  Shagen there?\\\" He says, \\\"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\\\" I  wanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. There were only four people in there, they said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. They said, \\\"Shagen's not here, he's alive somewhere, he'll come back.\\\"  It's already seven o'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck with three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with them. I say, \\\"Sara Baji [\\\"Sister\\\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they've probably brought Shagen.\\\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back and says, \\\"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it's a younger person.\\\" Now Shagen  just happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they  said it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \\\"Doctor, they've  brought Shagen in dead.\\\" He says, \\\"Why are you carrying on like that, dead,  dead . . . he's alive.\\\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back  the look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They knew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \\\"Doctor,  is it Shagen?\\\" He says, \\\"No, Emma, it's not he, it's somebody else entirely.\\\"  I say, \\\"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I'll find out all the same anyway,  if not today, then tomorrow.\\\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the office. He says, \\\"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\\\" Another one of our  colleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous  condition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't Shagen. A few minutes  later another colleague comes in and says, \\\"Oh, poor Emma!\\\" When she said it  like that there was no hope left.     That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured  people.  At night someone took me home. I said, \\\"Igor, Papa's been killed.\\\"  On the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital:  I had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is  surrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \\\"Hey, citizen, where  are you going?\\\" I say, \\\"I work here,\\\" and from inside someone shouts, \\\"Yes,  yes, that's our cook, let her in.\\\" I went right to the head doctor's office and there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to work with us at the hospital. He says, \\\"Emma, Shagen's been taken to Baku. In the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\\\" I say, \\\"Doctor, how will I bury him?\\\" He says, \\\"We're taking care of all that, don't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. Where did you spend the night?\\\" I say, \\\"I was at home.\\\" He says, \\\"What do you mean you were at home?! You were at home alone?\\\" I say, \\\"No, Igor was there too.\\\" He says, \\\"You can't stay home, we're getting an ambulance right now, wait just one second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance right now, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here like a patient, and you'll stay here and we'll se~ later what to do next ...\\\" His last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor's name is Izyat Jamalogli Sadukhov.  The \\\"ambulance\\\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a  patient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the  hospital until the 4th.  Some police car came and they said, \\\"Emma, let's go.\\\" And the women, our  colleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \\\"Where are  you taking her?\\\" I say, \\\"They're going to kill me, too . . . \\\" And the investigator says, \\\"Why are you saying that, we're going to make a positive identification.\\\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I still can't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \\\"Let's  go, we need to be certain, maybe it's not Shagen.\\\" And when I saw the caskets, lying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \\\"I can't look, no.\\\" The investigator says, \\\"Are there any identifying marks?\\\" I say, \\\"Let me see the clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I'll recognize them.\\\" He says,  \\\"Isn't they're anything on his body?\\\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his  finger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had been injured at work . . .  They brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they  brought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \\\"Oh,  they burned him!\\\" I shouted, I don't know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat  down, I don't remember. And that investigator says, \\\"Well fine, fine, since  we've identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since he has seven gold teeth . . . \\\"  On the 4th they told me: \\\"Emma, it's time to bury Shagen now.\\\" I cried, \\\"How,  how can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he's sick? I should inform  his relatives, he has three sisters, I can't do it by myself.\\\" They say, \\\"OK,  you know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they  get here from Yerevan? There's no transportation, it s impossible.\\\"  He was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in  Sumgait. They asked me, \\\"Where do you want to bury him?\\\" I said, \\\"I want to  bury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\\\" I'm  shouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \\\"Do you know what  it means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\\\" I say, \\\"What do you mean,  arson? Don't they know what's going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that they killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don't have anyone  anymore.\\\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He says, \\\"Let's bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year,  if it calms down, I'll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \\\"  Our trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the investigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then at the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime.  Then they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said,  \\\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\\\" He says, \\\"Yes.\\\" \\\"Well look, here you're  describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\\\" He says,  \\\"Yes.\\\" \\\"And now you're telling it differently?\\\" He says, \\\"Well maybe I  forgot!\\\" Like that.  The witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going along Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a  Volga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were  involved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it's unclear who--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side of the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports  jacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \\\"What's your nationality?\\\" He  says, \\\"Armenian.\\\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \\\"If he's an Armenian, kill him, kill him!\\\" They started beating him, they broke seven of his ribs, and his heart . . . I don't know, they did something there, too  . . . it's too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he  had an armature shaft. He says, \\\"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush,  that's where I got it.\\\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he had already had it. He said, \\\"I hit him twice,\\\" he said, \\\" . . . once or twice on the head with that rod.\\\" And he said that when he started to beat him  Shagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said,  \\\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment, killing someone,\\\" he says, \\\"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or not?\\\" I said, \\\"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you came back to hit him again?\\\" He went back and looked and he was already dead. \\\"After that,\\\" that bastard Tale said, \\\"after that I went home.\\\"  I said, \\\"You . . . you . . . little snake,\\\" I said, \\\"Are you a thief and a  murderer?\\\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They were taken. He says he didn't take them  When they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was other people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned it, that hasn't been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \\\"How can you  have the trial when you don't know who burned the car?\\\" He said something, but I didn't get what he was saying. But I said, \\\"You still haven't straightened  everything out, I think that's unjust.\\\"  When they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him.  In the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80 percent of his body . . .  And I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good  craftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his  own hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the  time. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the  Army. And now they're fatherless...  I couldn't sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15 years' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn't know what to do with myself, I said, \\\"How can that be? You,\\\" I said, \\\"you are  saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years'  deprivation of freedom?\\\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \\\"Let me at that creep, with my bare hands I'll . . . \\\" A relative restrained me, and there were all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,\\\" This isn't a  Soviet trial, this is unjust!\\\" That's what I shouted, l said it and left . . .  I said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street,  they were shouting, \\\"Long live Turkey!\\\" and \\\"Glory to Turkey!\\\" And during the  trial I said to that Ismailov, \\\"What does that mean, 'Glory to Turkey'?\\\" I  still don't understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet  Union. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still don't understand why \\\"Glory to Turkey!\\\" I asked that question twice and got no answer . . . No one answered me . . .

Hope you like it.      Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti        Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti,     the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven. She was a cheerful     girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but     one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.      The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on     the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-     nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally     arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and     give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon     on the  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love     we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to     die rather than commit a mortal sin.      Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy     Eucharist. Her  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father's     absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the rest  of  the     day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is     until         -4-            her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.     Thus ended the happiest day of Maria's life.      Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling     little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her     mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband, Maria     took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.     She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the     Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti's, owning     a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other     children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she     did the Holy Will of God.      During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son) twice     made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On     both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro's     strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she     even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria lived     in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.       On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  \\\"get  a     handkerchief,\\\"  as he  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath     the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the     baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered     what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a     91/2\\\"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told     him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He     stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia     instantly realized what he was up to. \\\"No, No, No! Do  not touch     me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!\\\" At this point Alessandro     held the knife over Maria's chest, who was now on the floor.      \\\"Will you or will you not?\\\" Maria gathered all her energy. \\\"No I     will  not, Alessandro,  no!\\\"   She had chosen her martyrdom over     sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the     knife  into   Maria's  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to     his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the     knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying     of the baby Teresa on  the  landing  brought  the attention  to     Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended     and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find     Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.     When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   \\\"He     wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.\\\"      The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro away.     As the  ambulance carried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd     followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for     poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First     Communion         -5-            came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.     He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  \\\"Yes.  For the     love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me     in Paradise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have.\\\" Maria     died at about three o'clock.      Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria's  death  but     because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in     prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-     ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of     a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to     him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God's par-     don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony     in Maria's  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,     on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the     first mother ever to be present at her daughter's canonisation.      May St. Maria Goretti help us  to be  pure  and  grant  us  the     strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.

Are you related to 'Arromdian' of ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle? If you feel that you can simply act as a fascist Armenian  governmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly  embarrassed. This is not a lecture to another historical revisionist  and a genocide apologist, but a fact. This time, fascist x-Soviet Armenian  Government will not get away with the genocide of 204,000 Azeri men, women  and children. Not a chance.   The SUNDAY TIMES 8 March 1992  Morgues fill as Azeris head for all-out war  -------------------------------------------  Thomas Goltz, the first to report the massacre by Armenian soldiers in  the worst violence since the breakup of the Soviet Union, reports from  Agdam  ------  Khojaly used to be a barren town, with empty shops and treeless dirt  roads. Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier  times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off  the map.  .......  As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of  Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt  that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been  the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke  apart.  .......  I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and  people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut Ezoya,  a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the  town, called her community \\\"sitting ducks, ready to get shot\\\". She and  her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.  .......  \\\"The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and  the government does nothing.\\\" Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,  said. \\\"Next they will drive us out or kill us all,\\\" said Dilbar, his  wife. The couple, their three sons and three daughters were killed in  the assault, as were many other people I had spoken to.  ......  \\\"It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have to cross.  There was a road, and the first units of the column ran across then  all hell broke loose. Bullets were raining down from all sides. we had  just entered their trap.\\\"  The azeri defenders picked off one by one. Survivors say that Armenian  forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything moved in  the gullies. A video taken by an azeri cameraman, wailing and crying  as he filmed body after body, showed a grizzly trail of death leading  towards higher, forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge  from the Armenians.  \\\"The Armenians just shot and shot and shot,\\\" said Omar Veyselov, lying  in hospital in Agdam with sharapnel wounds. \\\"I saw my wife and  daughter fall right by me.\\\"  People wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the  loved ones. Some vented their fury on foreigners: \\\" Where is my  daughter, where is my son ?\\\" wailed a mother. \\\"Raped. Butchered. Lost.\\\"  Azerbaijan has said as many as 1,000 refugees were killed as they  tried to flee. The Armenians have denied this, saying the civilians  were caught in \\\"crossfire\\\".  .......

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH  ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO  INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...  As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw  the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as  they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to  journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts  of the hills.  The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING  of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians  last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death  or missing...   Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter  as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there  was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer  ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We  swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon  under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.  We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round  again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a  valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung  round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired  repeated blasts.  Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting  had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in  fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.  I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,  its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on  \\\"our side\\\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a  search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.  Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two  M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed  flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second  crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains  and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters  were there to give covering fire if necessary.  The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet  armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani  official told us that there were now five former Soviet military  helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \\\"They have  signed contracts to fly for us,\\\" he said. The helicopter we engaged  in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian  pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.  We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an  heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer  white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four  corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an  Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies  on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back  towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before  the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.  Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the  civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were  covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor  mortis. They had been shot.  What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,  and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY  DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that most people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail- order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily by law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep  them honest about acquiring parts.   For Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is a HUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily. Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are not as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the  plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy, then, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it on a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts, more traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.  Mike\",\"I have a new 25 MHz Motorola 68040 that I am willing to sell if I get a good enough offer.

This is a triple 2-to-1 transmission-gate analog multiplexer, with positive and negative power supplies (can be run from a single-ended supply as well).  With dual supplies, the logic inputs still range from ground (0 Volts) to VDD.

When the analog switch is closed, the amp is inverting-gain-of-one.  With the switch open, it is non-inverting-gain-of-one.  You can clean up the circuit to trim out input offset current if this hurts the balance (this would show up as carrier feed-through).  For high frequencies, the slew-rate of the opamp might cause problems, especially if it isn't symmetrical (and it usually isn't). \",\"10 month old stereo system for sale.

You drink and drive, you pay. No smiley. \",\"I told some friends of mine two weeks ago that Koresh was dead.  The FBI and the BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their stupidity and lies.      Now before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as  a bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.  They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet,  whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into town on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and  wondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers. First, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they didn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got it.  After the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were coming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that. Well, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.  Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to them they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised Koresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                   The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he  \\\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out. His grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise David Koresh.\\\"  Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a logical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.  Here's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must be done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?  I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how much money this was costing.  That was the start of the \\\"Justification\\\" part part of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.  But, back to the plan.  It is considered \\\"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\\\" to execute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.  They knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not sure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the  compound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.  I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR (Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were subjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical  agent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.  I have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of thing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.  We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these people 51 days.    I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole thing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks changed my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:  \\\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\\\"  It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.  One more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic weapons on the premises.

As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye  stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population  there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately,  the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass  graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed  what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.  The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of  oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot  officials and their violation of the co-founder status of  the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat  engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution  to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked  Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and  only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues  consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories  to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply  was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at  all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which  was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece.  Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish  population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population.  The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded Greeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their  autonomy in a separate republic.  Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would rather not be involved with the island. But, given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights, liberties and their very lives.

Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to education, to establish a family and have children, to human dignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are more important to human existence that the rights of states.  2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.  3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an unresolved conflict exists.  4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples and nations.  5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.  6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional political means have failed.  7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the land, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.  8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice. When people love, they share.  Having stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.  1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew and the other Palestinian-Arab.  2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner, although born in areas under current Isreali control, is not entitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.  3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For the second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each subsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.   4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and Christian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of governments and international organizations.  5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on 'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the Middle-East in a graceful manner.  Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will attempt to identify some of these:  1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However, it is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation.  2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the 'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but Israeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be defeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights (see above)  3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their point of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People overrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of human rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar Bronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing assimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its effects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see above)  4.      It may objected that only a few people in Israel/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes.  5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has merits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than $3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government and by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the Middle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a non-segregated society in that worn-torn land.  I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment.\",\"This is the final public update to my dragon magazine auction.

One you have supplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the future (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating high-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less), I am not  going to care much about US confidentiality, am I?  Only people like the real me, who does care about travelling to various countries for business reasons, will sit up and follow laws like this, but I would contend that we're not the main threat.  I also have grave doubts whether an algorythm widely distributed in silicon could possibly be called \\\"classified.\\\"  It's like handing out military secrets to the whole world in envelopes marked \\\"don't open me.\\\"  I can imagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to a trial.  One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.   Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable for a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware? In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you just swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of that cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that it would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search algorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware. I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.   However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its  designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion  of such techniques seems credible.  Hmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name \\\"Clipper\\\" for this device. :) \",\" Oh come on, Silly, all you have to do is cut a hole in your hood and  put a tube there so you can get to the oil fill hole.

This was a heresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD.  It grew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia and by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believes that Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which is correct), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfect harmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesus came in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human will.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject to original sin. It is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies.

Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll try to get better.  Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far, only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.  Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K.  vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.   I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of excuses.    I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.  From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I  see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see the dialog:   Me:  \\\"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\\\"   BK:  \\\"There is no truck.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around at look.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at      the oncoming truck.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around or you will run over.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\\\"  Me:  \\\"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing       to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\\\"       I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.  BK:  \\\"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.       Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\\\"       And by the way, I really have an open mind.\\\"   So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?     I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have. I can now see the truck behind Brian.  My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment, Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. \",\"  I recommend the book \\\"Adams _v_ Texas\\\", the story of a man (Adams) who was sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit.

My beliefs are those things which I find to be true based on my experience of the world.  This experience includes study of things that I may not have experienced directly.  But even then, I can only understand the studies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to what I have experienced.  Which means that by beliefs about God are directly related to my experience of God.  Having experienced God, I try to make sense of that experience.  I study religion and read the Bible.  I find things that echo what I have already experienced.  Out of this I build my beliefs.  I also find things that don't match my experience.  That doesn't make them false.  They just don't match my experience.  Maybe I will understand that stuff later.  I don't know.  Maybe all of my beliefs are wrong.  I can change my beliefs.  If someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what. Neither of us are necessarily wrong.  Someone else is making sense out of a different set of experiences.  Even though we have different explanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that the underlying experiences are similar.  Some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one form, and usually has a single revelation.  The more dogmatic and inflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to an outsider.  There is another approach possible, however.  God is a mystery.  I am trying to solve the mystery, so I look at the evidence available to me.  I try to arrive at the best understanding that I can based on the evidence.  New evidence may cause me to change my understanding.  When I encounter someone with a different belief than my own, it isn't a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discover something new about this mystery I can never fully comprehend.

The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for   its stone walls had only window slits.

Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.  The came a shrill wailing.   Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about  house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in  clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen  were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.   'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape  over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked  breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by  afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and  the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.   At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward  Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and   tough, through dense scrub.

I'd be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain everything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and then on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug and we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably didn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit they wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or something.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they report every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating that the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to happen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific. There are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking. Patients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks to themselves properly.  I'm sure Herman is going to \\\"go ballistic\\\", but so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been reported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will refuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for PDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need. I am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the domain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient. For common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help quite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the computer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly, physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have, as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked things that the patients should have found out from their physician but didn't.  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either. Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They won't be as afraid to ask the system, we hope. --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\" Ref: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade  MAGI:   [Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting  ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous  _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which  most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the  second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of  the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi  to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]    The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain  etymology. It may originally have meant \\\"member of the tribe,\\\" as in the Avestan compound mogu-tbish (\\\"hostile to a member of the tribe\\\"). This meaning would have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \\\"member of the priestly tribe\\\" and perhaps to \\\"priest\\\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is probably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \\\"Magoi\\\" as one of the six tribes of the Medes.   For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were responsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their knowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the Great (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political and civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period (Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by Darius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.   The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.   There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the Avestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \\\"gift\\\"), is not without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found, in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of purity, or separation of the \\\"mixture\\\" of the two opposed principles of spirit and matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \\\"chorus,\\\" from the root mangh, which is said to mean \\\"sing the magic song\\\" (Nyberg, 1966) and has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the Avestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite a recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore the Avestan term for \\\"priest,\\\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is  perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis  (Gershevitch, 1964).   The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in particular derives from an older form, magupati (\\\"head of the Magi\\\"). During the Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of a hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\\\"the high priest of high priests\\\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.   The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl., khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it. The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons of putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the Parsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this rite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was in vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with wax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples of Central Asia.   The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a ritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also known for the practice of killing harmful, or \\\"Ahrimanical,\\\" animals (khrafstra) such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants, tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of felt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their breath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition that is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was that of the priesthood: white.   In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this they were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible for teaching the prince the \\\"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\\\" and thus the \\\"cult of the gods.\\\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and master of himself.   During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of Gaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself Smerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation - the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media, in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.   No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were renowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of the greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in Bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were also known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism; this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek, like \\\"goes,\\\" \\\"expert in the magic arts\\\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.   To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called western Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must have been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.   The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical historians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism, belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology and eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted Zoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and placed themselves under his venerable name.   Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the Zoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \\\"the law-abjuring daivas\\\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and practices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the supreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.; Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it has been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own priesthood, would be very strange.   The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the first millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to us especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles of the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\\\"beneficent spirit\\\") and Angra Mainyu (\\\"hostile spirit\\\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans- formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro- astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the Mesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known to the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which we give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]   Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises on the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have survived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of wisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an abundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).   Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]   The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the religious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce, 1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of Iran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to establish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures in the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar and Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.\",\"Hello,  I have a Hayes 9600 moden with no cables or manuals.

Some of the land was in fact given to the   Jews by the United Nations, quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab   absentee landlords. Present claims are based on prior ownership (purchase   from aforementioned absentee landlords) award by the United Nations in the   partition of the Palestine mandate territory, and as the result of   defensive wars fought against the Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, et al.  *** First, I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the   idea that the West Bank is theirs. Since,  however, I agree with those who   claim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West   bank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion   to attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis   promptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining   possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats   national suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it   is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them   and the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs   continues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they   can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West   Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is   the small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West   Bank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even   leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't   going to propose giving up Jerusalem. If he did, he'd get run out of town   on a rail. \",\"I can only comment on the Kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasant surprise is Alex Zhitnik. He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but he's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he were more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided  to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be MVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the league's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the  rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer goals than Hartford.

Velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside of stock airboxes on a number of bikes.  At a tuned engine rpm, the stacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air rushing in. Air momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside long after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke. Shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from escaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion chambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing) to the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they design for shock waves.\",\" No, it isn't.

But you have been courteous and therefore received courtesy in return.  This person instead has posted one of the worst arguments I have ever seen made from the pro-Christian people.  I've known several Jesuits who would laugh in his face if he presented such an argument to them.  Let's ignore the fact that it's not a true trilemma for the moment (nice word Maddi, original or is it a real word?) and concentrate on the liar, lunatic part.  The argument claims that no one would follow a liar, let alone thousands of people.  Look at L. Ron Hubbard.  Now, he was probably not all there, but I think he was mostly a liar and a con-artist.  But look at how many thousands of people follow Dianetics and Scientology.  I think the  Baker's and Swaggert along with several other televangelists lie all the time, but look at the number of follower they have.  As for lunatics, the best example is Hitler.  He was obviously insane, his advisors certainly thought so.  Yet he had a whole country entralled and came close to ruling all of Europe.  How many Germans gave their lives for him?  To this day he has his followers.  I'm just amazed that people still try to use this argument.  It's just so obviously *wrong*.                \",\"  HEAR HEAR!!!

Gay people are and will con- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may be unaware of all the statistica \\\"findings\\\" concerning African-Americans that have been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias against African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances, but there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public scoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case. Fortunately African-Americans had \\\"whites\\\" who supported their 'cause' and public sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was even a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty much legal to discriminate against them.  I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something, that is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society, including gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation and making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love, and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular to do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes in the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actually sho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially within their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian community for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists against the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and treated as runaway slaves for being \\\"nigger-lovers\\\" and such.  I guess I've decided the challenge is worth it.  In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic story centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight who have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of one case where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject their gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they began to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.  I'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0 raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values Coalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner support within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more oppressive legisation against gays.  Perhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in the Middle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands in witch hunts and inquisitions.  The message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay rights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even hatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change the results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the final effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a \\\"conditional\\\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This is sure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \\\"unconditional\\\" love, one that calls people \\\"just as they are.\\\"  Sure there are things that will 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that need to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things like left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \\\"other people's expectations.\\\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many people a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their own sense of pseuper-spirituality.  This is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with something very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but I firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation on thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfully removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation, but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society. Gay people are not criminals.  Another interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic church in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self- admitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently been going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were voluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that was how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing happen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends recently told me he was \\\"approached\\\" by someone who is going through the reparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.  These are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not the call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in Colorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over Colorado called \\\"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\\\" (I forget the whole definition off hand, but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto is \\\"Working for a fag-free America\\\" with an implicit advocation for violence.  This is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are embracing.  We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from organizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good purpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of excluding people.  The Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \\\"include\\\" people.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful, especially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto itself.  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?

We were able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the Palestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid - currently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous statement: \\\"You look for me !\\\", i.e., I'am not making any more efforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid's point of view, Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew or the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the Palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly MERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his government's and his party's lack of action for human rights and peace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether they would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists' perspective this is the best government because it is THEIR government, regardless of what it does.  These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the future of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to dictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step towards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin's government, and from their point of view the expulsions were a marginal byproduct of this \\\"government of peace\\\", which need not disturb the routine course of events. Likewise the \\\"Rabinic\\\" policies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in the suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.  But the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces itself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has lost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian workers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel Aviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing to propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from the Palestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be able to harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.  Meron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): \\\"...The liberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical separation and 'the future of the territories', must come to understand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab workers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement designed for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that their ideological support for separation only provides 'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status quo>.  Enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the ruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears its burden. [.....].  \\\"Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal, humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether this position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off responsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to thus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is very easy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at the disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue all their interests, but is barred to the Arabs...\\\".\",\" The best info I have seen so far is the article \\\"Joystick Metrics: Measuring physical properties through the PC's joystick port\\\" by Michael Covington in the May 1985 issue of PC Tech Journal.  It talks about how to read all kinds of things (voltage, current, resistance) in BASIC, and even includes code for a simple \\\"oscilloscope\\\" display.  It's possible to read the joystick port directly if you don't want to use BASIC.  The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical Reference under Options and Adapters.  You have to provide some millisecond resolution timing functions, but that's a subject which has appeared many times in articles from Dr. Dobb's, Circuit Cellar Ink, etc.  Look for the public domain ztimer package on wuarchive.

The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV In order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than that.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a PC.  Before you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a low distortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  Digital Domain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitized waveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on the spectrum.  That's should give you a good indication of the design. (That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed - I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)  If you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking at the MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) complete sampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and it uses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated from the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog design guide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.  They claim a -77db max (-85 typ.) THD.  Looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces  A evaluation kit is available.  Might want to give these nice folks a call.  1-800-998-8800 or fax: (408)737-7194 and (408) 737-7600 ext4000 for application assistance.  This assumes that you can build your own DAS and write your own software. (Hey you can get the MAX121 as a free sample just by calling the 1-800 #)   I would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out of your system by looking at the noise level, otherwise you might be throwing out your money.

The first clause is not a condition, it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS, MILITIA OR NOT, that the people have a right to keep and bear arms.  This is NOT a right granted by the Constitution, it is a right presumed to exist by default.  The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the government from removing that right by stating very clearly the government shall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right.  Remember the Constitution is a bunch of negative things - things the government CANNOT do.  All rights, etc not epxressly given to the government go to the states and the PEOPLE (the same people the other 9 Amendments in the Bill of Rights talk about).

Mr. Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of \\\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\\\"  A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's expertise.  Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at USC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for \\\"Editor and Publisher\\\", a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field.  He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's fifth book on usage, \\\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\\\" has been in continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.  That sounds like an expert to me.  After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent the following letter:  \\\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.  \\\"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further, since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under oath to support, if necessary.\\\"  My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment, then concluded:  \\\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment. While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\\\"  After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political subject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity):  [Copperud:] \\\"The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a clause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb 'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia.  \\\"In reply to your numbered questions:  [Schulman:] \\\"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringed'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed' null and void?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,' 'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200 years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \\\"Since a well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'  [Schulman:] \\\"As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second Amendment to the following sentence,  \\\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,  \\\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?; and  \\\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure.  \\\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation.\\\"  Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his cover letter: \\\"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach any conclusion.\\\"  So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.  As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.  And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely. American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms, guaranteed by the Constitution.  And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.  it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?  Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution of the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

[1]  Born 1964 Secretary-Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization  Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan]   On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show, at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards  away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \\\"The Abyss.\\\"  Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at  the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation  whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it  was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if  someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There  were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that  large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well  mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an  Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that  they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do  to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded  a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move  over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone  recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina.  It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats.  Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis,  people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the  auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and  gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \\\"OK, we've  scared them enough, let's leave.\\\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to  me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of  \\\"anasha\\\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like  they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing  had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful  films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We  could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine,  and it was dark . . .  Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting,  something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially  listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to  make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation  wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,  policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors  there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some  naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well,  since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super  serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we  live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the  driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and  he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well,  OK . . .  So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was  happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation  was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \\\"Ka-ra-bagh,\\\" they're not going  to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had  come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to  cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma  down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though  nothing had happened.  That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and  didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't guess.  On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda,  Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and  no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that  morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda  Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, \\\"Don't they want Armenians? Well what  are they after, if they're already in that state?\\\" She says, no, nothing like  that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The  cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.  Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy  problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, \\\"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\\\" Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home  and told Mamma. Mamma said, \\\"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on.\\\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I  tell Lyuda, \\\"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see  you out.\\\" Mamma says, \\\"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can  see what the situation in town is.\\\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was  ready. Mamma says, \\\"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\\\" We sat down at the  table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything  out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television, and the show \\\"In Fairy-Tale Land\\\" was coming on.  We cleared the table.  We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't  see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people  . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's  an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story  buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20  people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see  several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not  killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of  the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their  feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in  general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not.  I become terrified and go home and say, \\\"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \\\" Then the crowd  runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and  starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors  are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is  shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it  turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and  kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop  them.  They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the  windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard,  and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't  crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey  Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear  tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous  din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were  shouting Father's name, \\\"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\\\" or something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma  says, \\\"Into the bedroom, quickly!\\\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part  of our dowry; Mamma says, \\\"Hide there, they probably won't come in there,  they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\\\" She says, \\\"We'll tell them  that we live alone here.\\\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in  the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say  that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I  can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak  Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told  her anything or not.  Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, \\\"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened.\\\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \\\"Get out of the apartment, leave.\\\" I  say, \\\"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the  apartment.\\\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, \\\"There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!\\\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts,  commanding them: \\\"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\\\"  And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start  undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there,  in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how  much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The  atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among  themselves who would go first.  Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding.  He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It  seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, \\\"Well, we're done here.\\\" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs  . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the  window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the  windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking  about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong  person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be,  which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they  don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I  humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing  . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.  I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't  know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by  my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings,  something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death  come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What  happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.   I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me  clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember  that I said the same words over and over again: \\\"Mamma, what happened, Mamma,  what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\\\" I can't make  sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all  went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his  courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though  he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he  served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor  brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,  \\\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\\\" How do I know who's who  and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when  they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda  said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going  to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's  hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our  sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding  on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in  there. So they survived.  My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back  up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed  there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put  it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and  knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \\\"I'm not going to let you  in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings  and we'll leave the building.\\\" Lyuda says, \\\"I'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\\\" It was just for a  moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came  back to our place and lay under the bed . . .  I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone  number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he  came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were  simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,  it was hard to breathe . . .  My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our  administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary  passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right  after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a  great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not  only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next,  without stopping. After us.  I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young  Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.  Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in  Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \\\"Run quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\\\" At that moment  three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,  there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything  out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to  scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you  here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of  the soldiers said, \\\"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the  Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\\\" So at that point the  Daghestan police were there.  When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously  injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they  were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda  and me and said, \\\"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't  know what to do with the rest.\\\"  So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My  boss said, \\\"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens.\\\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She  examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait  ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People  called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.  That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself,  \\\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\\\" She looks me over and  says, \\\"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things.\\\" And I think, great, I have to deal  with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this  condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't  have the energy to say, \\\"How could our people possibly be smart enough to  think of something that yours haven't already done?\\\" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her  own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next  morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything  more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,  nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at  them.  I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \\\"Better to ask  your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can  better explain what happened.\\\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw  themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward.  Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me  clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress,  but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up  above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \\\"I can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\\\" I went back to my  ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and  brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I  couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one  had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . .  Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should  be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an  Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must  have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something  else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.  The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,  and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many  troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw  a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought  that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait  after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't  come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.  I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm  me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw  a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each  other and asking, \\\"What happened, what went on?\\\" Two days later they came to  see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed  interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they  could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues  who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,  neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what  happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart  . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came,  not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part  of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I  lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be  from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of  insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful.  There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took  me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were  emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's  friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic.  They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasn't cut.  They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon  appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not  talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \\\"We  demand that Seidov come!\\\" The response was, \\\"It's Seidov who sent us.\\\" Seidov  is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said,  \\\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same  things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you  agitators.\\\" And so on. More of them said, \\\"Have Seidov himself come.\\\" This  went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us  out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because  they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The  smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who  had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a  club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay  to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day  someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie  theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it  was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants  took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in  Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to  mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting  right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only  the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women  were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come  any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered  together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie  theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to  the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and  couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently  they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my  eyes.  Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \\\"Aren't you an  Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\\\" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in  nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs.  So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't  spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered  the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only  the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself,  she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the  building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children.  This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were  already in the city.  They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire  families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't  see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult  now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify  the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard  that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people,  including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3.  They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who  had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were  going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply  savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did  what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that  hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from  the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the  ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and  she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and  beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that  whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and  carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.  I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of  people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a  song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has  that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,  the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They  couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face.  I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had  talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the  Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met  with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint  meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of  those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.  They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were  dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch  me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these  people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan.  The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was  there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't  recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, \\\"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\\\" He turned away  and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina  anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out  anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became  myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people  there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his  name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one  we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \\\"If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his  alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not  responsible for my words.\\\" He said, \\\"What did they do to you, how awful,  myself, I hid an Armenian family.\\\" Then after some time goes by he comes back  again and says something entirely different: \\\"I wasn't at home, my family and  I went to Baku.\\\" I said, \\\"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before.\\\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is  being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me  that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.  What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the  head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an  insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the  same time  I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I can't say.                                                       When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it,  because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it  always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my  face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed,  they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41,  is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ  dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our  building was killed, it was that man.  A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come  over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was  all over, people started making announcements in town saying that  investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now  they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he  himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy  came to the plant and said, \\\"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the  bus station on Saturday at ten.\\\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do  you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent,  probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go,  because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had  killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of  that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that  the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from  I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word  I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an  Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know.  His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from  Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time.  His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani  KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many  photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at  curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this,  the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a  haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he  is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did,  I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment.  At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,  all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, \\\"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like  you.\\\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything  without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when  she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had  all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.  They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that  moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the  faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the  apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and  no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have  anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the  apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the  apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they  know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the  building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis  lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our  apartment.  I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt  when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from  our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \\\"Karina, we  saw all of it, how could it happen?\\\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to  me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been  able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani  woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated  woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two  Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She  came down to the entryway and said, \\\"You'll come in this entryway over my dead body.\\\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some  folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't  even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They  couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani  stopped them.  They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place  they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the  apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that?  Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is  some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed  to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had  come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They  screamed and screamed: \\\"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\\\"  Only they didn't shout \\\"kill,\\\" they shouted \\\"gurun ermianlary.\\\" Gurun  literally means \\\"kill,\\\" or \\\"destroy.\\\"  That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their  kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part  of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . .  A boy said to my mother \\\"Where's the gold?\\\" Mamma said he must have been 12  to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the  Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the  fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where  the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a  little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to  wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were  bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and  Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth,  bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had  shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and  tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having  trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and  started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted  to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by  accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,  \\\"What's happened?\\\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \\\"At least go and  find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or  murdered them, at least bring the corpses.\\\" He went looking for us. At that  moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that  someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out  from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought  she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to  herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from  under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that  way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled  down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it happened in.  And Mamma said, \\\"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting  something or other, and running toward the other building.\\\" It had more or  less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I  tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \\\"Listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how  long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\\\" I don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe  not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \\\"Mamma, what do you need any of that  for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\\\" She says, \\\"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the  night at someone else's.\\\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were  coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He  shouts, \\\"Come back, they're coming!\\\" They didn't have enough time to get a  lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my  knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his  wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to  leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,  they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building,  maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished  building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more  or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.  Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there,  something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even  live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and  mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television.  They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \\\"My  God, what is going on around here? When will this end?\\\" We turned off the  lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who  knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but  they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that  he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his  apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up  at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, \\\"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us.\\\" He went upstairs, and they say, \\\"Aren't you taking anything from this  apartment?\\\" He says, \\\"I don't need anything.\\\" And the women who were standing  in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were  standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the  first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time  to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty  pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really  mad, and he says, \\\"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\\\" They tell him,  \\\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\\\" He ran off in that direction.  Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms,  there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They  just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man,  she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told  me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them,  the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \\\"Where's the girl who was here?\\\" And he became furious. The woman tells him, \\\"She came to . . . \\\" She didn't know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \\\"She came to and went to the basement.\\\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the  whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took  flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been  standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there  to get me. Then one of them said, \\\"There's so much water down there, she  probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in  the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\\\" I didn't know that, and  when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't  just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .  After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really  didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and  started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all.  Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people  who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think  that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but  they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole  brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\\\" That's  all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not  one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were  standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women  that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for  one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,  an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom:  if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed  to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \\\"If you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\\\" So she left. That trick didn't work on them.  Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget  that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,  then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister.  And no one did anything. Anything.

They were indeed 6.5 up with 12 to go, but they won their final two games after the horrid 10-loss streak.  The final game victory (Bunning's 19th win, if memory serves) kept the Reds from tying for the title; they and the Phils were both 1 game behind the Cards, with the Giants(?) another game back.  The Mets couldn't hold an early lead against the Cards that final Sunday, or there would have been a 3-way tie.  Too bad they couldn't have saved some of the 15 or so runs they scored on Saturday when they crushed St. Louis. --\",\"If anyone out there has an HP180 series scope or mainframe, I have the TDR plug in (the 1810, I believe) for it and have no need to keep it.

I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly  overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and  average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t  think I'm off by much.

The Clinton administration  nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever  in regulating cryptography. To do so is tantamount to regulating  `acceptable' speech, and is blatantly unconstitutional. Perhaps we  should rename this year `1984' in honor of such an illustrious  proposal.  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy, and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure.  I am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures.  The U.S. government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any serious threat to my liberties such as this, and I call on everyone with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this  proposal.  The administration does not seem to understand that they are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public, and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is  wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty.   It seems to me that U.S. Diplomatic communications should be  tappable by the U.N. whenever any countries produce a warrant to the U.N.  In fact, I think we should stop paying the NSA billions of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason. These actions violate the sovereignity of international law. (I hope Mr. Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here. But if he isn't, it's a modest and reasonable proposal, so he should find merit with it nevertheless.)  Cryptography is neutral technology. If everybody has strong  cryptography (including policemen, bureacrats, businessmen,  housewives, thugs and hoodlums), we have a sustainable  equilibrium.  Anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian  arrangement, intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms, and guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent  impracticality. We don't need to compromise on issues of freedom.   For too long our government has demonstrated itself to be  increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality  and protecting Americans.   It is not possible for the Federal Government to ``act quickly'' or develop ``consistent, comprehensive policies'' PERIOD.  And even if by some grandiose miracle such a thing were possible, it would only be an efficient way to deprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights.  The administration has to be committed to leaving private  industries alone, esp. on this issue.  The government has no  legitimate role in regulating the content of communications. Law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their surveillance bludgeon; they are soon and inevitably to be  disarmed of it.    No such laws can be constitutionally sound, and this is equivalent to a veiled threat, which I don't appreciate.  This kind of  extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism. I will trade threats for threats, and violation for violation.   If the administration did say this, it would find itself  impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential, established, entrenched, and explicit constitutional privacy  guarantees. The administration would have no legal standing  whatsoever; such an action would be egregiously illegal and criminal, and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast  segments of the population.   The U.S., comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically  committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an  increasingly totalitarian government, is saying just that.   Take your chips and give them to NSA employees as Christmas bonuses. We can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please,  and we will make any chips we please, and we will send any bit  pattern over our data highways we please. And if you try to stop  us, you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness.  [privacy vs. law enforcement]  This is an outright Dingaling Denning lie.  The two aims of privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally  incompatible, and you have to work for the NSA to think otherwise.  Americans are about to discover ways, through the use of technology,  to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly  been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and  *unrepresentative* government.  --\",\"      The Giants always hit Maddux well, but it was interesting that Maddux did not pitch around Bonds to get to Clayton last night.  He threw 2 straight fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the first one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd, when Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally walk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.       The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has not scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I'm concerning about his on-base percentage.  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams, he has to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base.         The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL.  Burba has done a superb job filling in so far, he looks like a different pitcher from last year.  However, Swift is terrible in both of his starts.  With Burba moving into the rotation, Mike Jackson is the only right-handed reliever aside from Rod Beck, he'll get a lot of actions.

After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were intermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining 5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.  Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems. Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I then insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the IIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me another RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see the drive there's a definite hardware problem.  Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send me a *new* one, but they said \\\"no.\\\" Also, within three weeks after I purchased my original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.  I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data recovery.)  It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new.   I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La Cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful. But c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent a letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even  have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)  What's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy any other products from La Cie in the future.  Bill Krauthammer f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu\",\" The New York talk shows are just awful in this regard.

I must also note that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian] prohibitions.  What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:   A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved      in the Inquisition.   B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however      painful this *seems*, \\\"discipline\\\" her children for their      own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or      if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example      \\\"deterring\\\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)   A.  I point out that this \\\"justification\\\" of a failure in love      depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of      philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.   B.  Burns me at the stake.  My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is going on here has a *lot* to do with \\\"cultural baggage.\\\"  In this case, the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B.  Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B, then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what- ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney.  So, \\\"one possibility\\\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in may others.  At the other extreme, the \\\"persuasion\\\" will succeed when it properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that many of the victims of Inquisition will have \\\"accepted\\\" that they were in fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them.)  The point is that the \\\"persuasion\\\" breaks down when the parties do NOT share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main thrust of the Inquisition, against \\\"heresy\\\", it is *bound* to break down in precisely the \\\"worst\\\" cases.  The \\\"conservative\\\" (I don't think that is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above, that he is \\\"justified\\\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to a \\\"greater good.\\\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow the gospel, as if one's theories about \\\"sin\\\" entitled one to cast aside Jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).  I am a \\\"radical\\\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.   Well, the whole *point* of making these the \\\"base\\\" commandments is that they *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \\\"Conservatives\\\" may twist this \\\"act as if you were God\\\" to mean \\\"lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.\\\" They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \\\"against God\\\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \\\"conservatives\\\" have confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.   And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged *different* \\\"ethical systems\\\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result, it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular (or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH. It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very little, if anything, in the way of \\\"commandments\\\" -- so little that the \\\"Christians\\\" who desperately *want* commandments go \\\"mining\\\" for them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-)) for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus specifically \\\"gives\\\" as \\\"a commandment\\\" to us is \\\"love one another.\\\"   [I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson   that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that   SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll   point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why   there is a huge amount of \\\"cultural baggage\\\" involved.]  You are quite right that this is \\\"goo\\\" if one is looking for an ethical system.  But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.   I think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity? [Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]\",\"Probably within 50 years, a new type of eugenics will be possible.

At the most basic level, you should know that there is a big difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding \\\"quotations\\\" that support your preset opinions.  If you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that many of the sources of your \\\"quotations\\\" have an axe to grind, and therefore you must be very careful about whom you \\\"quote.\\\"  For example, Meir Pa'il, whom you cite, was indeed a general, a scholar, and a war hero.  But that doesn't mean everything that comes out of his mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience shows), Pa'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his anti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be considered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of course you don't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy \\\"quotation\\\" that you can use to attack Israel.  Benny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a \\\"scholar\\\" when he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don't be fooled. It's just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an attack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at the section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence, you will see his \\\"indictment\\\" to be pure hot air.  And this is the BEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning evidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as \\\"scholarly,\\\" he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see that his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing.  The Deir Yassin \\\"massacre\\\" never took place as the propagandists tell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila \\\"massacres.\\\" Do you get the feeling people like to blame the Jews for \\\"massacres,\\\" even if they have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews like to do it, for reasons of their own.  Please, don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin \\\"massacre\\\" stuff with facts or scholarship.  You should stick to Begin's version unless you find something serious to contradict it.\",\"Is life a pass/fail course, and does God grade on a curve?  I'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to know what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an infinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that he/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?) Also, are we \\\"graded\\\" by those around us, or has there always been some unchanging method?  Is the person's childhood taken into account?  I'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you, but I figure that you're the experts.        -Quinn  [Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect that's because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However both Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of similar passages where Jesus says things like \\\"even XXX will be better off than you in the judgement.\\\"  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens, so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the Mormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition to the Bible and \\\"Holy Tradition\\\" of a more generic Christian sort.  Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free us from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you like test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale, but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading. Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to see why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are differences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all agree that in one way or another, God cheats.  I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't explicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their hearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in principle, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing line.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not.\",\"Does anyone know where I can still get an internal fax modem for the  original mac portable?

They were persecuted, and in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies were considered not pure Gypsies but \\\"mongrels\\\" formed from the pure Gypsy  race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between  the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies, by the way.

Another naive illusion down the toilet....      ----- Tommy McGuire mcguire@cs.utexas.edu mcguire@austin.ibm.com\",\"        Hmmm... people in the americas before the time of Christ, children who die young, etc. ?        But of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.       I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond  bodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe they're going to hell. They believe they're going to _die_. Understand that you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows that all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you want to say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven, but this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (die a final death))     I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_ sort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that there will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence.  (assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'll never know I'm dead. Hmmm...         Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Heaven now.\\\" ?      Consider the following statement:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Hell now.\\\"      The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell,  it would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering.  Granted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any conscious experience whatsoever).       You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning  to a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort  of eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this eternity.       Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda (\\\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\\\" It's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife. Can anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all animals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of super-survival.          That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and  an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King, I might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_ by Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven.  \\\"Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?\\\" asked an Eskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something to the effect of, \\\"Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting?

Many Russians became disillusioned with democracy and reforms when they felt, rightly IMO, that the West didn't care.  Yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid (once Bush got over his Gorby-mania.)  This probably kept him from dismantling the congress and calling for new elections.  Well, the aid didn't come through and we didn't make sure it went to the proper places and now the anti-reformers are gaining strength where before they were in hiding.   If they don't reform I don't believe in giving them money.  However, I think this is too important to take a non-interventionist approach. This is what really bugs me about Libertarianism -- it sounds like 'it'll all be the same in a hundred years time.  no need to do anything.'  Despite the wishes of Libertarians, this society is a far way, and getting farther, from being Libertarian.  Perhaps voluntary gifts would work if we had the proper framework but we do not have it.  We have to face the problem *now*, not in X years when we have a Libertarian dream society.  Right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade, let alone charity. There are still limitations to high-tech exports.  NASA can't buy Proton launch vehicles from them.  Sure, the market may be able to help a great deal but it can't right now.  There are too many obstacles. Instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to  tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face.  Well, I think limited government is primarily democratic due to it being limited.  But the main question is how do you transform a state-run economy and monolithic government into something that even remotely looks like ours?  (BTW, sometimes it seems that our government  is trying to go the opposite direction)  It is not going to be painless and not going to be easy.  We simply cannot wait to help when they *have* the 'proper' government.  They'll never get there without the aid.  It may be too late already.   And I'm just excercising mine.   As I also said above, another problem I have is with *transformation*. A Libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight. I have seen nothing about how to take our current government and society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible self-sufficient populace.

You may as well know that all this stuff about the secret source of the Clipper announcement is because of a silly mistake.  I am the administrator of csrc.ncsl.nist.gov, alias first.org.  It's a system set up to help out the needs of FIRST, a Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, which  includes a number of world-wide incident response teams such as CERT/CC and other places in Europe.  As to the VRFY and EXPN commands, they are normally disabled, since early on we didn't want crackers to find out the names of incident response folks on our mailing lists.  We had a disk crash several months ago which required completely rebuilding the O/S files - same old story, our backups weren't especially helpful.  As you can guess, I didn't remember to re-disable VRFY and EXPN until I saw people on the net trying to find out who was behind clipper@csrc...  When I saw people's names posted here, I felt it was time to clear things up.  So, EXPN and VRFY on csrc have always been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with  Clipper.  I posted the White House announcements at the request of policy folks here because csrc also provides Usenet service.  I posted them from an account called 'clipper.'  I also created an alias called 'clipper' that contains the addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and Advisory Board, set up under law of the Computer Security Act of 1987, and addresses of other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography, security, and privacy - I believe that these individuals were included on this list because NIST felt it important to get them the Clipper information first-hand.  The 'clipper' alias is there for the benefit of those named above.  It is  not a source for information, it was set up solely to monitor any initial traffic.  Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get traffic that is not already duplicated on Usenet.  While you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this, I would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives of the individuals on the 'clipper' alias - I've already apologized to them for what's happened.

What I see as arrogance and the problem I have  with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just  Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.    Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal  sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these  matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them  but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus  anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that leads to arrogance.  In my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)    comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\",\"Hi there, I can't seem to get mail to you.

How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the person claiming to be IT is obviously insane?  I'm not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ.  How could somebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming?  Koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast.  He didn't.  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people.  And, from my meagre knowledge of the Bible, it seems that Christians have been hard on the Jews of Christ's day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the Messiah.  So I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the Second Coming while, at the same time, not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God.  [Mark 13:21   And then if any one says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!'  or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.  Mark 13:22   False Christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and  wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect.  Mark 13:23   But take heed; I have told you all things beforehand.  Mark 13:24    \\\"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be  darkened, and the moon will not give its light,  Mark 13:25   and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in  the heavens will be shaken.  Mark 13:26   And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with  great power and glory.   My understanding of Jesus' answer is that, unlike his first coming, which was veiled, the second coming will be quite unmistakeable.  He's telling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen before his second coming -- the actual second coming will make his power openly visible.  By the way, from Koresh's public statement it's not so clear to me that he is claiming to be Christ.\",\"    I've been told that Panasonic has uploaded some to Compu$erve, but I don't have a CIS account.

In between '91 and '92, the instrument pannel  of the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been reset to zero.

I'm not sure why you don't consider it an option.

Libertarians would do well to learn more about it.    Sorry, but it strikes me that it is the only \\\"feasible\\\" approach.  What is not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and  licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent tasks.   Actually, the only areas of public spending above that strike me as  generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense. (It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to be to a principle of non-coercion, the only areas of public spending that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns....hmmm...)   Perhaps you have.  May I suggest that you consider that revolutionaries frequently generate support by acting as protectors of \\\"geezers,\\\"  mothers and children.

Between 1914 and 1920, Armenians  committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of  despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned  them, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound  hand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated  personal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most  unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history.                                  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  \\\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\\\" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. \\\"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.\\\"  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  \\\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  \\\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  \\\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\\\" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \\\"We have never got any of the bodies back.\\\"  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  \\\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\\\" Mr Sadikov said. \\\"I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.\\\"  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left). Nurses struggle in primitive conditions  (centre)  to  save  a  wounded  man  in  a  makeshift operating  theatre set  up  in a  train carriage.

Dave Winfield has had a better career than half the people in the Hall of Fame.  Eddie Murray and Darrel Evans are both one of the top 100 players of all time.  Lee Smith has had probably the greatest long career of any relief pitcher since 1960, with the possible exception of Gossage.  On the other hand, Kingman probably isn't one of the best 750 players of all time.  And Reardon, though a good pitcher, isn't in Smith's class career wise.    We're talking 2 of the top 50 players of all time here.  There probably aren't 5 shortstops in history who were better than these two.   Garvey sucked.  Morris, while a very good pitcher, simply doesn't belong near Cooperstown.   Gee, can these guys even compare to  If Puckett and Ryan (okay, no if there) get into to the Hall, they will be  marginal Hall of Famers (unless Puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for a while longer)  To put this in perspective, here's a listing of the linear weights values of the careers of the players you mention.  In parenthesis is how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it. While no one would claim these are perfect rankings, they should give you a good value of these guys' careers as compared to average players.  Robin Yount 43.0 (41) Ozzie Smith 42.1 (45) Dave Winfield 40.3 (53) Eddie Murray 37.5 (68) Darrel Evans 35.2 (80) Kirby Puckett 24.3 (180) Nolan Ryan 21.6 (219) Jack Morris 11.8 (478) Dave Kingman 0.4  Steve Garvey -5.8  To give you an idea of how these numbers compare to those in the Hall: Of the 71 eligible players whose career stats equaled 35.0, 64 are in the Hall of Fame. The ones who aren't include 4 19th century players, Ron Santo, Bobby Grich, and Bob Johnson.  Of those eligible who score between 30.0 and 34.9, 15 of 25 are in.  Of those eligible who score between 25.0 and 29.9, 24 of 44 are in. \",\"Who the hell is this guy David Davidian. I think he talks too much..   Yo , DAVID you would better shut the f... up.. O.K ??

I don't believe that physical knowledge has a great deal of impact on the power of God.  In the past, God gave us the ability to create life through sexual relations.  Now, he is giving us the ability to create life through in vitro fertilization.  The difference between the two is merely  cosmetic, and even if we gain the ability to create universes we won't begin to approach the glory of God.   The power we are being given is a test, and I am sure that in many cases we will use our new abilities unwisely.  But, people have been using sexuality unwisely for millenia and I haven't heard an outcry to abolish it yet!   No matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world, we aren't impinging on God's power.  It's only when we attempt to gain control of the spiritual world, those things that can't be approached through science and  logic, that we begin to interfere with God.\",\"Time once again to clean out the ol' closet.

A reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time dithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational  equipment to \\\"back out\\\" the errors in its position (since it knows where it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a  broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit.  The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will use existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately 305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals on different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system which has stations all across the US.  The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format. Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- John P. Baker                   | My opinions are my own.

I will argue that your latter statement, \\\"I believe that no gods exist\\\" does rest upon faith - that is, if you are making a POSITIVE statement  that \\\"no gods exist\\\" (strong atheism) rather than merely saying I don't   know and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then (weak atheism). Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying   I BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even  after reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.  But first let me say the following. We might have a language problem here - in regards to \\\"faith\\\" and \\\"existence\\\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist. To exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE being - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it's rather pointless to debate the so called \\\"existence\\\" of God - and that is not what I'm doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of being. When you say that \\\"god does not exist\\\", I also accept this statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However, in what follows I will use the phrase \\\"the existence of God\\\" in it's 'usual sense' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it. I would like a clarification upon what you mean by \\\"the existence of God\\\".   We also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what  faith  1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY b  (1): fidelity to one's promises    (2): sincerity of intentions 2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God    (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    (2): complete trust 3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF    One can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say that you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion \\\"based upon observation\\\", I will have to ask \\\"what observtions are you refering to?\\\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even be predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes  partents \\\"believe in God\\\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion about the \\\"existence\\\" or \\\"non-existence\\\" of God requires a leap - and you have made this leap when you actively say \\\"I believe that God   does/does not exist\\\". Personally, I think that both statements are misguided. Arguing over the \\\"existence\\\" of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him (and yes, I use \\\"Him\\\" because a personal God is the only  viable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \\\"She\\\" go ahead. Of course  God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to  anthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I'll be  glad to.)     And please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently  disagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person  thinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think  I have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my  ways and I correct the situation. I'm interested in a polite and well   thought out discussion.         \",\"Here is a different viewpoint.   In practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed  with inkjet because smudges etc. can happen.   A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of  that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than  you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the  printer. (I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the  printer)  A sage said to me: \\\"Do you want one copy or lots of copies?\\\", \\\"One\\\",  \\\"Inkjet\\\".    Paper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter  will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that  are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.  HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the  software package has no inkjet driver.   There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a  page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a  laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers  actually use this facility.

I admit that they are vague, but they can still be distinguished clearly, especially if the environment (i.e. the rest of the room) is a bit dark. Applications which produce this effect are: - the previewer of DirectTeX 1.2 (i.e. DVIReader 1.2) - Kaleidagraph 2.1.1/FPU  The machines use their built-in video and drive the old  Apple Hires Monochrome screen (two monitors/cable sets tried).   The effect is independent of the settings in the following control  panels: Memory (adressing mode, disk cache)          and Monitors (nr of greys/colors).  Have you ever seen this effect too ?   Is there a solution ?

PST                     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING  on the aid package.        SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The  President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed  yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic  and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.          Before taking your questions and running through the  basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.   First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do  with available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds  have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is  no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund  any of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently  are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin  tomorrow.              The second point is that this package is designed to  support Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package  are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have  been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian  government.              Third, the President is determined that we will  deliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed  to maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we  wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we  feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in  front of you.              Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of  trade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's  capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend  well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of  governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do  so.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make  trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.                They also agreed that there would be a new joint  commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by  Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through  the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote  a vastly expanded relationship.              If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down  the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just  give you some general background on what these programs are.   I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.              The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food  and medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has  been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian  grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure  there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the  major cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food  for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also  be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and  pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.              The second item is concessional food sales.  As you  know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship  with Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia  that we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the  Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.   The value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are  concessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out,  but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on  principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates  thereafter for the life of the deal.              The third program is a collection of private sector  support.  We think this is one of the most important things we're  going to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses  is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.   And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American  enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the  goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in  Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.                The President has also decided to create a  privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian  government in its priority objective of trying to convert state  enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has  also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a  Eurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by  prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.              The fourth grouping you see there in the summary  page is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that  this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of  pursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total  of $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed  tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're  launching.                The President is also calling for the development of  a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to  try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public  efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in  Russia.              The fifth program you see is Russian office of  resettlement.  This is a new initiative created and  conceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration  project.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military  to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic  states and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to  make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's  with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American  construction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration  basis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working  very closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say  that we have a long-term commitment to this project.                The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They  are two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our  initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the  possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and  gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in  the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much  environmental damage.              I've talked a little bit about trade and investment,  about the new group being created that the Vice President will  chair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing  with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development  committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy,  to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede  trade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time  investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this  problem full-time.                And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and  investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an  analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we  just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a  commitment within our own government to have people work on it --  senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly  important.              You'll notice that the United States is going to  support Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer  status.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested  our advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the  long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is  paramount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are  supporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting  their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.                You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in  credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended  $150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil  project.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an  agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion  framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance  Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services.  We think this is a very important development.  We think we'll  get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo  conference, the G-7 conference.              Before I take any further questions, I'd like to  defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance  objectives with you.              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major  unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts  in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and  secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory  under the terms of the START I and START II agreements.    Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important  agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding  to three important programs.  The first is the program of $130  million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement  program.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for  bomber dismantlement -- $130 million.              The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for  the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed  from the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially  contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the  construction of that storage facility.                And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help  in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear  materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we  add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance  which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall  safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety  measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the  last couple of years.                So this is an area where we will be going a lot more  work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks,  and Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last  couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for  safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian  territory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of  START I, an agreement to accede to NPT.               So we are working very hard with all the parties to  the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with  them.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia  as a very important step in that process.              Q   The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in  Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with  Kazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the  same one, why do you feel it's necessary?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same  deal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil  field.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights  oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced  today.  So it's completely new.              Q   Can you tell us more about what's involved?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like  other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do  two things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west  Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating  oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.   The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the  natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which  will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what  Russia needs.              So we think this deal is very, very good development  for Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an  American company.  And the American government has played a  leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility  in OPIC and through the loan guarantee.              Q   So it's to search and also to renovate fields  that are already there?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.              Q   On that point, should other American companies  expect to get administration support for such deals, or should  they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2  billion?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know,  Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the  U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department  and the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we  think it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th,  there will be $2 billion in financing available for American  companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.              Q   That should take up all of the rest of the  deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be  support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a  tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas  companies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and  gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will  soak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may  even extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.              Q   What's the current year budget costs of that  $2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any  current year budget costs --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer  you to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.              Q   The concessional food sales -- is there any  current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in  which the payments are due?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional  food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.   USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to  expend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd  refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.              Q   Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?              Q      and the private sector -- how many folks are  going to be involved in that?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start  with the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt  coming into office that there were literally thousands of  organization, private organizations in the United States that in  one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve  democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.   And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that  had a variety of programs in this area.  And so the  administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try  to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give  some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the  efforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.              It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will  soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in  the former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might  use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of  our own government, but the resources of the American private  sector and schools and communities across the nation.              Q      any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word  yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated  besides the $300 million the President talked about?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration  is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What  the President has done this weekend is to consult really  intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional  measures the United States could take in some of these areas to  support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he  returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other  ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.              Q   Two questions about the $700 billion  agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of  consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.   So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you  explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans  for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit  into that situation?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the  United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains  and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think  between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history  here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through  the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle  to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of  last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on  that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and  therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that  program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and  other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we  could promote American grain sales.                And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've  announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the  Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient  authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked  for a concessional loan program.                I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a  short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but  a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what  this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are  worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of  principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the  life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of  interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we  believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal  for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments  and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this  very important grain relationship, which is important for them,  and it's important for the American farm community.              Q   I gather from what you say that this could make  it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC  loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through,  is that right?               SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit  about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing   the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program  because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you  know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around  $640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having  taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American  market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to  respond to a specific request from the Russian government for  major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the  grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there,  we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to  great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with  the Russian government and arrived at this solution.                I think the Russians are pleased because it provides  them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on  the short-term payments.              Q   Where do those funds actually come from?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the  Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's  authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do  not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want  to make that general point again:  Everything in this package,  the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been  allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration  can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very  important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year,  that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be  able to do so.              Q   How did you arrive at the figure of $700  million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually  have a range from 0 to --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason  for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us  that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and  harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the  shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the  harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the  same level of food imports from the West.              Q   I would imagine there's going to be some  considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other  republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.   Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for  the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with  some of the other republics?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very  conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending  American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet  Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the  area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that  you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and  roughly 50 percent to the other countries.               In the area of food sales, we have been active with  Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We  will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this  summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the  other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are  productive and they're hard-hitting.              Q   Has anything happened at the summit to lead  American energy companies and other companies to believe that  Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of  taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our  primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not  only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd  like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're  convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to  support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of  Western governments have the financial resources over the next  decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private  sector can do that.                We look at our own society and we see tremendous  capability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very  good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial  investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new  technology and new capital to finance new production.                That's what the Russian government has told us it  wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis  on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on  the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently  last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President  Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong  signal to the American business community that we support their  efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex- Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to  support them.              Q   My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to  deliver on making Russia a more --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I  would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr.  Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas  sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice  President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the  barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil  and gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that  committee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to  the work.              Q   What type of mechanism is already in place to  administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will  the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of  the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the  Russian government for distribution at their will?                   SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking  about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the  program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working  through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure  that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to  the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the  Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can  account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of  months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of  these programs.              But they are all quite different.  For instance, in  the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it  is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of  the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working  through Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the  housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers,  we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the  democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian  private individuals and private foundations.  We're working with  journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have  noticed.              So we literally have here 30 to 40 different  activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be  carried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the  Russian government, some with Russian citizens.              Q   The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and  on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the  President has to do on that?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George  noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in  the relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's  fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we  return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and  we'll get back to the Russian government.              Q   You were not prepared for these questions when  you got here?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared  for these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not  prepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require -- let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require  consultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with  the American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those  concerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before  we take any action.              Q   Is this package designed so that you will not  have to go to Congress for anything at this point?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the  beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all  the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.   So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to  seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In  effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the  agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And  that's the advantage of this particular initiative.              Q   If this, as the President says, is a long-term,  long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment  heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to  Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are  prepared to go to Congress for various things?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been  clear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with  President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American  funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a  major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by  Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that  delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.   And we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where  it stands now.              Q   We've been told repeatedly that a number of  these items represent different or new ways of spending the money  already appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these  items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways  that it was not previously set to be?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've  said that these are all projects that either Congress had  allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were  some funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this  administration took office and had some new ideas about how the  funds might be expended.              We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or  the FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations -- Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to  further our programs.              And example of that is the Food for Progress  concessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of  funding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we  looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American  market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we  found it.              Q   Where, for example, are you getting the money  for this Russian officer resettlement --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the  Freedom Support Act funds.              Q   In other words, all of the money is being  directly spent in new ways, so to speak --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant  projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the  second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if  you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that  total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act  funding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year  '92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the  legislative history of those funds.              Q      cooperation --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I  don't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.              Q   Could you tell us please, has anything happened  here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and  Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's  happened here --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents,  President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this  issue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security  and arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's  session.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly  reinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been  talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple  of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the  discussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very  important negotiation that's been going on essentially between  Moscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially  discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute  to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.                But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend,  I don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.              Q?     Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is  any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current  year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been  earmarked and put it into this fund?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and  mirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We  could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included  out-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to  many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the  privatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already  talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.                We could have put in really big numbers and this  could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:   This package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're  going to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President  feels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy  that the western governments, the combination of governments, put  up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not  able to meet them, we're determined, and the President is  determined, to carry out every single program in this package.   And we'll do it.                But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's  part of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking  for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively  support reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment  on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.              Q      taken it way from any --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.   Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds;  so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in  Russia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.              Q   In terms of funding, there is no available  monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money  somewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I  don't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the  example is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit  guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay  back within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt  problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we  looked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement  for grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and  also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers  have a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply  look for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative  authority to do it.  This program has been successful in other  areas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union,  but we thought we should now.                 Q   Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package  for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by  initiatives put forward by President Bush?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think  that's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were  appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This  administration took office and inherited some obligations that  the Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven  week review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments  that had been made by the previous administration.                But we have gone well beyond them in funding the  enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not  been filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to  it.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them  into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say,  is another Clinton initiative.                Further, we listened to the Russian government and  listened to the Russian military who told us that the  resettlement of their officers was important to them for  political and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton  has responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment  that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out  a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.                I would also say that the President has given  impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly  about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we  have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends  itself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the  creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative,  we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private  sector as well as the American government, to achieve that  objective.                So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And  as most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the  last administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last  administration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton  assistance package for Russia.              Q   There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the  past has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this  outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money  will not just disappear because it's being administered by the  Russian government?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I  know that the President and other senior officials of our  government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and  that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's  intended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the  State Department will take great care in making sure that the  funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their  source.              I would not that this package is not simply a  package of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of  these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are  going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals,  with businesses.  The private enterprise support is another  example of that.              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add  a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one  area that we've been looking at very, very closely is  consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting  for these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely,  of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime  contractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of  a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that  funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in  Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent  efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.              Q   When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly  when do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President  is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think  it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over  the next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties  on May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over  the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach  out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us  to help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said  that we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate  in a much more effective way the activities of our own  government.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in  Russia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw  them together and to focus their efforts.              Q   Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will  actually be spent in the United States by American made goods?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any  figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something  up in the next couple of days on that.              Q   This figure is larger than the figure that has  been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result  of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think -- unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and  I'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put  us to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was  briefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the  intellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of  the ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we  had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have  been refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week  going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in  Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.   And so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been  together for about two weeks.              Q   Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There  was so much talk before about the President wanted to get  Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.   Is that in the out years?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.   President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance,  that support for the creation of private businesses is important  to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is  important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize  the state industries is important to them.                And so what we did was to try to make those the  centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We  listened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been  working with the Russian government for months on this trying to  work out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of  these programs was involved every step of the way.                But let me get at the other part of your question.   The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader  set of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking  for his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the  table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in  housing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to  consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other  allied governments that are also active.              Q   There's essentially nothing that happened in  the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that  you came in with?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular  package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks  ago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on  the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've  primarily talked about future, about what more the United States  and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia,  which is our base objective here.              Q   I noticed that you -- that money appropriated  to train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me  what about job training for workers who are displaced by  privatization?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we  have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and  financial services in the United States.  Part of the housing  initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain  Russian officers who are retiring into other professions.              Q      money for job training for workers whose  jobs are disappearing because of privatization --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet  allocated any money for that.              Q   Why not?              Q      of the $6 million is going to build 450  housing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the  Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do  housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework  of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've  got to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think  about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also  retraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming  out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.   We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers  as well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian  government.              Q      of the $6 million will go to retrain --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.              Q   Are you talking about apartment buildings or  single --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about  single, individual dwellings.              Q   You're saying that only 450 families will be  served by this?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I  thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.   What we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the  Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building  housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with  a huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next  couple of months and try to figure out with American  organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job  done.                I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.   And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into  this in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to  spend the money wisely.              Q   What is it about this program that convinces  you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be  in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back,  especially considering their other debt problem?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think  it's important to note that the United States on its own does not  have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.   It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to  our allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what  the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We  can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do  so, which is consistent with our national interests.              Q   Did the President say that the value of the  U.S. contribution was that it would create security and  prosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this  program that does this?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to  go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia,  and that is we want to do everything we can to support the  continuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay  in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear  forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction,  which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in  Russia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that  this program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we  have to make a long-term commitment to it.              Q   And then on the question of Russia's ability to  repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15  years from now?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian  government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping  is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve  their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency  revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years  from now to pay back those loans.              Q      substantial government-to-government loan  we've ever gotten into with the Russians?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to  answer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years  on this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because  the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to  just ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of  effort.              Q      government loans in any other sector that  you recall?  I know it wasn't done in --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair  to say this is a new and unique effort.\",\"Hey!

I talked of how great I felt that God had made such a pretty day, and how nice it was to give to people - she then said she was getting married soon. She talked about how she and her husband had very little (they may not have even had a house, for all I know), but that they felt a very special love in the Lord, an unselfish kind of caring.

We wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway.  You also need a tcp/ip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that's what they require to get the smtp gateway to work.  You need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff.  We do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do.    There is a glitch somewhere in the system though.  I don't know if it is MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to a Unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mail is routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail. Most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha. Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying \\\"Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)\\\".  If you can stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.  The system people of course say that the VAX is not the problem, the gateway is probably the problem.  If anyone wants to get help it is only $175.00 for one support call. (until problem is worked out)  Phooey to that I say.  I am looking vigorously for a better Idea.    If you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew,  please drop me a note - anyone.  The next itteration is supposed to have tcp/ip built in THEY say........

He did not tell me HOW I could change it using ResEdit, and I have lost his e-mail address.  Could he or any one else please tell me what to do?  I assume that the relevant resource is zSet, but I do not know, and I have no template for that resource. If you have a TMPL for the correct resource, I would be grateful to receive it. That way, I could play around a bit and maybe get my Duo to do something useful with its serial port. (other than Appletalk).  BTW, I believe that when the port stats says that maximum in buffer is 3074 bytes, that that means increasing the buffer will help, if you are using hardware handshaking. I can cram text data pretty fast into my Duo, and can monitor that CTS is being lowered, but the buffer never gets beyond 3074 (out of 4096) bytes. Makes sense to me.\",\"   And have Jesse Jackson picket the stadium?\",\" I hope there are some silicon jocks on the committee who can follow the algorithm through to hardware.

It would not    be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be    local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill    AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.    High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but    the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun    - and would pay through the nose for it.  Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude, homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of killing German soldiers for their guns.  Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible. The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel tubing, hand tools and a welder.  I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown locally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I think the demand for \\\"real\\\" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have firearms, and \\\"bad guys\\\" will continue to have access to them, one way or another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation.\",\"   Well, you can accomplish both goals, actually, if you have a definite physical type in mind when you go to these (cough) church meetings..

Thanks\",\"I've been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington,  I think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of  etymology.  I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my  childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes.   I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very  angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It  carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some  time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and  `Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To  become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would  consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared  to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a  better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable  riches of knowing Christ.  As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that  they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time  they had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They  didn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.   For example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.    When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her  death, she said to me, \\\"As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew.\\\"  What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a  Jew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with  matzoh balls.:-))   I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My  sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who  do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people  Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.  This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their  experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while  following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.    I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.   It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have  a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small  sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it  and do not want to ask for it back.  And while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.   I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the  Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is  that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again,  being rooted in the past.   This is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess  around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of  Easter).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.  I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all  believers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish  Christian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. \",\"Press Release No.19-93 Paris, 22 April 1993  Users of ESA's Olympus satellite report on the outcome of their experiments  \\\"Today Europe's space telecommunications sector would not be blossoming as it now does, had OLYMPUS not provided a testbed for the technologies and services of the 1990s\\\". This summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300 participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in Seville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).  OLYMPUS has been particularly useful : -      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of        new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small        antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested        data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,        distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few        examples.  -      in opening the door to new telecommunications services        which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-        frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over        Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.  -      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS        received for the first time in Europe, over several months,        high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and        then distributed it to various centres in Europe.  When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the world's largest telecommunications satellite; and no other satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.  OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some of the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite is given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or services; over the past four years some 200 companies and organisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over 100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning organisation.    As the new technologies and services tested by these OLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then make use of operational satellites such as those of EUTELSAT.\",\": > : >Well, at least I damaged my own bike.

About 20 years ago, _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips  in them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called \\\"Son o' God\\\" comics.  It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic, there were a  group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn, and when one of them said  the magic word, he turned into \\\"Son o' God.\\\" He went from a myopic,  curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied  portraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile  features.    Now, if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus,  and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this  NatLamp Jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since  this Jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.   This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim  that they are Christian. They profess faith in Jesus, but the Jesus  that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the  NatLamp Jesus was. \",\" : Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature  5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.  Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.  Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).  In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something.  Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature,  but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.    If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives, stick to the 10W40.  \",\" That's open for debate.

LOGICAL PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST'S RESURRECTION              1.  Jesus's enemies *would not* have stolen His                 body because that would have perpetrated the                 resurrection--the very opposite of what they                 desired.              2.  Jesus' disciples *could not* have stolen His                 body because Pontius Pilate established guards                 to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be                 stolen.              3.

Rod\",\"      Of course, nothing prevents you from buying a new lock with cash and installing it yourself. Even modifying the core to match some arbitrary key is not difficult to do at home. I once knew someone who had fixed his locks in this way - his house, office and cars all took the same key (which he took GOOD care of :-)        Very bad (yours, that is). Have you ever had a safety deposit box? They work on a two-key system. The bank clerk has one, and you have the other (they are different keys). The bank does NOT keep a copy of your key. If you lose it, they have to drill out the lock, and replace the door. This is a time consuming and expensive process (which they will be happy to charge to your account :-).       This process is exactly analogous to having a private key which is NOT in a escrow system, and the state having to crack your cipher to get the data.

John Atherton       \",\" OK, I've asked this before, and with a new thread on these lines, I ask this again:  1: If a large hole current is run thru a resistor, will there be    I^2 * R cooling instead of heating?  2: Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies    hole currents over normal electron currents?  3: what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of    hole mobility to electron mobility? (please quote actual    test samples rather than estimates based on theory. Also,    don't be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,    resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,    magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).  NOTES:     to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only area    where holes are not detectable is the vacuum. That is, hole    particles only exist in the presence of matter.    Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain    semi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is if    the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point    where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).    I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether    holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask for    an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such    currents *if* they exist.

(Probably the wrong newsgroup .... as everyone  claims..)  Anyway..  1) Does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a Trident 8900 SVGA graphics card (1MB) or even what the dip switches do on the end.. Mine already works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor I found  out which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility..   But I'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly little use..  2) Secondly, does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design of the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. (IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K) ??  3) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit ) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed... (Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I'm lazy 8)  4) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM on a PC (from a program written in Turbo C++)....   For instance, using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available from the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc... What I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the 1MB boundary...  I'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but I'll  suspect not ..   5) Also.. what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be re-entrant??????

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages.

The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be depressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just about (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working correctly is totally drop safe.  Now, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single documented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because he failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely prevented the office from getting shot.  The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire. This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down intentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a 'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else. By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece. From the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of firing it.  The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be familiar with that particular type of firearm.\",\"posting for a friend 1982 porsche 928 new this vehicle was $74,000 today book list this vehicle between 11,500 to 15,000 perfect in every way with all options including new paint, leather interior, sunroof and low miles call (408) 264-4444 ask for frank and lets negotiate trades considered \",\"1.

Not only does this mean that these people are  willing to give up everyone (else's) rights, they don't even know what  the Bill of Rights actually says.

What the previous GM also did was to trade  away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most notably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with Philly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will  necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a  great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly to the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by  injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered).  Put Scotty Bowman, Pat Burns, or any of the other better coaches in the  league behind the bench of this Detroit team, and they could beat anybody.\",\"I am looking out for an inexpensive fax modem card for PC.

I think we'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is no \\\"option\\\" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs: there is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full '040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA). And there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other than the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one of the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be getting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't be able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040. It's not an \\\"option.\\\"     Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s thinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot recognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for a FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or something like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to replace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the full '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.\",\"I posted this a while ago and didn't recieve one reply, and now we have another bug report on the same subject.

OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,     and distribution.  Digital immortality.  The basic idea behind \\\"digital immortality\\\" is that computer networks    are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be there...and someone will dig them up.     If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is  breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.   Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption... that's what they're here for.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  WHERE?               OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.       141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site     sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite   (you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)  Merely \\\"anonymous FTP\\\" to either site on Internet and change to the appropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the \\\"bin\\\" command to make sure you're in binary.  OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North America....the following systems have a substancial supply of OTIStuff...  Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines  CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron  --------------------------------------------------------------   HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?                What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely    photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me (email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received, it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works are also welcome.  OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.   GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to  see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,   you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change     JPG files to a standard GIF format.   OTIS also accepts animation files.        When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You  can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of  emailing).  If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send copies to:  The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha, NE 68124-1113  I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.   Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named, include those as well.     Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please contact me and we'll arrange things.  If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\\\" disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back. This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP, but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or JPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather not have to.  At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to  get a slab-o-OTIS.  As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.   Email me for current archive size and directory.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTION?  The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the appropriate text files along with the images.     It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.  It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite BBS system....or even just post this \\\"info-file\\\" there.  It would be keen of you.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  USE?  If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory, you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or full address credit).  You will either find this in the \\\".rm\\\" file for     the image or series of images...or in the \\\"Artists\\\" directory under the  Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have  to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for  you, or give you their contact information.   When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  NAMING IMAGES?  Please keep the names of your files in \\\"dos\\\" format.  That means, keep the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or four digit \\\"code\\\" for the series of images, plus the series number. Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something like:    ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC  Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------   CREATING IMAGE FILES?  When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in case they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title, address or other information you'd like people to know.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  HMMM?!  That's about it for now.  More \\\"guidelines\\\" will be added as needed. Your input is expected.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS          (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,       or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations       however.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original         image files.  The files will go to the public at large.         It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone       could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.             Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS       takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights       revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to        give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed        electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed            all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is       NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or       broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not        limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,               screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific       permission for this sort of usage.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Remember, the operative term is \\\"stimulate\\\".

Wait a minute. S&K did NOT compare trends.  If they did, they would have seen that the advent of Canada's gun law had no effect on homicides, total or handgun.  Without a pre- vs. post comparison, one cannot speculate as to the utility of anything.  All they have is a correlation, and correlation DOES NOT prove causality.    Hold it again. You dismiss a point about demographics, then you ask about socio-economic demographics? Very slick.  Once again, correlation does not prove causality.  Looking at pre-vs. post data, the Canadian gun law had no effect.   Sir, if you were a Canadian, and owned a gun before the restrictive gun laws were passed, and decided to hide it rather than turn it in, would you answer truthfully a question about gun ownership from someone who calls, writes, or asks you on the street?  That is one problem with surveys.  Nobody will answer an incriminating question. Another is that people will often tell you what they THINK you want to here.   Does that mean no Vancouver citizens have handguns? I think not.

Basic Scenario:   I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of  files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users   connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public  key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the  one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The  result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it  is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the  machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed  system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal  private keys during the authentication sequence.  Questions:   Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any  information useful for a search give me any protection as far as  being coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)   It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am  assisting in \\\"entrapment\\\" (the users would send thier key anyway  and are not being enticed into doing something they would not  otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?   Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?

Further, the early church bears testimony to the impact.   Of course they knew where it was. Don't forget that Jesus was seen by both the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker. Pilate was no fool and didn't  need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus' body to  make it appear He had arisen. Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a  man well know to the Sanhedrin, to say that they didn't know where He was buried begs the question.  Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think on this a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a  deliberate lie!? If not, then why do you think the disciples would!? Now, I'm not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth,  but unbeknown to you, it is a lie. Many have done this. No, I'm talking about dying, by beheading, stoning, crucifixion, etc., for something you know to be a lie! Thus, you position with regards to the disciples stealing the  body seems rather lightweight to me.  As for graverobbers, why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over  the body of Jesus? He wasn't buried with great riches. So, again, this is an argument that can be discounted.  That leaves you back on square one. What happened to the body!?

I've never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists that he has, so I'd love to have a cite.   Wrong.  There's one gun design where that can happen, and it is supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber. (Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under the hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe manner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their trigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.   The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the described circumstance) is near zero.

Science has its basis in observable fact.   I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on the values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such, is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human activity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or ethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.  Bill  : If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must : first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering : the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  : So, back to the original question:  : And objective morality is.....?  This may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory. Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of people. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The concept supposedly described may have meaning however.  If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then He has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His existence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed, He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an objective sense. If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective. If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous, meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to meet that standard is therefore objectively determined. Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural norm, or the preferred conduct of \\\"decent\\\" people, making it seem subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard. Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe.

From  the writings  of tye biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian, she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish gene mix is dynamite.  Levon K. Topuzian Assistant Professor Northwestern University Skoie, Illinois.  TIME, December 21, 1992 'Letters'   You have set up straw horses and knocked them down. I'm not impressed. Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.   Source: Stanford J. Shaw, on Armenian collaboration with invading Russian armies in 1914, \\\"History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey (Volume II: Reform, Revolution & Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808-1975).\\\" (London, Cambridge University Press 1977). pp. 315-316.  \\\"In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city   of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population,   closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan   on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized   and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during   the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the  southern side of the lake.\\\"  \\\"Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,  Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.  Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First  World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse  to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other  invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian  success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of  Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common  soldiers began deserting in droves.\\\"  \\\"With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of  World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy  increased drastically.

They knew the pitchers needed some help or they would be watching the sunrise. :)\",\"  The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13).  And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the inevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are doing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is possible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the eyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing people for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and Annias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His plan might be accomplished.     But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to execute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to fulfill the chorus of \\\"Let his blood be upon our hands\\\" of the crowd in Jersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel, which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish other nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament.  Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, \\\"Mene, mene, tekel, peres?\\\"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's justice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians as their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the extirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel.  The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and the Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go on with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is quite clear. Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to question why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom, He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans 9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of Jesus Christ is as follows: \\\"Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.\\\"  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - \\\"Let the dead bury the dead, come, follow me.\\\"  There is not an infinite amount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to follow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, \\\"well, alright, you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your plans.\\\"  He said \\\"Follow me.\\\"  His message is NOT \\\"I'm just a sweety-pie who would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and Divine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale.\\\"  \\\"Our great God and Savior\\\" Jesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the world.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.\",\"VHS movie for sale.

Letting one's mind roam freely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of coming up with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis of the problem first.    Scientific intuition is not something one is born with.  It is something that one learns.  Maybe we don't understand completely how it is learned, but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the  key elements in developing it.    Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding new scientific ideas.  One thinks, for instance, of Darwin's naturalistic studies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for the  theory of evolution.    This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes empirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal exploration as important scientific work.  I agree that mere speculation does not deserve to be called science.  I also think that mere empirical studies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very poor kind of science.

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper- work, and left for the Zhdanov District. That's in Azerbaijan, near the Nagorno Karabagh region.  After the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically in Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said \\\"uprising\\\" in Azerbaijani, but I don't think it was really an uprising, just a  demonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the  Zhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even  women; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here,  and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There were some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the Armenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site. I was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew  wouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really  bad. I didn't know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me, \\\"There's unrest everywhere, be careful.\\\" Well I had a project going on. I told the Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on  and said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn't allow it, they  said, \\\"Nothing's going to happen to you, we've entrusted the matter to the  police, we've warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.\\\"  Well, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he  knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This man didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and  afterward he spent the night with us, too.  I sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, \\\"The situation is very tense, be careful.\\\"  We finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the morning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I shouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else's business travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it  and my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus,  they sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out  they knew what was happening in Sumgait.  I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is closed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the  buses aren't running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two minutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private drivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, \\\"Let's go find some other way to get there.\\\" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to take us to Sumgait.  He took us there. But the others had said, \\\"I wouldn't go if you gave me a thousand rubles.\\\" \\\"Why?\\\" \\\"Because they're burning the city and killing the Armenians. There isn't an Armenian left.\\\" Well I got hold of myself so I could still stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we  set off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, \\\"In fact there aren't any Armenians left. 'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them.\\\" Well  I was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me,  \\\"How old are you, old man?\\\" He wants to know: if I'm being that quiet, not  saying anything, maybe it means I'm an Armenian. \\\"How old are you?\\\" he asks  me. I say, \\\"I'm 47.\\\" \\\"I'm 47 too, but I call you 'old man'.\\\" I say, \\\"It  depends on God, each person's life in this world is different.\\\" I look much older than my years, that's why he called me old man. Well after that he was silent, too.  We're approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon. Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he was waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I'm sitting there with them, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant there were no Armenians with us.  I look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the  street, you know, and there's no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They stopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature  shafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .  Along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's  not. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I'm an Armenian, but I speak  their language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for  \\\"nut,\\\" or \\\"little nut,\\\" as \\\"pundukh,\\\" but \\\"fundukh\\\" is actually correct. The  pronunciations are different. Anyone who says \\\"pundukh,\\\" even if they're not  Armenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says,  \\\"There was a car there, with five people inside it,\\\" he says. \\\"They started  hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn't let the people out,\\\" he says, \\\"they wouldn't let them get out of the car.\\\" I only saw  the car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from Baku to Sumgait and back . . .  When they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there's a short guy, his eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. \\\"We're Azerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no Armenians here.\\\" He did come up to me when  we were pulling our things out and says, \\\"Maybe you're an Armenian, old man?\\\"  But in Azerbaijani I say, \\\"You should be ashamed of yourself!\\\" And . . . he  left. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had  to . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own  home.  They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that's where the Kavkaz store  and three large, 12-story buildings are. That's the beginning of down-town. I  saw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I  couldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it  was a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing  remained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I saw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About 30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.  I see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are closed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the crowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots. Several shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier.  Someone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the  soldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one  armored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning  off Sumgait.  I walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by  their gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. I joined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us and asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see. But I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly  recognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer people. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block. I can't get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as  to get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking  behind him. And he's shouting into a megaphone: \\\"Comrades, the Armenian- Azerbaijani war has begun!\\\"  The police have megaphones like that. So they're talking and walking around  the second microdistrict. I see that they're coming my way, and turn off  behind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings,  and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every corner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were  doing I can't say, because I couldn't get up close to them, I was afraid. But  the most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least find out if my children were alive or not . . .

Hudson, you are screwing up again.  Morality does not (I say again, DOES NOT) define only \\\"right and wrong\\\".

That is irrational thinking.    There may also be people out there who think that death by atomic  destruction is  a sublime and wonderful thing. I am not going to let them execute that idea just because they want to do it.   Simply because I let people make up their minds about what morals they have doesn't prevent me from spotting and stopping a madman when I see one, Hudson.  And even then, I will only stop him when he interferes  with me and my life.  That is the difference between me and you:  you want to interfere in people's lives even when they aren't affecting you.        /(hudson) /The central character in Dostoevsky's novel, Crime and Punishment,  /(R something or other) reasoned that if killed this old Jewish woman and /stole her money to educate and establish himself financially, he could /make a great contribution to society.  He reasoned that she was not of  /much profit to society.  She just collected rents, and hoarded money.   One of the central points of any (that's ANY) moral system is that is has to be internally consistent.    By killing her, the character had to accept the premise that the ends justify the means.  If he accepted that premise, then (in order to be consistent), he must accept the idea that some day another person may apply the same standard to HIS life.  Now, if he is unwilling to accept this premise (which he will not be willing to accept), then he has behaved inconsistently with his own moral standard.      /(me) /[football example deleted]  /(hudson) /Now suppose a freshman on the bench will only get to play if one of the /players in the field/on the court is injured (or killed.)

The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace based on Godism.  The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God, the fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God's providence of restoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the World's religions.  Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may miss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000 years ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish people of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that John the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even questioned who Jesus was: \\\"is he the one who is to come or do we look for another\\\". (see book of Matthew)   David Koresh didn't even come close.  The problem is that people like this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real Messiah when he does show up.   Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for Christians: How to recognize the Second Coming?  The Messiah should not claim to be God.  What sets a Messiah apart is that he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born sinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God originally intended.  God's restoration providence is still not complete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God's representative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one God.  ...    Who else in this world is claiming to be the Messiah.  Maybe he's already here.\",\" Radius speculated, publicly, that they could provide a PowerPC-based Rocket for existing Macs. It would have the plus of RocketShare and the minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator, NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.  Apple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except perhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC slot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC accelerators.  One potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with Rocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.  Apple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in existing 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking prices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen much cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.  First generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed CPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later. This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled for clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which I doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do this, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where Apple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup is in order.  By the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC, Pentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor front for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies. Also, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all the other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent right now.  Once anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market position will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it might). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome battle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not guaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of several.\",\" > Hi there,  > Can anyone tell me where it is possible to purchase controls found  > on most arcade style games.

On the non-pacifist side:]  (1) Killing to defend the innocent may be, if anything, _more_ justifiable than killing in self-defense.  I can turn my _own_ other cheek, but I have no right to turn someone else's.  (2) It seems to me that if Jesus had meant to teach pacifism, He would have made His position more explicit.  He didn't tell the centurion to leave the army, for instance; and the NT is full of military metaphors.  [B. On the pacifist side:]  (1) Apparently many early Christians refused to fight in the Roman army, or stated that one should refuse if given a choice.  But it's not clear whether they were objecting to war _per se_, or objecting to Roman policies.  (2) In modern warfare, it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only at combatants.  Bombing, both conventional and nuclear, kills lots of civilians.  (3) It's hard to tell whether any _particular_ war is justified at the time.

No experimental result should be accepted unless it is described in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications do indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and reasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.  But people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy reasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a large part of the history of science.

For example, quarks are an accepted part of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What would be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical reality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could lie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of experimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.  (I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though. I don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather directly verifying the existence of qi.)  2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational experiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and interpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical controversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall, there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations, petty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which computations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical function of science: results don't count unless they can be replicated.  The whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate part can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.  Pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals; but even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed; that when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate polarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was indistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur's irrational motivation had led to a replicable, and important, result.  This is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their theories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not concede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress the results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they think supports their position (creationists).\",\"I am in charge of purchasing some computer software for a small office and I have a few question about Microsoft's Office Pack.    1)  I was wondering, are the programs that are packaged with the Office Pack--WinWord, Power Point, Excel, and ccMail--complete and the latest addition?  2) Are the programs \\\"hobbled\\\" in any way?   3) Can we update single programs at a latter date ( i.e. from Excel 4.0 to Excel 5) ?  4) Do you receive all of the necessary disks and documentation?  5) Is there anything that I should be aware of that makes the Office Package less of deal that it seems?

The surest route to disaster.  It's amazing, people never seem to learn from history (or common sense).  Price controls do not, and cannot work.

Few people know that the Pilgrims originally tried to have common property to grow food and a common food store.  Many people know the hardships they suffered the first few winters because of it.  After arriving, the Pilgrims made all property common.  They all shared in the work and the resulting crops went into a common store.  After much debate the new Governor Bradford privitized the land; assigning plots to each family.  According to Perry D. Westbrook:  \\\"The change was immediately justified by the increased industry of the inhabitants and by the larger acreage planted.\\\"  experience that was had in this common course and condition, tried sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the vanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some of later times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community into a commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiser than God.  For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed much confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort.\\\"  Bradford did not blame this failure on the \\\"strangers\\\", but on the basic selfishness in all men.  He wrote \\\"seeing all men have this corruption in them, God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them.\\\"  In other words, according to Westbrook, \\\"Bradford found private enterprise to be the most suitable economic policy for mankind in its fallen state.\\\"  Let's not make the same mistake that the Pilgrims made.

I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience can be trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something so materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess anything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were discussing the \\\"mind\\\" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal, as it were; and half spiritual.   ?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the ?possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do ?not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of ?Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage ?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know ?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This ?is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,           Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.   ?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain ?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain.  This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method.   ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?\\\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some ?

This message is a summary of the responses. Thanks to all of you that replied.    a) The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only, as far as I know.  The VLB    and EISA version should have no problems.   b) I'm pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn't    work in systems with over 16M Ram.  There is supposed to be way    of switching the \\\"memory aperture\\\" feature off to prevent this,    but apparently it doesn't work.  I posted some \\\"help me\\\" messages    on the net and people indicated that the EISA card didn't have this    problem.  c) FALSE  d) The VLB card, which I have, allows you to set memory aperture over 32M    by using their configuration software.  No messing with jumpers necessary.     The 32M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards.    a) Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM    (EISA and VLB) or 12 M (ISA).  32M should not be a problem for you.    b) Dunno.  c) Depends on the bus. YES if ISA, NO if EISA or Localbus    a) Nope.  I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all    non-interlaced.  b) Yes - According to PC Magazine, they've tested a local bus version    that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced.  c) Not for the Pro. Sometimes for the Plus.     Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. This has nothing to     do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. Note that for 24 bit color    and Windows you MUST have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding.    a) They aren't perfect, but are much improved.  I don't recall the last time which    I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due    to software incompatibility.  b) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54.  c) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain    graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they    do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..    other accelerated cards also have bugs.  d) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than    satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my    NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.     I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond    Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on    the old driver.    a) It's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.   b) Yes - I'll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what    I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)    every 20 minutes or so...  c) Depends on many many things.    a) I like it.  b) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is.  c) Yes, this appears to be true :-)  d) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are    coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.    Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer     at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was     developing at that time.  (PC Magazine, about two months or so back)     Overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- That is the end of the questions.

(Much thanks to Jayne K who is already supporting me with kind words and prayers!)  I've been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs.  I'm female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that on seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this company.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one; someone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.  I'm really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.  There was no note.  I do not know if it was:   - someone's idea of an innocent joke, that went awry  - someone's sick idea of flirting  - an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)  I dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question, I don't know the answer so I take a military specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a Bible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to Corinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love Association?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.  I can lock up my desk, but I can't lock up every book I have in the office.  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into my briefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home to find such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone wants to do to my body.  To make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for leaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go to the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one could be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my number was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a neutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite the fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer.  I need some prayers --- I can't stop crying. I am so deeply wounded that it's ridiculous.  I feel like I'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel like I'm a sub-human piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simple phone call saying \\\"We're leaving for Mary's lunch a little early so that Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting...\\\"  Please pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously turned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing me so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray for my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a whole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This company, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment isn't tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or threatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven times in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company do me no good when I'm terrified or healing from the latest assault.)  And please pray that I don't turn into an automaton because of this. That's my bad habit: \\\"ignore it and it will go away\\\", \\\"you're not worth anyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this\\\", \\\"you're right, you are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this way\\\", \\\"you are just an object\\\", \\\"you prostitute your mind to this company so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there as well?\\\", \\\"what makes you think women aren't just possessions, and nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\\\" This is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major depressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don't come into my head and stay there, triggering depression.  Please pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and God. In a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to God, and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesn't drop me from his loving hand, but it's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand, look down, think I'm falling and forget that God's still holding on to me.)  Although this probably isn't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup, I really can use the kind of loving support you all provide.  For this reason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence.  After all, he's allowed me the thermometer note, and a few other off-the-wall topics.

If you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent.  However, if a professional thief wants your vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:  1) ignition kill or fuel cut-off 2) a flashing red LED  These two are basic to a decent alarm system.   To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock. That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target. But, then there's always car-jacking.   Why is life so confusing?

So there's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a given context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely and makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other hand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which eventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  \\\"You people call THIS science?\\\"   (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)    Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor appropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is  ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science.     My second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this is true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.  Within mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before the twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later  mathematicians did prove them, of course.)    I think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not so much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a  matter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of  incompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to  objectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an essential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step  of the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward  that goal then one is not doing science.)  When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and seems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further investigation.     Admittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable amount of effort in a \\\"serious scholarly investigation\\\" such as I suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately  specific question to try and answer.    The \\\"science\\\" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science  currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.   I certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use  of \\\"reason and observation.\\\"  One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.    Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with the study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there  is any existing research related to this question.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"BOAT For SALE 1989 23' IMPERIAL FISHERMAN featuring         Walkaround Cuddy Cabin, 305 V8 with VOLVO DUO PROP OUTDRIVE /\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/ AM-FM Cassette Stereo, VHF RADIO, 4x6 HUMMINGBIRD Fishfinder, ALL  Safty equipment, Covers, and MUCH MORE.           18000 LB.

Blackman, Research Coordinator for NRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89. -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear sir:  By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of  momentus \\\"scientific\\\" findings. These are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings. Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists.  The latest effort -- \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities,\\\" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying  editorial, \\\"Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,\\\" by two employees of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular order.   1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to   support the statement that \\\"some have argued that restricting  access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate  of homicide.\\\" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that  contention.    2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very  similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,  demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities  are very different with very different demographic characteristics  which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in  Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white  and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be  the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-  grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various  ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.    3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,  compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all  the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect  in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-  1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth  involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM  article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving  handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that  one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding  that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that  a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day  for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without  at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?    4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national  gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily  selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because  it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific  reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which  involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar \\\"control\\\"?  Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite  \\\"scientific\\\" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide  rate *exceeds* that of such \\\"wild west\\\" cities in Texas as  El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado  Springs. (Ref. 3)    5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or  handguns \\\"are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in  Vancouver.\\\" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending  to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is  an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry  permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in  Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of  handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun  owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number  of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns  for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns  legally for protection, registration figures are  meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York  City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,  that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population  in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver  has a greater \\\"prevalence of weapons\\\" than New York City.    The second method of measuring gun density is \\\"Cook's gun  prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity  differences.\\\" But the validation was by Cook of his own  theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a  different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is  based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement  in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking  a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide  (42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in  homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in  Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-  ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and  Vancouver.    6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and  Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that  Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to  the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian  law for owning and carrying handguns for personal  protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more  difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually  the case.    7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain  the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the  penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of   clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a  firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number  of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making  arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest  rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences  imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,  or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social  scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,  the authors of the NEJM \\\"tale of two cities\\\" fail even to mention  most factors related to crime control.    8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective  means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not  the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost  650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from  criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the  liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be  completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury  to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors  reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides  without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle  accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides  involving firearms.    9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the \\\"study,\\\"  editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it \\\"applied  scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb  advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly  handguns.\\\" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly  be mistaken for \\\"scientific methods\\\" by a sociologists or  criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle \\\"study\\\" is the equivolent  of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding  two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25  and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,  administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while  giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure  and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure,   announcing in a \\\"special article\\\" a new medical breakthrough.  It would be nice to think that such a \\\"study\\\" would neither be  funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.    Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC  make them willing to present shoddy research as \\\"scientific  breakthroughs\\\" in \\\"special articles\\\" and editorials relating  to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying  the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight  over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about  the distortions contained in \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,  and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities\\\" and \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call  for Science.\\\" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside  whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize  an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.

Wright           (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)     suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\\\"  The problem is demonstrated    by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting    to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by    the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal    of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and    suggested that a handgun ban \\\"may reduce the rate of homicide in a     community.\\\"       The nine medical doctors who published \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime,    Assaults, and Homicide\\\" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite    many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver    has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations    make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems    indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period    1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.    Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,    Why?       The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case    to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,    that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their    evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and     unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point    does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support    of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody    knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We    are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that    a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates    when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.       Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two    indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-    weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons    permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the    permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable. *     The second bit of evidence is \\\"Cook's gun prevalence index,\\\" which stands *  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index *  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in  *  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage *  of homicides and suicides involving firearms. *     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides, *  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take *  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be *  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides *  is directly related to their relative availability in the general  *  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To *  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to \\\"prove\\\" it on the basis of *  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.       Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that    guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.    The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun    ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates    reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,    that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.       In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of    violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the     consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin     Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime    for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke    an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.       Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data    on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are \\\"similar in    many ways,\\\" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law    stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish    the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that \\\"all    else is equal\\\" among things being compared. *     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look  *  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime *  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage *  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle *  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent. *  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the *  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half- *  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown *  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out. *     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is *  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates *  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide *  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver. *  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due *  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks, *  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics *  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison *  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial *  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle *  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain *  in either city.       Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the    cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority     groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in \\\"gun availability\\\"    (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not    matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why    blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed    in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,    do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)       Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between    Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have     anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol     abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city    of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the     Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the    United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian    percentage?       The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many    ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent    more detailed analysis, nearly any of these \\\"many ways\\\" might explain part    or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such    as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal. *     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide *  result in a \\\"complex picture.\\\"  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing *  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They *  also acknowledge that \\\"socio-economic status is probably an important *  confounding factor in our comparison,\\\" remarking further that \\\"blacks    *  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of *  Vancouver's population.\\\"  Given the evidence presented in the article, *  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle *  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial *  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility, *  since \\\"detailed information about household incomes according to race *  is not available for Vancouver.\\\"       The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in     gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple    example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms    of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one     would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.    Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce     crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into    account?  In this example, the \\\"hidden variable\\\" is city size: Guns are    more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city    problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the    appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very    seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities    for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,    and their results are impossible to interpret.       In the editorial \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science\\\" accompanying    the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the    authors for applying \\\"scientific methods\\\" to a problem of grave public    heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from    nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate    plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them    out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are    little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this    study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical    identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--    is cause for further concern.

What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith (i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal revelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God  must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would  honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone  who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are  rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient  for them, or because they wish to spurn God.  I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one  holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is  that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with God.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or  revealed that truth.    --  comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\",\" It just occurred to me why the algorithm is secret.

I will make the case here though and try to help you out:  8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9).  Yes, it is by God's grace and our faith that we are saved.  We are not saved by what we do.  However,  15 If ye love me, keep my commandments. (John 14:15).  Keeping Christ's commandments is a \\\"work\\\" per se, and a demonstration of our love for him.  Also,  6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. 7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? 8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: 9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. (Luke 13:6-9).  Again,  16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. (John 15:16).  It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit.  What is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being love, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest in the actions that we carry out.  If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things Christ commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith.  Asking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your pants is more important.  Good works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith, true faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs commands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit, then we shall be uprooted just like the tree.   It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for days about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a building and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you all day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really don't have that faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the test.  Words and talk mean nothing.  I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but this should be sufficient.  Hope it helped.

Admittedly this was many years ago when I was young.  Since then I just make sure I don't get stung.  I also should carry a bee sting kit with me, but I don't.    This isn't scientific or proof, but this would lead me to believe it's not a different reaction, just a different degree of reaction.  Allergies work that way.  People have various reactions.  Sort of like diabetes, some people can get by with just monitoring their diet, others have to monitor their diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their diet like a hawk and use insulin regularly.    I think MSG is probably similar...some people have allergic reactions to it.  Some people are allergic to fermented things and can't use soy sauce...but the chinese have been using it for centuries... that doesn't necessarily mean that it's safe for everyone.  \",\" The fantasy was that he had found something of fundamental importance to one of the hot questions of the day ('77).  He really had very little reason to believe it, other than raw hope.  By fantasy, I certainly don't mean Velikovskian manias.   I'm not familiar with the history of this experiment, although, arguably, I should be.   I think that it is enough if his contemporaries found the result surprising. That's not what I'd quibble about.  What I'd like to know are Toricelli's reasons for doing his experiment; not the post hoc _constructed_ reasons, but the thoughts in his head as he considered the problem.  It may be impossible to know much about Toricelli's thoughts; that's too bad if it is so.  One of Root-Bernstein's services to science is that he has gone rooting about in Pasteur's and Fleming's (and other people's) notes, and has discovered some surprising clues about their motivations.  Pasteur never publicly admitted his plan to create mirror-image life, but the dreams are right there in his notebooks (finally public after many years), ready for anyone to read.  And I and my friends often have the most ridiculous reasons for pursuing results; one of my best came because I was mad at a colleague for a poorly-written claim (I disproved the claim).  Of course, Toricelli's case may be an example of a rarety: where the fantasy not only motivates the experiment, but turns out to be right in the end.

In my encounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth.  According to them, their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of God and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way. Their way is the 'truth.'  But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason, but it seems to me a choice.  My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when I was in grade school:  A kid would say, \\\"All policemen are jerks!\\\"  I'd ask, \\\"How do you know?\\\"  \\\"Because my daddy told me so!\\\"  \\\"How do you know you're daddy is right?\\\"  \\\"He says he's always right!\\\"  Well the argument usually stops right there.  In the end, aren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as false?  -------------  This is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I apologize if I'm covering tired old ground.  Some of the discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome any comments.  --   [I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  I can understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough evidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for other religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of intelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that doesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who believe Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict it are false.  This suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than the Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where people choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent spiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in some unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of one sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But Christianity is in its essense a \\\"historical\\\" religion.  That is, it's based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out there, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways, and that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \\\"mundane\\\" world, we are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it falls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The Christian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual external reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know everything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that implies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't see how else we could proceed.  This needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking with people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and even if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.\",\"The Roman Catholic conservatives are coming out in the open to line up with Pat Robertson and his ultra Right Wing Christian Coalition. Former Secretary of Education William Bennet, a Roman Catholic, stood beside the Christian Coalition's spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 3 conference in Washington.  The purpose of the conference was to publish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed to prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it backed away from the \\\"Family Values\\\" positons of the '92 convention.  Conservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson's organization with political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications support.  The Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version of the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes. Ms. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom Council in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.  Ms. Elwell was hired by Domino's Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989 to manage Legatus, a \\\"nonpolitical\\\", Catholic businessmen's group. Membership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4 million in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts at Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the Catholic Campaign.  The Campaign's list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep. Robert K. Dornan, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, the lovely Pat Buchanan and Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus.   Also on the national committee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice.  Another Catholic, Thomas Patrick Monaghan, senior counsel of Robertson's ACLJ, is also an active supporter of the Catholic Campaign.  The board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare, broadcasting exec and former U.S. ambassador to the Pope, Wall Street executive Frank Lynch, former Reagan official Richard V.

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call Japan, etc.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would greatly appreciate your sending it to me.

He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19).  However, if he enjoyed punishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus to \\\"seek and save that which was lost\\\" (Luke 19:10)?  You asked for it.  2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished. Matthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in God's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity. 2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the disciples \\\"will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord\\\". 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth being condemned. Revelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes and those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in the \\\"fiery lake of burning sulfur\\\". Revelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast \\\"will be tormented with burning sulfur\\\" and there being \\\"no rest day or night\\\" for them because of it. Psalm 9:17:  \\\"The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that forget God.\\\"  I think those should be sufficient to prove the point.   Joe Fisher  [In the following I'm mostly playing \\\"devil's advocate\\\".  I'm not advocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that it's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible to see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often uses the term \\\"second death\\\".  The most obvious understanding of that would seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks both of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms that can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince you of one view or the other, but to help people understand that there's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to understand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire, whatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35 implies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably they just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to  understand this passage in a non-literal way.)  2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them in hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.  Matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is eternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever. Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been prepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the eternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet will be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being thrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \\\"the second death\\\". This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as the devil, and humans?  2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \\\"everlasting destruction\\\"? This is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be understood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in eternity.  2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction. Revelation 21:6-8: see comment above Revelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there, it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says that the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that  there is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people are tormented forever.  Psalm 9:17:  I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.\",\"Has anyone had problems with Ami Pro 3.0 after running PCTools (v7.1) compress?

The basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on the biblical text.  Luke's account is highly suspect (I would refer you to the hermeneia commentary on Acts).  Moreover Luke's account is written at least 90 years after the fact.  In the meantime everyone he mentions has died and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established. Moreover, Pauls account of some of the events in Acts (as recorded in  Galatians) fail to establish the acts accounts.

Yes!  So were their non-Christian contemporaries (the more familiar you are with late Republican Rome or the Pricipate, the weirder those people will seem -- forget the creative filtering done by Renaissance and Eighteenth Century hero worship.)  So are modern non-Christians.  And Christians.  You are pretty weird, yourself, with your rather acid dismissal of Luther and of Protestantism -- and in apparently buying into a simplistic propaganda model about Catholicism *not* being faddish.   Sure, it's so large that global fads take longer cycles than they do in smaller denominations (and local ones are not usually visible unless you do a lot of traveling to exotic lands :-)).  May I recom- mend, as a salutary antidote to this nonsense Philippe Aries' book _The Hour of our Death_, a longitudinal study of death customs in  Western [specifically Catholic] Christendom?  And it won't help to escape into the obscurity of the first Christian century.  Paul was pretty weird, too; as were Peter and the others in the (apparently quite weird) circle around Jesus.  What I think you might find helpful is a bit more charity -- try to understand these weirdos and nutcases with the same respect and love you would expect others to show YOUR notions.  We *are* commanded to love one another, after all.  And Brown's book is, in fact, a heroic attempt to SEE the groupings he talks about as motivated in love and the gospel and their social contexts.  (If anything, Brown is *too* heroic here -- he manages to overstrain himself at times :-))  I don't suggest that we *follow* any of these old cult paths -- and it raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much of early Christianity *was* like the weird (Christian and non-Christian) cults we see today.  To that extent, I think you raise a serious problem (and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self-deprecatory and ironic.)  But the first principle for *answering* these questions is respect and love for those we do not understand.  And it helps to *work* at under- standing (as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and begin to withdraw our respect for them as people.)  I would advise, in other words, MORE historical reading (Brown's other books are also good, most especially his bio. of Augustine; also try Robin Lane Fox's _Christians and Pagans_, maybe the Paul Veyne ed. _History of Private Life_, some of Foucault's books on sexuality in the ancient world ...)

This is   a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had   any problems with it.    It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than    a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better    suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non   competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.   You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear   changes.      The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike   very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot).  There is a   custom made carbon/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect   the engine cases and the water pump.  The steering angle has been reduced    by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. This with the suspension tune-up   by Phil Douglas of Aftershock (Multiple time ISDE rider) gives it a better   ride than most bike: plush suspension, responsive steering with no head shake.\",\"I was wondering if the FAQ files could be posted quarterly rather than monthly.

I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in \\\"contraceptive technology\\\" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.    Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't we teach \\\"safe drug use\\\" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it because we know that a class in \\\"how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs\\\" would increase drug use?  Why isn't \\\"drug abstinence education\\\" barred from schools because it teaches \\\"religion\\\"?  Aren't we abandoning those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe use?  \",\"Does anybody have a GIF of the Tiger Stadium seating chart?

There is an option (BIOS I think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to CPU/VL bus transactions.  This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives the VL bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'.  These particular wait(s) are applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus device(s).  You want to enable these wait(s) only if you are using a 50-DX with VL bus devices.  This is from reading my motherboard manual, and these are my interpre- tations.  Your mileage may vary.

Assuming that there is an absolute morality, two disagreeing  objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right; there is no room for compromise.

Today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique I'd never seen before.  He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil. The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray, made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.  In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.  On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.  Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises and concerns me are:  1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?  2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color     (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring     agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected     it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,     caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being     used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?  3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated     as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract     from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever     happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea     could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do     so.  WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens), I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips, getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process, then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.  My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff, just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?  I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.  And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually has some standing, don't know about the others.\",\" My Beckman died a few days ago, thanks do about a 4 or 5 foot drop onto a lab table.  !@#!@$#!@$@#$  Probably not indicative of anything, but I've already filled out the requisition for a Fluke 87. :-)  Oh yeah, and sometimes our measurements here do count.

I haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a couple of things jumped out at me.  First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of weapon used in self defense.  1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to \\\"weapon.\\\" The second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w/gun defenses reported *fell* by almost 25%.  Unless there's an explanation for this, I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going  ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time.        Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, and not just a reporting difference?

It seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment, will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it is a part of it.     Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them within their borders?    [...]  You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade? Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes she had, however, is  the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians are attacking Azeri  towns.  Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  going to cause incessant skirmishes.  Think of 10 or 20 years down the  line -- both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe the other out.  These people will be neighbors, would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal?  If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of their blood and future.  It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.

One time a friend of mine at Sun sent me an e-mail.  He composed it using the Sun OpenWindows 3 \\\"mailtool\\\" which handles (non-MIME) \\\"attachments\\\" and the like.  Since I don't use \\\"mailtool\\\", I had to manually save it, cut & paste, and then \\\"uudecode\\\" the actual attachment.  What I got - after a not-inconsiderable amount of time spent doing this - was an audio file.  The original message was over 32Kb of mail headers and uuencoded data; the resulting audio message was a single sentence that I transcribed as a 135 character message.  If he had sent me the sentence in plain text, the e-mail would have been around 250 bytes, and it would have taken me about 3 seconds to process it at most.  Instead, it was 32k and it took at least a minute.  A complete waste of (my) time and bandwidth, as far as I'm concerned.  Sending plain text is still the most efficient method of transmission, given the same transport mechanism.

I made a decision to accept the truth-claims of Christianity after having given it a lot of thought.

Also, my Calvinist should rest assured that I don't lay any of the responsibility for the outcome [my conversion] on anyone but God.)

I grew up in the shadow of [generic authoritarian conservative denomination], and I *knew* that that wasn't a way of life that I could adopt.

That's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you want one, you are still innocent until proven guilty.  Cops are not the only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes, anyone who witnesses a crime can do so.  Go to the Highway Patrol and explain the situation, give them a description of the car and the license number, and tell them the specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute (ie, search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy).  Fill out the ticket and sign it.  It will go through the same system any ticket a cop writes goes through.  If contested, you will have to appear in court to prosecute.

I have a IIsi that came with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.   First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for over two months.  The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of shorts or bad connections.  Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again, and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not damaged, and I can go back to the original setup.  Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this day.   In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal should be terminated at all the ends.

You know, Sam, when people start talking about an International Jewish conspiracy, its really begins to sound like anti-Semitic bull.   The reason there is no conspiracy here is quite simple. Zionists made no bones about what was going on.  There were conferences, publications, etc, all talking about creating a National home for the Jews.    [...]   Because you've never heard of it, its dead?  The fact is, you claimed Israel had to give arabs rights because of (non-existant) International aid.  Then you see that that argument has a hole you could drive a truck through, and again assert that Israel is only democratic within the (unexplained) constraints of one ethnic group. The problem with that argument is that Arabs are allowed to vote for whoever they please.  So, please tell me, Sam, what constraints are there on Israeli democracy that don't exist in other democratic states?   I've never heard anything about the Khazakistani arab population.  Does that mean that they have no history or roots?  When I was at Ben Gurion university in Israel, one of my neighbors was an Israeli arab.  He wasn't really all that different from my other neighbors.  Does that make him dead or oppressed?     How recent is recent?  I can probably build a case for a Jewish Gaza city.  It would be pretty silly, but I could do it.  I'm arguing not that Jerusalem is Jewish, but that land has no ethnicity.

We were there to discuss SSTO, and commercial space.  This is how it went...    After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO, I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard the gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour. Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.  We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide, who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to  make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.  Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening. We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.   Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that we brought up.  But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space. So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to LEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming  feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that. We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog over L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is  more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to  understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education  whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday  would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.  We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided in those sectors.  Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc.. We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.  We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.  We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan), and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to LEO.  In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data  Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it. He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it, and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually happen immediatly there.  The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who really did know the answers.  Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this would be something that she would be very interested in, although they do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the state 1 week out of 6 these days.  All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\",\"+ +I know of no law, either on the books or proposed, that bans motorcycles +from any place that i want to go to.  Many private places ban bikes.  For example, the famous 17 mile drive at the Monterrey Peninsula.  And I have stayed at resorts that sported a \\\"No motorcycles allowed\\\" sign at the entrance.  And there have been public places.  Call the AMA and ask for Jim Bensberg (sp?) or any one else in their Legislative Office. They will recound the many public places that they had to bring to court to reverse their ban on bikes.  That includes everything from public parks to full cities.  There are probably a few fights on their books as we now speak.  That is another good reason to donate to their legislative fund. ____________________________________________________________________________    Death is life's way of telling you you've been fired  -- R. Geis\",\"or there   Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.  The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was because of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by scanning this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines).  When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \\\"I want to play a mono sound\\\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted the documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound.  Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from the IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.  Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware, and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase works. On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra 700/900/950 at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel only. Both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification, but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.  If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their games will only come out the left on some games.  The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related. It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what machine you have.  Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list: and also Hellcats, Super Tetris Oxyd (and many more, these are just what I've tested)  Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.   Other games you list: and also PGA Tour Golf Civilization (and more, these are again only from personal experience)  Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.  The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT! Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to do, but I'm going say it anyway. Stop cheating on sound! Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period is about to end. The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will work even better soon, so use it.  In conclusion: To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug. To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all hardware.   Have fun.  Disclaimer number 1: I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed. So don't write me with sound questions.  Disclaimer number 2: If it says up above that I wrote anything like \\\"the grace period is about to end\\\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.  Disclaimer number 3: I don't speak for Apple, just me.\",\" Not quite correct.  Biblical teaching expects us to celebrate the resurrection of Christ not once a year but every time someone is baptized.  Col. 2:12-Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.\\\"  Rom. 6:4-Therefore we are buried with him in baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\\\" Those really want to celebrate the resurrection should by faith walk in newness of life after baptism.  It is not necessary to celebrate a pagan goddess in the process.  Paul answered your question in Romans 9.  In v. 4 he stated that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the promises were given to the Israelites.  It is a package deal.  He goes on to identify those who are true Israelites.  Vs 6-8 makes it plain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way but those who accept the promise of God.  Paul continued to emphasize that he was an Israelite in 2 Cor. 11:22, then in Gal 3:29 he says that all those who belong to Christ are Abraham's seed, and heirs to all the promises given to the Israelites.  The promises come with the law.  It is all or nothing.  Why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law?  Certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you.  Or do you believe that adultery is no longer forbidden?  Same law.  BTW  please give a reference for your statement that the Gentiles are only required to observe the basis commandmants.

In splicing them    together it is not my intention to change Steve's meaning or misrepresent   him in any way.  I don't *think* I've done so. ]   Part of what started this was my earlier example of Illinois, USA requiring anyone doing more than X automobile transfers a year (X = 10, I think) to become licensed as a used car dealer.

Steve, let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resell cars.

You can use your money to fix up that car.  Since it is your car, you can sell that car.  Your life is truly yours; it belongs to you.  It matters not if someone thinks that it's \\\"wrong\\\" for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 months rather than, say, 9 cars.  They may dissaprove, but it is not their life or their money, it is your life and your money.  My money is truly mine; it belongs to me.  I can use it to buy a car. Perhaps your car.  Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewhere dissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying.  That someone could go to the government and insist that the government make us stop it.

The question you ask is complicated and deserves an honest answer. I am going to provide one from my own current perspective, not a historical one.  Currently, as a non-observant jew/Israeli/American, my own feeling is that Jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in Palestine or Israel, than the palestinians or Israelis (both arab and jew) do. With regard to Jewish Israelis, they should have the same rights in Israel as do all other Israelis.   Who are them?  If by them you mean the non-religious Jews, I think you should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their supporters are religious.  The other part of the problem is, to my knowledge, not that the palestinians don't want to be a part of Israel, as much as they would accept (for the most part) being full citizens of Israel, with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded Israeli citizens.

The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue first, and only using SetValue if the required location is different. The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the location of the popup, so that the SetValue really does change the location of the popup.

Unless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys from men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex (due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the children from abuse by members of the *same* sex.

I agree there may be other villages where the civilian population has deserted because it is too close to Israeli lines and thus gets bombed more often.  In such villages often the only remaining  inhabitants are guerillas and some elderly who have nowhere else to go. But for the most part the typical South Lebanon village is more like mine.  One where civilians and guerillas live together.  They are often inhabiting the same house.  Many families are large, some have members of the families involved in Hizollah, most others are not.  That is what is so hard of South Lebanon, Israel is not fighting an army with well drawn battle lines, but a guerilla tyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blends with the local populace.  Not because they are evil cowards that use women and children as shields, but because that is the only way one can fight a more powerful better equipped occupying army.   Hizbollah and Amal are now the main two militias.  Though Hizbollah people tend to be more committed to resistrance operation and better motivated by religious conviction.    As to retaliation,  It may be a mixture of what we both say.  Sometimes Israel chooses its targets carefully.  At other times it just sends its pilots on sorties aimed at a town in general since it only knows that the  attackers came from that specific village but has no further intelligence.  On several occasions Israel retalliated against  civilian refugee camps, even in North Lebanon, just to show that it will not sit idly after its soldiers have been attacked. Most of the time it directs the SLA to do the dirty work and indiscriminately shell some Lebanese villages on the other side. I have experienced this shelling myself on several occasions, this is why the SLA militia is sometimes even more despised than  Israeli troops.   I hope you are right on Israeli willingness to withdraw, but I still contend that withdrawal would be the better course for Israel's security, since it would reduce its  military losses, and I claim that the Lebanese and Syrian gov'ts would be able to prevent any  further attacks on Northern Israel.     Hmm...  Here we disagree on what serves Syria interests better. I think Syria wants to have Lebanon all to itself.  It would be willing to guarantee Northern Israel's security in return for Israeli withdrawal.  I don't think Syria wants Israel to be involved in its protectorate of Lebanon.  Syria is sitting at the negotiating table because it has come to accept that and wants to get a political resolution.  A renewal of hostilities along the Lebanese front could put the whole ME peace negotiations back in question.

Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple (early March).  Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is it because too many people take French and German in college to make the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance. Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.   For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.  Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.   Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care.  At that point, they wouldn't even consider a \\\"voucher\\\" approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.   It is \\\"free\\\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda.  The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer  1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For  1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance. Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.   Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.  When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's public health insurance plan.  gld\",\"   The commercial uses of a transportation system between already-settled- and-civilized areas are obvious.  Spaceflight is NOT in this position. The correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the long transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn't require gov't to fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit at the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private. But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.   I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop, and large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you ask me for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, I can't give them.  We just don't know enough.  The launch rate demanded by existing space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, and we are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries will be, when they will practical, how much will have to be invested to start them, etc. \",\"I'm having an X resource problem using Brian Wilson's wscrawl 2.0 (a wonderful interactive conferencing program, by the way).

Ahola had only played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points); it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be ... Peter Ahola.  #24 DOUG WILSON  Season: 16th Acquired: '91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and   2nd round pick in '92 entry draft Grade:  I (B)  I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out. Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which, unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for 2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be Wilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.  #29 DEAN KOLSTAD  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (C-/D+)  It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games, he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.  #38 PAT MACLEOD  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (?)  MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment, a \\\"rehab assignment\\\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs. Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills.  #41 TOM PEDERSON  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (B+)  Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in 43 games.  However, his size (5' 9\\\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically, on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach. But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.  #45 CLAUDIO SCREMIN  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (D+/D)  He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.\",\"If I have one thing to say about \\\"No Fault\\\" it would be \\\"It isn't\\\"\",\"I am using DOS Quick C 2.5 in a DOS window under Windows 3.1, and the other day while I was running the compiler, I got a general protection fault immediately followed by a \\\"serious disk error\\\".  When I rebooted, I found that about 15 files had gotten \\\"cross-linked\\\" which is a pretty serious corruption of the hard drive file system.  I am concerned that Quick C in a DOS window has somehow strayed outside its protected mode world and corrupted the smartdrv.exe disk cache and that is what caused the disk problem.  I thought that DOS programs run in DOS windows were pretty well-contained  by Windows.  If that is true, then maybe the Quick C compiler has nothing  to do with it.  Has anybody else had this type of problem?  (I only recently \\\"upgraded\\\" from Quick C 2.0 to 2.5.)

I said before the Holocaust. I'm not ignorant of the Holocaust and know more about Nazi Germany than most people (maybe including you).   What I resent is ignorant statements that call people names when they disagree with your position. Opposing the atrocities commited by the Israeli governement hardly qualifies as anti-semitism. If you think name calling is a valid form of argument in intellectual circles, you need to get out more often.  I don't think the suffering of some Jews during WWII justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government. Any attempt to call Civil liberterians like myself anti-semetic is not appreciated.

If  you asked  somone,  who  had never heard of hockey before, if LA played in the Smythe division what do you think  that  the  response  would  be? What  if you asked this person if LA played in the West division?  The naming of  divisions  after  long-dead  entrepreneurs  is  unnecessary obfuscation.    Hardly.  The \\\"established\\\" situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al. The  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team could successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  did was formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop- olistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth- er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly debatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de- bate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made, however, is that people played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smythe and his pals showed up.   What's wrong with best defenceman, period?  Was there  ever  a  better defenceman?   Was  there  ever a better player?  And if you think that Bruce Norris' contribution was somehow  more  significant  than  Bobby Orr's  then,  in the interests of education, why don't you take a poll and find out how many people know who Norris was?  But you don't  have to, do you?   So you don't feel that you should have to make the effort to  remember that  Vancouver  plays in the West division?

Both of them came from a CompuAdd computer I bought last August and am    presently upgrading. Here are the specs--  Motherboard ----------- Cyrix 486SL 25 MHz microprocessor Chips and Technology chipset (SCATsx V2.3.6 SLSLC) 8 SIMM banks for a maximum of 32 Megs of RAM BUILT-IN Floppy and Hard Drive Controllers BUILT-IN ports--1 Parallel, 2 Serial (9 and 25 pin) BUILT-IN Paradise SVGA controller with 1 meg of RAM (Windows drivers inc.)    -can do up to 1024x768 @ 256 colors    -based on the Western Digital WD90C31 chip Math co-processor slot 3 16-bit expansion slots and 2 8-bit expansion slots  Case ---- Low-Profile Desktop Very nice grey color 150 watt power supply Room for 2 floppies plus HD  Mouse ----- 3-button Microsoft-compatible Grey color matches case  All original manuals and documentation, video drivers, etc. are included.  You are probably wondering why I must sell the case with the motherboard. It is simply because the case is custom-made for this particular board and   you would be hard-pressed to fit another MB in it.  However, the case and   this motherboard were made to go together and fit perfectly.  As you can see, since this board includes drive controllers AND a video    controller, you can save some money by buying this unit and not a MB   where you would need to get IO cards, video card, and drive controllers   Its just a lot more convenient on the whole  I would like to ask about $500 for this whole package.  I think this is a fair   price given the facts that it includes a video card and drive controllers/IO   ports.  All you need to do is add drives, a monitor, RAM, and a keyboard.    Also keep in mind that it isn't a generic board, but from CompuAdd. I also will entertain all serious offers.

Their documents have decayed to dust too.  Brian, why another excuse?    Peter wrote a bit of the Bible.  What Peter says about God is what the Bible says.      Consider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands of years, various people come up and testify of their experience with the living God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses, once the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes David, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King  Nebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes Nehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent takes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use to kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up comes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself. Up comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS agents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years with people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself \\\"I am.\\\"   While you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that King David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known Matthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these people are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet all of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells of his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is different, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly reveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God. What Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of Babylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different perspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony dares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness's testimony, even though different from those prior, consistently describes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.    Now.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic on the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  \\\"I am\\\".  He has revealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58). Please believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.\",\" Amishware has one included in their package.

Wirewrap gets into trouble at much higher frequencies than any TTL can handle.

Hand-powered is a terrible choice (IMHO) unless you are a field maintenance person who will do maybe a dozen connections at a time.  Your hands will cramp.

Some new drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some* track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.  I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.  Hope this helps.\",\"Archive-name: rec-autos/part4  [this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions of general consumer interest, and is broken out to facilitate crossposting to misc.consumers -- rpw]  [last change: 8 February 1993; CT now permits radar detector usage,     new tire-traction q&a -- rpw]                  Commonly Asked Questions  Radar Questions:  Q:  Where are radar detectors illegal?  A:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit     all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in     large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,     Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They     are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.     Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other     jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.  Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?  A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,     but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe     to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.     They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently     available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate     more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.     New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected     by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a     detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned     on.  Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?  A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance     computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target     vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR     system.  Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be     able to handle it?   A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US     in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a     low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the     direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the     radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.     Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low     power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar     detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,     although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such     capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use     is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:     learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they     are used (or else, don't speed.)  Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?  A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.     Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.     Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the     military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the     Federal Communications Commission of the USA.  Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:  Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?  A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a     car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)     Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to     be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they     tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',     or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)     Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that     untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into     trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle     in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance     oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing     throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle     may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or     spinning.      Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car     will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the     angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling     and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to     travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle     than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater     slip angle than the front wheels.  Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?  A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear    than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally    you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop    rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle    before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to    the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.  Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?  A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while    braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot    for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you    use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to    match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;    often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side    on the throttle.     Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the    left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing    the same thing.  Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?  A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of    three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for    declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the    transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with    rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch    engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission    speed up.     The procedure is as follows:    (0) declutch    (1) move gearshift lever to neutral    (2) engage clutch    (3) match revs    (4) declutch    (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear    (6) engage clutch     This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.    The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the    synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or    with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.    Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at    all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good    condition.  Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and    slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?  A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and    2) almost never.     In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times    in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the    same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine    that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite    pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from    driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*    major) part of the equation.     Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really    only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically    when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the    comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.    This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads    are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply    of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.     Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the    automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced    by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the    car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making    a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end    of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car    has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'    setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of    caveats could go on for page after page.  Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according    to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate    or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?  A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.     2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics    textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,    none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a    stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating    temperature.     Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser    extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a    substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been    coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match    the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire    at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses    inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling    friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire    is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will    be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its    proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some    part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like    to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.    (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal    street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of    high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)     Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,    it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters    accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than    1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible    for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of    grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques    such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?

A:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and     Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,     which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some     financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may     be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this     is only speculation at this time.\",\" One of the rules for a permanent swap file is that it must be contiguous (non-fragmented) space.

ITOS is my favorite looking satellite, followed by AmSat-OSCAR 13  (AO-13).   TTYL 73 Jim\",\"      If I remember correctly (Which is always in doubt), Horner's signing with the Braves was contingent on starting in Atlanta.  I think he could have gone back to Arizona St. for one more year if he hadn't signed.  Anyhow, the Braves did try to send him to Richmond once; it lead to a week-long walkout.  Methinks Horner had no work ethic before he was drafted, and minor league play wouldn't have helped. But his raw talent would have gotten him into the ML, and it did keep him there for a while, until he started falling on his wrists.  \",\"     We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu- tion  from the rest of the team's.  There is only one way of determin- ing \\\"best\\\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess  used to determine the \\\"best\\\" is the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.  To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.  If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the only measure of \\\"best\\\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base- ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham- pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub- jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.   Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens. I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.   You don't have to be rude.   For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per- formance.  The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new knowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less  incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.  -- \",\"       Carlos,     Why not check out some of the scientific research that has been done in this area and convince yourself.

This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride    (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty,     fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).  Communication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler back every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled Magna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you  can't really communicate.  Balance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how they're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately and lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning thing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a pain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay perpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn and WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always screws up the line I've picked out.  Here's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:  - attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.  - Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not    get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount    in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)  - Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)  - We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many    first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)  - Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and    we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're    confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel    of it.  Or just hug me tight.    - Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be     gradual, so I can compensate.  - Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.  - Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right     thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how    to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to    stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to     watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84,     and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, \\\"SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED\\\"     I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with     the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.    Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the    instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her    experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to     trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)  Usually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes,  tires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers. Helps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.  Watch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little mudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will be nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones. It doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the  first trip!  Good luck -- have fun!\",\"Since the AT&T wiretap chip is scheduled to be distributed  internationally, allowing the U.S. government to spy on foreign  governments, companies and people as as well as to wiretap domestic  citizens, this is a world-wide issue.  Thus Distribution: world.    Why do we hackers care about the Clipper chip?  Do we give a shit about anybody's privacy accept our own?  And perhaps not even our own; are we so smart that we always know when we're talking to somebody who has a wiretap on their phone?

An Armenian National Council  was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was  recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily  formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the  principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the  Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination  of the Jews.

They don't answer their 800 number.  It's 800-821-9000. \",\"   Well, let me see.  UZI, no.  M-11/9, no.  M-16/AR-15, maybe.  I remember there being a selector swtich on the AR-15.  If I remember correctly (please correct me if I'm wrong) the switch would set to an \\\"off\\\" position or an \\\"on\\\" position because the gun (AR-15) is semi-automatic.  Wouldn't the M-16 have a position for semi-auto fire and full-auto fire (or maybe 3 round bursts)?  If this is correct wouldn't it be easy to distinguish each gun by this alone?  Of course if the AR-15 were modified to full-auto fire I wouldn't think it would be that easy but I'm talking about distinguishing between an unmodified AR-15 and M-16. How about the other guns?  Do they also have selector switch to switch between semi-auto and fully-auto fire?     Actually it was pretty hard for the kids in my neighborhood to figure that out as Richard Petty lived in my neighborhood and left his stock car in the  driveway. ;-)    Well, what about what I said above?  If that is correct I guess TV would be acceptable (if you had a good enough picture and a picture of the lower  receiver of the AR-15/M-16).\",\" Steve, take a look at what you are saying.

I do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards.  He does not have too much offensive capabilities, but he is an awesome defensively. Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:) I forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.   As far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who beat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.   I agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that Lankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make a perfect throw?   I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don't forget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/ Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant race when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I will never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading in the right direction.   One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds, but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the East), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they lose.  Maybe this is the year that they will go all the way.

I just read my first newspaper in a while and noticed an article on a 'messianic cult' leader named 'David Koresh'.  I'd like to know more about this and what is going on with them.  Please email me as I don't normally read this newsgroup.  Thanks. \",\" I attribute my success to several factors:  Very low fat.  Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me, I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.  Very little sugar or salt.  Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)  My \\\"clean your plate\\\" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last 10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch up, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.  I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry shortly, and eating won't be practical then).  I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to stores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car. I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes runs in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle.)  There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately, it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.  Obviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've done will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who did try it and didn't succeed.   I'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat. I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty, my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes off again over a week or two. --  Keith Lynch, kfl@access.digex.com\",\"I need to port several OS/2 PM applications to X (OpenWindows or Motif), and desperately need any information on how to go about doing this (short of a complete rewrite.

Pre-game comments ----------------- Don's pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... The goalie who gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series for his team.  Eposode Summary --------------- This episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that he bought from the concession stand.  Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the Toronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow and proclaimed \\\"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks of me. Beauty.\\\"  Next, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to him, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all the arenas in the NHL.  From there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game had great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game in the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All stop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary by Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most penalties gets to ref in the finals.  Next, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for the Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the wins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup and the AHL championships.  Finally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the Rangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved. Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had several key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who went cold.  Don had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party's over, Adolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer be a 'country club'.... \\\"NY should be achamed of themselves... If they go in the tank with Adolf there, they'll be hanging from the yardarm by their thumbs.\\\"   Rating ------ Nothing too special in this episode.

An On/Off Road Rally consists of the following:     1. An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of       directions and clues guiding participates around the        Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course       based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will       be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which       they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the       number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately        lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is        set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points       will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions       or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,       basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.     2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants       will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.       Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles       without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half       the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle       unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will       divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified       4x4s can run the course.         At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring   participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.   Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.  * This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles   so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be   street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section   of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper   from their vehicle :) .

The trap is the easy way out.  For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race, and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors leading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than not, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.  If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few Blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable or whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to define \\\"us\\\" and \\\"other\\\" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational humans.  It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the *most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial makeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in San Francisco, a city that loves to tout its \\\"ethnic diversity\\\". Here, we have Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the \\\"model minority\\\") gangs, and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and crime are what they most fear. During the \\\"disturbance\\\" in Los Angeles last year many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I remember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned from TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives that live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly multi-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black* riot!  In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points that really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem becomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly believe that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current course of denial and repression.  I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors, luck in avoiding the \\\"trap\\\".

Several sets I've looked at use a 135 volt regulator.  The regulators have a tendency to short out, making the safety circuits shut down the EHT supply section.  Try putting the set on a Variac or adjustable transformer and lower the AC input voltage to the set to about 90 volts.  If the set operates nromally, then you know you've got a shorted regulator.

On 14\\\" Sony tubes, you'll find one wire.  Their level of annoyance is purely subjective.  I'm so happy with the sharpness of the T560i that I don't even notice the lines.  The T560i uses a Trinitron SA tube which, when viewed as a complete tube, has a larger diameter than the standard Trinitron tube.  This results in  a flatter screen than other 17\\\" monitors using the standard trinitron  (which has a vertically flat but not horizontally flat surface), and  apparently the ability to provide a tighter beam focus.   \",\"First of all let's assume that you are right that fewer guns would make it  in to the country, that sounds great (to those that see guns as inherently evil) except then every one  of those guns would be in the hands  of someone who obviously couldn't care less about following the law, after all they  got the gun illegally, so is more likely to commit a crime with that gun. Great then everyone with a gun is likely to use it in a crime, nice system.  Now  as to reducing the number of guns  coming into society by making it  illegal to manufacture, sell, or import them in this coutry,  let me use a parallel for empiric evidence.  The amount of cocaine in this country is far less since its manufacture, sale, and importation was out lawwed.    If that last statement is true then perhaps we should consider your plan.  This  could also apply to drugs in general.\",\"Detroit is a very disciplined team.

I would suggest that you take your code, and submit it to comp.sys.mac.binaries to be distributed (including to the ftp sites).  Many folks, myself included, would enjoy the extra code.   Just to clarify, the 3D routines that are mentioned in various places on the mac are in a libray, not the ROM of the mac.  A few years ago before I knew anything about implementing graphics, I came across a demo of the Apple GrafSys3D library and it actually did a lot.  However, it is quite limited in the sense that it's a low-level 3D library; your code still has to plot individual points, draw each line, etc ad nauseum.  It has nothing on GL, for example, where you can handle objects.  Other things to consider when talking about Apple's old 3D GrafSys library:  * Unsupported;  never was and no plans exist to do so in the future  * Undocumented; unless you call header files documentation...  If one knows something about graphics, you could probably figure it out, but I'd assume there's better software available that gives better output and is, at the same time, programmatically nicer (i.e. easier to program).  Just my 2% tax\",\"Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card  Several problems:  1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB    of VRAM, which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED    with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K    colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB    VRAM.  2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:     a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an       Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often       remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to       be.     b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the       display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you       shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).  3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development    Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger    icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the    debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed    to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The    Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.     Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen    is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter    \\\"R\\\". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it    does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this.     The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive    behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with    Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles    the VGA mode.        The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use    another monitor in place of my usual one.  I still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty). \",\"Clinton has backed off from the $16 billion jobs bill.

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to have a \\\"dirty\\\" amp.     Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs  Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.     for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt    radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet     away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.    If you experience the problem frequently, it may be     caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station    nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio     transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,    etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are    correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.     If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite    chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably    being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can    be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).    Good instructions are included with the chokes.    If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your    neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof    or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things    a radio operator can do to reduce interference.  And please remember to be friendly when approaching your local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the  cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b. interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.    BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it. Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers to take any precautions.  Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more than 10).  So if you hear \\\"This is WA1QT\\\" or some other call starting with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham. CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required to) and fire/police have other private ids.      \",\"It is not true that dermatologists gave not reached the laser age, in fact, lasers in dermatological surgery is a very new and exciting field.

Nazi Armenians were of service  to Germans in Arab countries as well. As Uzun put it, one well-known  case which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian  agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes. The mission  of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and  to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied  forces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda  efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among  the French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was the center of international Armenian terrorism.

The 27th was a short day at work, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24 Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the  car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit, and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and  her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to  45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?  When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was,  but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the  Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle around it. I ask, \\\"What's going on?\\\" Someone tells me, \\\"Come listen.\\\" Well they were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \\\"Brother Muslims, our time has come . . . \\\" and something else along that line. I didn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to  get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter.  New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And the comments started: \\\"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"There's no need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\\\" I even heard that: \\\"All  Moscow is behind us.\\\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this  was no joke. I quietly left and went home.  Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh,  that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of  things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.  My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku.  I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and  shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly, like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a  demonstration and move slowly.  My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd people are shouting \\\"Down with the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"Death to the Armenians!\\\" I waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street  on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned  and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26  Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there  was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same  kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside  from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.  My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of uneasy and said, \\\"No, let's stay at home instead.\\\" An hour went by, or maybe  an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.  I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside, and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time  there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more  aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration. They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run  again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I  followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was  leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one  side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square  and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There  was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals. I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \\\"We don't need  perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\\\" Now what did they  mean by \\\"living like we have been?\\\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else.  But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense  of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just  in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it  anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.  Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians'  apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't  hear them say \\\"kill them\\\" over the microphone, I only heard \\\"beat them and  drive them out.\\\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and  I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB. There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try  to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.  Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no demonstration, and I had to protect my family.  I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next to the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai- lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some- thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City  Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I  saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the  cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15  to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried  off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe  about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha.  When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was  about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He  has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I  have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of  people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled  around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.  Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting.  I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am,  I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags.  And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the  street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag,  which had \\\"Ermeni oryum\\\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \\\"Death to  Armenians!\\\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really know what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is Rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark blue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His  family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on  Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars;  their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the  left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a  new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son  was carrying a flag that said \\\"Death to Armenians!\\\" I was surprised because  before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being  done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.  Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \\\"It's OK, it'll pass,  they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up.\\\" Naturally I didn't  want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And  this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't  see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't  handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking  and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and  hashish to put in a store window!  So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one  would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again,  the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't  breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time.  True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much- vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people  died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I  couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be  specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of  Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.  When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \\\"Let's go upstairs.\\\"  We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the  evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more. I stopped at \\\"The Corner,\\\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I  look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to  the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old.  The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed  toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person,  wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as  though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more  noise, and the glass was flying again.  We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor, there was really no way to defend yourself there.  In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town.  On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or  what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the  bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying  there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing you couldn't even see him.  That was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.

Do an intersection calculation in the plane in 2D, where you're guaranteed a unique solution (unless they're parallel which won't happen in this case), and then use parametric distance along the lines from the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest.  This bypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in 3d.  Hope I haven't put my foot in it again!  steve ---\",\"Finally got my computer fixed and I'd like to sum up.  About hard drive companies: the original 160 meg drive that was bad (bad sector or something) was an IBM.  The new one is a Quantum.  Is the LCIII supposed to be shipped with IBMs?  Is there a quality difference?  Apparently! :)  Second, about hard drive position.  I've put the LCIII on its side and the new 160 HD has had no problems at all.

Mitra is Sanskrit for Friend, as such He started out as an avatar of Lord Visnu  mentioned first in the Vedas. Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence  worshipped by the Persians. Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun, he is  the lord of contract honor and obedience, therefore naturally worshipped by  soldiers. He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct-  antly agreed because of His obligation...the blood of that bull spilled and  grew all earth life...then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat.  Worship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians.  Hundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman  Pantheon (tm) for some semi-tricky reason, I forget why. But all references of  Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same, so apparently His worship  was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy, like membership  in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc. The sociology of religion in  ancient times is fascinating!  Oh, His B-day was 25 Dec. Ahem.  I am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the  Roman Imperial God Roster or what. It contained mostly soldiers, with 7 levels  of initiation. They worshipped underground in caverns in pews. The bull horns  in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits, I'm not sure  that they had Mithraic significance or not.  I don't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the  Christian masses. But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt.  Someone mentioned bullfighting. Did Mithraists sacrifice bulls? I forget. More  likely, for a religious source, might be the shower of bull's blood enjoyed  by the worshippers of Cybele on the Day of Blood? Cybele worship extended all  throughout even up to France bigtime.\",\"I saw his bike parked in front of a bar a few weeks later without the dog, and I wandered in to find out what had happened.

I'll continue to re-post periodically until *** he answers them, publicly indicates that he won't answer them, *** stops posting to alt.atheism, the alt.atheism community tells *** me to stop, or I get totally bored.  I apologize for the  *** somewhat juvenile nature of this approach, but I'm at a loss *** to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and  *** seeming intellectual dishonesty. *** *** This is re-post #3.   Charley,  I can't help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous posts.  I submit that you don't answer them because you cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once again challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for you as possible, I'll present concise re-statements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see.  Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I will re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at such time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this newsgroup.  I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be kind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it from this list.  Now, to the questions...  1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating that you weren't referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some atheists who you feel don't fit your patterns, to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your stereotype?  Here is the context for the question:    2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that \\\"senses and reason are all we have to go by\\\", and when pressed, you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...   then later...   then later...    3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by a.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify one such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical?  If so, please repeat them.  Here is the context for the question:    then later...    4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the \\\"axioms\\\" of reason that one couldn't help but become atheist.  I asked you to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that I have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer the question.  Please do so now.  Question: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that effect?  If you don't retract that claim, do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism?  Here is the context for the question:  [First quote] [Second quote]   5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these Challenges because they contained too much in the way of \\\"included text\\\" from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn't respond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify this seeming contradiction.  Question:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context from your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to avoid \\\"included text\\\"?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...    As usual, your responses are awaited with anticipation.  --Dave Wood   p.s., For the record, below is a compilation of Charley's responses to these challenges to date.  3/18/93  3/31/93 (#1)  3/31/93 (#2)\",\" Well Sweden and Australia, and lord knows wherever else used to drive on the \\\"wrong\\\" side of the road, so the export market might have been larger then than just the UK.   By the 1920s, there was a very active \\\"good roads\\\" movement, which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so, and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco \\\"America on the Road\\\" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called \\\"The Devil Wagon in God's Country\\\" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or John Bell Rae's auto histories.  As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I don't know why.

Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:  John Sorenson Carol Sigelman Carla Moore Barbara Moose Judith Schrier  Again, thank you to all who gave!  I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to  review the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.   It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett  Packard Scanners.    When initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options;  (1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3)  automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image.   I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which  parts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.  Once an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The  software gives you two \\\"errors\\\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were  converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.   Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted  correctly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more  credit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue,  you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal  dictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited,  considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary.   After a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word  processor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a  seperate TIFF or PCX file format.  I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  an Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.   While most of my faxes were received in \\\"standard\\\" mode (200x100 dpi), the  accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent.   Overall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the  limitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just  too small.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has  been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g.,  Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus,  Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences  of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera,  malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore,  control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug  resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease,  salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging  infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those  in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and  minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of  emerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more  effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs  (3).       This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \\\"Emerging Infectious  Diseases.\\\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as  surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and  public health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation  of an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4).   References  1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that  identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from  one restaurant chain. Washington       On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of  Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an  increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a  case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or  postdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls  implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset  (matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January  18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants  was initiated.       As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January- February 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the  state health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case  definition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS  (Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with  confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of  symptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A  restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients  who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating  a regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17  through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30  developed HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years  (range: 0-74 years). Idaho       Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health,  Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture- confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December  11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were  hospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13  (93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California       In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was  notified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died.  Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with  E. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993.  Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was  reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27%  increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January  1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as  postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured,  or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with  onset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993.       Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The  outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen  persons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median  age of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of  the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community  controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched  OR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients  who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular- sized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3).  Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada       On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten  at a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District  issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea  contact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody  diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness  with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with  onset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local  laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools  for E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After  SMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of  one patient 38 days after illness onset.       Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine  were hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range:  0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex- matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during  the week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence  limit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients  also implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7- 49.8). Other Investigation Findings       During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases  primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November  19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \\\"jumbo\\\" patties produced on  November 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11  lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed  to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672  (20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall.       A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the  United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing  the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter  plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one  slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.       Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in  families and child day care settings is ongoing.

Editorial Note: E. coli O157:H7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first  identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody  diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). This pathogen has since  emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common  cause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked  most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other  food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been  implicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter  study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7  that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10  participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a  higher rate than for any other pathogen.       Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most  clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  SMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses  associated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea  (often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups  and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and  complications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients  develop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,  renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%.       This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community  outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite  the magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in  three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington  (1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from  persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5).  When infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported  to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public  health action to prevent further cases.       E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can  contaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S.  Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify  critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce  the likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply.  Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with  pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens  from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be  internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook  ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices  are clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played  an important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim  recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to  155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993).       Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report  and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be  consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of  outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of  this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections  caused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E.  coli O157:H7.

Long-term use of  smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of  oral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who  currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1).  To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products,  CDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease  Prevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing  tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian,  noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This  report summarizes findings from this survey.       The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \\\"Have you used snuff at least 20  times in your entire life?\\\" and \\\"Do you use snuff now?\\\" Similar questions were  asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of  smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco  use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the  time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having  used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the  time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and  former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at  least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as  those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not  smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on  smokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or  equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide  national estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using  standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN)  (3).       In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users  of smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%)  women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco  use was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was  highest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was  highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan  Natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American  Indians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was  substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in  rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only  for women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1).       Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those  aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of  chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although  women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest  among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.       An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being  former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were  former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons  aged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users  (56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95%  CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users  was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5%  95% CI=68.9-78.1).       Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0)  currently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95%  CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95%  CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco.       Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3%  95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6- 49.6).   Reported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease  Prevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National  Center for Health Statistics, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless  tobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in  particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that  link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral  snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this  behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for  nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4).       Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among  racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels  and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require  further explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role  in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the  differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6).       In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current  smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the  prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco  users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous  study among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  occasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked  reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to  stop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health  implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use.       The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special  population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless  tobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year  2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more  than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the  prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless  tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts,  enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes  commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to  routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based  prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit  tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).

They have standard models, tactile models (with stainless domes under each key to make a 'click' you can feel), as well as backlit models.  Some of them can even be cut with scissors to form a funky shape other than a rectangle.

There are side effects, like withdrawal, but they effect people differently.     Stereotypical statement.  I know people who use heroin and opiates that  function just fine in society.     Name some of these drugs so we can debate about them more specifically.  [...]  NO, NO, NO.  (or at least I haven't been arguing this).  there is not enough data to form a scientific conclusion.  that _doesn't_ mean that cannabis is benign to users' lungs.  we can form all the theories we want, but they are only theories.  some theories are supported by more evidence than others, and that makes them stronger.     the hell I can't!  they state *UN-JUSTIFIED CONCLUSIONS* *AS FACT* as a *POLITICAL* strategy to stop drug use.

But the city's cable channel (35 in CableVision areas) shows this information map during travel times (6-9am and 4-7pm, I believe).  Most of the major LA freeways are covered.

We're just trying to eliminate all the \\\"easy\\\" explanations  for why you're not seeing your graphics.

What happens is that the inside of my throat starts to feel \\\"puffy\\\", like I have a cold, and also at times the inside of my mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy.  The situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants (usually chinese), the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast food chain, a japanese steak house (I had the steak), and another chinese fast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.  I am under the impression that MSG \\\"enhances\\\" flavor by causing the taste buds to swell.  If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonable to assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.  Also, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above) involved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this is what I suspect as being the cause.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animals showed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a lab rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.  Anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are totally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied they know of.  I will probably respond to them however with a reminder of how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer (which the tobacco companies still deny).  - DM  (If I sound grumpy, it's because I had beef with broccoli for lunch today, and now it hurts to swallow)  -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Dan Myers (Madman)  | If the creator had intended us to walk  myers@usceast.cs.scarolina.edu | upright, he wouldn't have given us knuckles\",\"  This brings up an interesting subject that has not been discussed much, and probably has not been studied much.  As some of you may be aware, I've posted a lot of articles lately on personality typing (of which the MBTI is a test vehicle).  To come up to speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for by personality type summary file.  One observation is that people have significantly different personalities (no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect to church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while other people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more solitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if confronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of people.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.  My impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and create environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted (there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am quite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches to participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very uncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly influenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing. (BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both preferences have their place in the Body).  Maybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words are usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert scale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is excerpted from my summary:  1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:          Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside                           world of people, activities or things.          Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal                           world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.   Hopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can structure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise the Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities to fit them into a particular framework.  I'm sure there are other aspects of how churches have not properly understood personality variances among their members to the detriment of all.

It  is updated each month and only information currently under discussion or  of continuing importance or interest will be listed for more than two  postings.    Boston Bruins   Boston legislators and the developers proposing a new Boston Garden  finally agreed to a deal that puts the 19,000-seat, $160 million project  back on track to be finished in September 1995.   Right wing Daniel Marois will be sidelined indefinitely following  surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back. **   Sent defenseman Glen Murray to Providence of the American Hockey League.   Buffalo Sabres 1-800-333-PUCK (1-800-333-7825)   Acquired left winger Bob Errey from Pittsburgh for defenseman Mike  Ramsey. **   Veteran Buffalo Sabres broadcaster Ted Darling will be inducted into the  club's Hall of Fame Sunday, April 11.  Darling, who joined the expansion  Sabres in 1970, was the team's play-by-play announcer on both television  and radio until illness forced him out of the booth during last season. **   Recalled forwards Viktor Gordiouk and Doug MacDonald from Rochester of  American Hockey League.   Calgary Flames   Acquired veteran right wing Greg Paslawski from Philadelphia for future  considerations. **   Recalled center Todd Harkins and left winger Tomas Forslund from Salt  Lake City of International Hockey League.   Chicago Blackhawks         The $175 million, privately financed United Center, scheduled to  open in August 1994, will be home to the NBA's Chicago Bulls and NHL's  Chicago Blackhawks. The stadium is owned by entities controlled by the two  teams. The owners apparently still have not made a decision on whether the  old Chicago Stadium will be razed for parking space once the new facility,  located directly across the street, opens.   Suspended defenseman Craig Muni indefinitely for failing to report  following a trade with Edmonton.   Detroit Red Wings   Acquired defenseman Steve Konroyd from Hartford for a sixth-round draft  pick.   Annnounced the signing of right wing Joe Frederick, their 13th pick in  the 1989 National Hockey League entry draft. **   Two contrite hockey fans have returned the stolen Michigan Sports Hall  of Fame plaque honoring Detroit Red Wing great Gordie Howe. The bronze  plaque was stolen more than four years ago from Cobo Hall in Detroit, site  of the Michigan Hall of Fame.   Edmonton Oilers   Sent forward Esa Tikkanen to the New York Rangers for center Doug  Weight.   Traded defenseman Craig Muni to Chicago for forward Mike Hudson.   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Edmonton Oilers' lease with  Northlands Coliseum must be improved if the team is to survive in the  city. Edmonton Northlands is a non-profit agency set up by the city to  administer exhibition facilities including the Coliseum.  Oilers owner  Peter Pocklington calls his lease with Northlands horrendous and has  threatened to move the team if he doesn't get a better deal. He makes no  money from parking, concessions or building advertising. The 17,313-seat  Coliseum also has few of the lucrative private boxes that produce  significant revenues for other owners.   Announced center Kevin Todd will not need surgery but will miss the  remainder of the season with a separated shoulder.   Hartford Whalers   Sent defenseman Steve Konroyd to Detroit for a sixth-round draft pick.   Acquired left winger Robert Kron and a third-round draft pick from  Vancouver for left winger Murray Craven and a fifth-round draft pick. **   The state of Connecticut will begin negotiations to buy the Civic Center  from the city in an effort to keep the financially struggling Hartford  Whalers franchise in the city.

Rheaume, the  first female to play professional hockey, stopped 25 shots and gave up six  goals against the Cincinnati Cyclones on Saturday night, April 10.

But  Esposito said there was no truth to the report.  \\\"We were disappointed  with ESPN's irresponsible comment,\\\" Esposito said.  \\\"There is just no  substance to the rumor.\\\" Rumors have been swirling for the past two years  regarding a move by Tampa Bay, which is presently discussing plans to  build a new arena.

All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except  matchups between Central and Pacific teams.  Those series will rotate 2-3- 2 to reduce travel.  In those cases, the team with the most regular-season  points will choose whether to start the series at home or away.  -----  - Draft news:          Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in  June, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one  goaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion  drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction  between forwards and defensemen.

San Jose, Tampa Bay and  Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.         Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of  one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is  that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.         At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises  will have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total  of 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa  Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two  new teams.         Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority  drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst  records. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The  expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose,  Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.         The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry  Draft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new  teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in  1994.          The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the  1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a  delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.  -----   - League news:  Disputes:    The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary  arbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

CHL: Fort Worth Fire, Wichita Thunder, Dallas Freeze, Tulsa Oilers, Memphis  River Kings, Oklahoma City Blazers    Six non-affiliated teams play a 60 game schedule extending from early  November to mid March. Each team is owned by the league, with local  interests controlling day to day operations. Each team has a $100,000  salary cap for 17 total players (16 dress up). Unlike the ECHL, players  are not limited to three years in the league.   A Western Division may be added to the Central Hockey League for the 93- 94 season if the plans of CHL president Ray Miron materialize.  Miron  confirmed that El Paso, Amarillo, Tuscon, and Albuquerque are cities under  consideration for the Western Division, which would play some interlocking  games with the Eastern Division.

Major League Hockey was founded by Roy Boe, former president of  the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League and the New York/New  Jersey Nets of the American and National Basketball associations.         According to Boe, the league will debut with six to eight teams  playing a schedule of approximately 80 games. Franchise applications have  been received from groups in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit,  Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, San Francisco, Saskatoon, Toronto  and Worcester, Mass., Boe said.         Although the league will not raid existing leagues to stock its  rosters, Boe said it will seek the ``world's finest hockey players.''         Boe said league play will have an international flair and  discussed implementing some rules which are reminiscent of those of the  IIHF.         ``We're removing the red line, moving the goal nets forward and  eliminating all tie games,'' said Boe.         The MLH office will operate out of Stamford, Conn.  -----   - British Premier Division:    contacts:   Neil A.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:    Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?  A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in  and around Montreal. Hence they were called \\\"Les Habitants\\\" (natives of  Montreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.    Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?  A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to  signify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer  existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.   Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?  A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is  a weekly journal with up-to-date info. Phone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US) Phone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)    Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in  the NHL?  A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1  chances.    Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?  A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when  a goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a  +, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short- handed goals do count for +/-.    Q: What is the five-hole?  A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones:  (1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower  right, and (5) five-hole.    Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?  A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven  series were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a  game, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.   Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?  A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever  to play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for  the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis  Blues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat  Expo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine  shots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately  lost the game, 6-4.   Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?  A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed  the richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be  worth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7  million a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.   Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?  A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National  Basketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey  League, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as  assistant general counsel. He became the league's chief legal officer in  September of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell  University in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.   Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?  A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and  Colonial Hockey Leagues.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------   9.

Some sites get another hockey group, called clari.sports.hockey. c.s.h  consists of the UPI feed for all UPI news articles that are related to  hockey, including game results, summaries, scores, standings, etc.  Much  of the information in the NHL team news section comes from this newsgroup.     The rec.sport.hockey Frequently Asked Questions posting is posted semi- monthly, usually on the 1st and 15th of each month, during the hockey  season.  This file was originally created by Tom Wilson, who posted it  during the 1991-92 season.  It was taken over by Mitch McGowan for the  1992-93 season.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------     Please make corrections via e-mail, indicating \\\"r.s.h FAQ\\\" as the  subject line.

Althouhg I have never seen stats on this subject, I am pretty    >sure that Jagr had more points per minute played that Francis.  When    >you add to that Jagr's better +/- rating, I think it becomes evident    >that Jagr had a better season- not that Francis had a bad one.    >       Actually, what I think has become more evident, is that you are determined to      flaunt your ignorance at all cost.  Jagr did not have a better season than      Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of      hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty      plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.       Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice      time per game and some measure of its \\\"quality\\\" (i.e., is the player put out      in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up      against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would      much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious      merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.  Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play.  In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get 90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.  (By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games). \",\"Has anyone got multiverse to work ?

What happens to a Russian, to a Czech, does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans, who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these human animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone comes to me and says, \\\"I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them\\\", then I would have to say, \\\"you are a murderer of your own blood because if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, and they are the sons of German mothers. They are our own blood\\\".    Extract from Himmler's address to party comrades, September 7 1940 [\\\"Trials of Wa Criminals\\\", Vol. IV, p. 1140] ------------------------------------------------------------------ If any Pole has any sexual dealing with a German woman, and by this I mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right in front of his camp. Then the others will not do it. Besides, provisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish women and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this kind is out of the question.  The women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp. This we must do, unless these one million Poles and those hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict untold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no avail in this case. It would be better if we did not have them at all - we all know that - but we need them.  \",\"    As far as I can see, one of the big differences between Davidians and Christians is in who they follow.  I have sometimes tried to put myself in the feet of one of Jesus's disciples.  Basically, they gave up a lot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to follow Jesus.  So what is the difference?  It is quite plain.  Jesus was good and David Koresh was not.  The problem is, I think, is that we try to legislate what is good and what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance, there are thousands of  laws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often, it is hard to bring people to justice, because it is not possible to find a legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just, then we could tell them to administer justice fairly, and justice would be followed.  But since judges don't always get it right, we have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches of other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect (the justice of man) into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justice system in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.  There is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation more than the material being presented.  So we might consider  a ranting Christian to be bad, but an eloquent person from another religion to be good.  This goes along with the American desire to protect the Constitution at all costs, even if it allows people to do bad things.   I think that it is the message that is important.  If a man is presenting a false message, even if he is ever ever so mild mannered, then that man is performing a tremendous disservice.  I know that I am rambling here.  I guess that what I am trying to say is that we shouldn't be looking for principles that tell us why the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow and worship a person.  But it is important to choose the right person. It is simple.  Choose Jesus, and you got it right.  Choose anyone else, and you got it wrong.  Why?  Because Jesus is the begotten son of God, and nobody else is.  Jesus was without sin, and nobody else was.\",\"From: pmetzger@snark.shearson.com (Perry E.

My 1975 Saab 99 didn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In addition to the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another set integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who don't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic growth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out of the front fender, which incorporated amber \\\"parking lights\\\", amber side marker lights/reflectors, white \\\"cornering lamps\\\" (like American luxury cars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators on, and white \\\"backup lights\\\" aimed towards the back of the car when you have selected reverse gear.

What he is saying is that the next step beyond what you propose is the permanent bugging of potential criminals.  This may not, on the surface, sound like a bad thing, but who defines what a potential criminal is? If the government of the day decides that being a member of an opposition party makes you a potential criminal then openly defying the government becomes a lethal practice, this is not conducive to a free society.  Mathew is saying that implanting electronic surveillance devices upon people is an impropriety upon that person, regardless of what type of crime or what chance of recidivism there is. Basically you see the criminal justice system as a punishment for the offender and possibly, therefore, a deterrant to future offenders. Mathew sees it, most probably, as a means of rehabilitation for the offender.

Nuclear weapons in and of themselves are dangerous.  Radioactive decay of plutonium and uranium, as well as the tritium in the weapon, tends to be somewhat dangerous to living things. (Can you say \\\"neutron flux\\\"?)  Plus these things have no self- defense purposes.  It's kinda hard to justify their use as a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use (low-yield weapons) or at worst for industrial target obliteration (translation:  cities and population centers).  Not to mention that for it to be used as a militia weapon and expect the user to live requires some sort of launch vehicle . . .\",\"Yesterday, I got the chance to hear Kurt Vonnegut speak at the University of New Hampshire. Vonnegut succeeded Isaac Asimov as the  (honorary?) head of the American Humanist Association. (Vonnegut is an atheist, and so was Asimov) Before Asimov's funeral, Vonnegut stood up and said about Asimov, \\\"He's in heaven now,\\\" which ignited uproarious  laughter in the room. (from the people he was speaking to around the time of the funeral)    \\\"It's the funniest thing I could have possibly said to a room full of humanists,\\\" Vonnegut said at yesterday's lecture.

(Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.) Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:  1) They don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is  still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the  load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground  return), so you still get ground and power line bounce.   2) They do help a lot with on-chip loads, as I had with the high load  on the clock lines.   3) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high  frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff  capacitors, since the RC time constant is too large.  What I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich,  but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent  diff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly  lines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probably  omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,  using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high  resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).  4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with  slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for  output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.  I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for  a MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I  needed.

My problem is,  I don't like xpr. It gives (at least, the X11R4 version does) louzy output: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me. Instead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, and lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel) image to black and white dots.  So: if you have a PostScript printer, try:  xwdtopnm <xwdfile> | # convert to PPM  [ppmtopgm |]  # .. to graylevel for smaller file to print  pnmtops -noturn | # .. to PostScript  lpr   # print  pnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care: If you want your image to be 4\\\" wide, use:  pnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4 -noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it  is high) -width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below) -scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a  width less than 4\\\", and will thus be printed smaller than 4\\\" wide.  If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4\\\", and  will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified  paper width.   In short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size,  but it will not blow it up automatically.  Hope this helps.

So, why should we judge religion without having experienced it?  People have said that religion is bad by any account, and that it is in no way useful, etc., but I don't totally agree with this.  Of course, we cannot really say how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion, but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it.  So basically, we can not judge whether religion is the right route for a given individual, or even for a general population.  We can say that it is not best for us personally (at least, you can choose not to use religion--might be hard to try to find out its benefits, as you state above).\",\"Hi!

Well, one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp chips.  Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the input of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to both chips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.    If you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an outboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good enough.  This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone and balance controls too).  If you take off from the center and ground legs of the volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably  before the other controls).

The NEC Adapter does not do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into the correct pinout but do not switch the Macs output into VGA mode.  Do I have to make one of these or does someone already have one made-up??  The following is the Apple spec for the LC cpu VGA Cable adapter. I'm assuming that the Powerbooks/Duos will work with the same adapter(?);   Macintosh LC to VGA   The Macintosh LC can supply a 640 x 480, VGA timed signal for use with VGA monitors by using an adapter cable.  The standard Macintosh LC supports VGA to 16 colors, and with the optional 512K VRAM SIMM, the VGA monitor is supported to 256 colors.   Note:     The Macintosh LC supplies signals capable of driving TTL level           inputs.  However, some low impedance input VGA monitors do not work           with the Macintosh LC.   To connect a Macintosh LC to a VGA monitor, you need to make an adapter cable from the Macintosh LC video connector to the VGA monitor.  Following is the pinout description for the adapter cable:   Macintosh LC        VGA Video Connector     Pin     Signal Name ---------------     ----    ----------- 1                   6       Red ground 2                   1       Red video signal 5                   2       Green video signal 6                   7       Green ground 9                   3       Blue video signal 13                  8       Blue ground 15                  13      /HSYNC 12                  14      /VSYNC 14                  10      HSYNC ground 7,10                nc      SENSE1 & SENSE2 tied together   VGA monitors are identified by shorting pin 7 to pin 10 on the Macintosh LC video connector.  The Macintosh LC grounds pin 7 on its video connector, which results in pulling down pin 10 and gives the correct monitor ID for a VGA monitor.\",\"I have a Sega Genesis (barely used) that IUd like to sell with the following games:  Sonic the Hedgehog (I) Revenge of Shinobi Thunderforce III  I'm asking $160 OBO.

It is clear that Mr. Wingate intends to continue to post tangential or unrelated articles while ingoring the Challenges themselves.  Between the last two re-postings of the Challenges, I noted perhaps a dozen or more posts by Mr. Wingate, none of which answered a single Challenge.    It seems unmistakable to me that Mr. Wingate hopes that the questions will just go away, and he is doing his level best to change the subject.  Given that this seems a rather common net.theist tactic, I would like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers, in the following manner:  1. Ignore any future articles by Mr. Wingate that do not address the Challenges, until he answers them or explictly announces that he refuses to do so.  --or--  2. If you must respond to one of his articles, include within it something similar to the following:      \\\"Please answer the questions posed to you in the Charley Challenges.\\\"  Really, I'm not looking to humiliate anyone here, I just want some honest answers.  You wouldn't think that honesty would be too much to ask from a devout Christian, would you?    Nevermind, that was a rhetorical question.\",\"The most current orbital elements from the NORAD two-line element sets are carried on the Celestial BBS, (513) 427-0674, and are updated daily (when possible).

As published in \\\"US Industrial Outlook 1993\\\"  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be \\\"adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.\\\"                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  \\\"Space Business Indicators\\\" in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year  through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request \\\"launch on demand\\\"  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/\\\"Spacelifter\\\" program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all \\\"ELV upgrade\\\" programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \\\"Spacelifter\\\"  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \\\"GO-AHEAD\\\"    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a \\\"Star Wars\\\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \\\"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\\\"     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst's report Morgan Stanley said \\\"We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.\\\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \\\"Aerokosmos\\\"  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \\\"Severkosmos\\\",  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one's a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \\\"the main  alternative rocket supplier\\\" for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of \\\"off the shelf\\\" components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the  satellite's communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \\\"Asiasat- 2\\\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based \\\"Asiasat\\\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's  aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \\\"made in Korea.\\\"   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

The difference now is that such strains have become virulent.  In the old days, such TB was weak.  It didn't spread to other people very easily and just infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance with medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains has been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9 drugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to such strains.  Now, however, with a virulent resistant strain, we are in more trouble, and measures to assure compliance may be necessary even if they entail force.  --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"From article <1993Apr15.024246.8076@Virginia.EDU>, by ejv2j@Virginia.EDU (\\\"Erik Velapoldi\\\"):\",\"Does anyone know what frequencies the wireless transmitter/receiver microphone systems that Radio Shack sells operate at?

I'm POSITIVE that the \\\"sealed warrant\\\" is not for child abuse.  What was it for?  Peobably weapons violations.  Janet Reno didn't say WORD ONE last night about weapons violations.  Why?

If gun control doesn't lower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue.   Does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much more common? Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the threat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim  in an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not be as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually _use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.) It isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a knife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more common. That's why it is important to look at the overall (not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of substitution, different criminal techinques of using different weapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.   \\\"Face\\\"? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn't too common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the usual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts to much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your pockets. Overall, I'd much rather be threatened with a gun than actually stabbed with a knife.   Actually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training in unarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman  without much problem.  You also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National Crime Survey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a knife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives in a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almost all prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore, using (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case) a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless of how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effective than guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a \\\"serious threat\\\" nearly as often as they do guns.\",\"This is an all-point team for the Canadian NHLers who are not playoff bound...

McLane is a businessman, and doesn't like excuses.  He makes a valid point that injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of the bench this season..

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.  Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise OED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument.  Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job.  Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \\\"It is raining\\\" or \\\"Today is Tuesday\\\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to be true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning of \\\"deny\\\", not the everyday meaning.  The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular arrangement of words used to express it.  So \\\"God exists\\\" and \\\"There exists a God\\\" both express the same proposition.  An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \\\"a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition\\\".  An argument consists of three stages.  First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions.   Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \\\"because\\\", \\\"since\\\", \\\"obviously\\\" and so on.  (The phrase \\\"obviously\\\" is often viewed with suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to question it.  You can always say \\\"Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious\\\" when you've heard the explanation.)  Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of valid inference.  The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \\\"implies that\\\" or \\\"therefore\\\".  Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as \\\"therefore\\\", \\\"it follows that\\\", \\\"we conclude\\\" and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.  For example:  Every event has a cause (premise) The universe has a beginning (premise) All beginnings involve an event (premise) This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference) Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)  Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.  Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example, the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated  afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if  sometimes a little confusing.  Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some statements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:  \\\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,  or the Son of God.\\\"  This is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its  conclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll come to those later.)  Another example:  \\\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\\\"  The phrase \\\"do your duty to God\\\" is not a proposition, since it is neither true nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an argument.  Finally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \\\"A because B\\\".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the statement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then it is not an argument, it is an explanation.  For example:  \\\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not  start.\\\" -- This is an argument.  \\\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\\\"  -- This is an explanation.  There are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions -- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion is true.  An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid; however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments, and about how probable their premises are.  There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.  It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly  counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more carefully.  Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions.  For example:     All insects have wings (premise)    Woodlice are insects (premise)    Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)  Here, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false.  If the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true.  The argument is thus entirely valid.  More subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises, as in:     All fish live in the sea (premise)    Dolphins are fish (premise)    Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)  However, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \\\"truth table\\\" for implication.  The symbol \\\"=>\\\" denotes implication; \\\"A\\\" is the premise, \\\"B\\\" the conclusion.  \\\"T\\\" and \\\"F\\\" represent true and false respectively.  Premise Conclusion Inference    A        B        A=>B ----------------------------    F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference    F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.     T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion                              false, the inference must be invalid.     T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,                              the conclusion must be true.  A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound  argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments.  To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.  In everyday English the term \\\"fallacy\\\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair enough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or convincing.  So for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive.  ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)  The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \\\"might makes right\\\".  The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.  For example: \\\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM  Argumentum ad hominem is literally \\\"argument directed at the man\\\".  The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.  For example: \\\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\\\"  Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by  showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not argumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's testimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).  The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent's particular circumstances.  For example: \\\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue otherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?\\\"  This is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent's argument.  This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For  example:  \\\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing.  You're white.\\\"  This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is also known as \\\"poisoning the well\\\".  ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM  Argumentum ad ignorantium means \\\"argument from ignorance\\\".  This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true, a basic scientific principle.)  Examples: \\\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\\\"  \\\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has shown any proof that they are real.\\\"  Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty.  Also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can  validly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:  \\\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water, even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no such flood occurred.\\\"  In science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred, however.  ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM  This is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is  committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a  conclusion accepted.  For example:  \\\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me guilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan.\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM  This is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language.  For example:  \\\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\\\"  \\\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM  This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more likely it is that that proposition is correct.  ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM  The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion.  For example:  \\\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\\\"  This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly between:  \\\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\\\" and \\\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent  computer\\\"  Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable  whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.  THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT  The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose \\\"accidental\\\" circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific.  For example:  \\\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must dislike atheists.\\\"  This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.  CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION  This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases.  For example: \\\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are insincere.\\\"  SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER  A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization.  NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  These are known as False Cause fallacies.  The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For  example:  \\\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God cured me of the headache.\\\"  The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For  example:  \\\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons.\\\"  CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.  PETITIO PRINCIPII  This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached.  CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO  This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:  \\\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job.  Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open to blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office.\\\"  Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the  conclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees.  Another example is the classic:  \\\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God.\\\"  COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION  This is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded  question:  \\\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\\\"  The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination, when they ask questions like:  \\\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\\\"  Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:  \\\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\\\" or \\\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\\\"  IGNORATIO ELENCHI  The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument  supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion.  For example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.  Sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light.  EQUIVOCATION  Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument.  For example:  \\\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\\\"  AMPHIBOLY  Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing.  ACCENT  Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case, the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized.  For example, consider:  \\\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\\\" and \\\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\\\"  FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION  One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole.  For example:  \\\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very  lightweight.\\\"  The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:  \\\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses.\\\"  FALLACY OF DIVISION  The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like its opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:  \\\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\\\"  The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item.  For example:  \\\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\\\"  THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT  This argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful events.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event.  For example: \\\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana.\\\"  \\\"A IS BASED ON B\\\" FALLACIES / \\\"IS A TYPE OF\\\" FALLACIES  These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.  Examples: \\\"Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of history?\\\"  \\\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a form of Christianity?\\\"  \\\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?\\\"  AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form \\\"A implies B, B is true, therefore A is true\\\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for implication given earlier.  DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form \\\"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\\\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy.  Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has the form \\\"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\\\", where A does NOT in fact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is invalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about B.  CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL  This fallacy is an argument of the form \\\"If A then B, therefore if B then A\\\".  ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM  This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old, or because \\\"that's the way it's always been.\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM  This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else.  ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM  The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those with more money are more likely to be right.  ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM  The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam.  ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM  This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard.  An \\\"argumentum ad nauseum\\\" is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something.  BIFURCATION  Also referred to as the \\\"black and white\\\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist.  PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS  This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question.  NON SEQUITUR  A non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it.  RED HERRING  This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the points being made, towards a different conclusion.  REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION  Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.  SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF  The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.  STRAW MAN  The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position, then to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made.  THE EXTENDED ANALOGY  The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two  different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a  claim that those situations are analogous to each other.  This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about  anti-cryptography legislation:  \\\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\\\"  \\\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported  Martin Luther King.\\\"  \\\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the  struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\\\"  TU QUOQUE  This is the famous \\\"you too\\\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:  \\\"You're just being randomly abusive.\\\" \\\"So?  You've been abusive too.\\\"\",\"<< < For example: why does the universe exist at all?    <Whether there is a \\\"why\\\" or not we have to find it. This is Pascal's(?) wager. <If there is no why and we spend our lives searching, then we have merely <wasted our lives, which were meaningless anyway. If there is a why and we .. <Suppose the universe is 5 billion years old, and suppose it lasts another <5 billion years. Suppose I live to be 100. That is nothing, that is so small <that it is scary. So by searching for the \\\"why\\\" along with my friends here <on earth if nothing else we aren't so scared.   I find this view of Christianity to be quite disheartening and sad. The idea that life only has meaning or importance if there is a Creator does not seem like much of a basis for belief.   And the logic is also appalling: \\\"God must exist because I want Him to.\\\"   I have heard this line of \\\"reasoning\\\" before and wonder how prevalent it is. Certainly in modern society many people are convinced life is hopeless (or so the pollsters and newscasts state), but I don't see where this is a good reason to become religious. If you want 'meaning' why not just join a cult, such as in Waco? The leaders will give you the security blanket you desire.\",\" Mel is alive and well and playing in Japan.

Come on, Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant. Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders.   YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**. Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.  But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel doesn't have a game like that in him.   Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about Roussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah, Dom has played well too.   FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a team picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the same picture they sold in the programs in mid-season.

I don't like that method since I've seen guards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they got their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies.\",\"To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota:    From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people  in the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St.  Paul \\\"Pioneer Press\\\" wrote an article giving the \\\"inside scoop\\\" on the  issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible  candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic  Center (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty  confident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will  ultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other  two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the  inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name)  believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also,  because of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed  until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.   However, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed,  because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for  conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to  this mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future  viability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even  further.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of  knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging  Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met,  which may happen.  Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are  Hartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \\\" Ice Demons?\\\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't  been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the  Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in  as many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see  Hartford and Tampa show up there either. So, Minnesota may end up  getting another team, but it may take a few years.

What  was he killed for. He hadn't hurt anyone, hadn't said any word he oughtn't  have. Why did they kill him? I want to find out--from here, from there, from  the government--why my husband was killed.  On the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home. He doesn't work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, \\\"Mamma, is  there a soccer game?\\\" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That's where we  lived. I say, \\\"I don't know, Igor, I haven't turned on the TV.\\\" He looked  again and said, \\\"Mamma, what's going on in the courtyard?!\\\" I look and see so  many people, it's awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands,  you can't even tell how many there are. They're shouting, \\\"Down with the  Armenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!\\\" My God, why is  that happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together well, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely  unexpected. And they were shouting, \\\"Long live Turkey!\\\" And they had flags, and they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he's  around 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I  can't make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something, and the children behind him are shouting, \\\"Tear the Armenians to pieces!\\\" and  \\\"Down with the Armenians!\\\" They shout it again, and then shout, \\\"Hurrah!\\\" The  people streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I  saw that there were women, too. I say, \\\"My God, there are women there too!\\\"  And my son says, \\\"Those aren't women, Mamma, those are bad women.\\\" Well we  didn't look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I  simply couldn't sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani  neighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \\\"Khalida, what's going on, what  happened?\\\" She says, \\\"Emma, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what  happened.\\\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks,  each second or third one had a white rod. They're waving the rods above their  heads as they walk, and the one who's out front, like a leader, he has a white stick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I  don't know.  My husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \\\"Oh  dear, I'm frightened, they're going to kill us I bet.\\\" And he says, \\\"What are  you afraid of, they're just children.\\\" I say, \\\"Everything that happens comes  from children.\\\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and  Vocational School. \\\"Don't fear,\\\" he said, \\\"it's nothing, nothing all that  bad.\\\" He didn't eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they broadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran.  When I heard that I couldn't settle down at all, I kept walking here and  there and I said, \\\"They're going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to  kill us.\\\" And he says, \\\"Don't be afraid.\\\" Then we heard--from the central  square, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shouting different things, and you couldn't hear every well. I say, \\\"You speak Azerbaijani well, listen to what they're saying.\\\" He says \\\"Close the window and go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\\\" He listened a bit and then  closed the window and went to bed, and told us, \\\"Come on, go to sleep, it's nothing.\\\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window until two in the morning watching. Well he's sick, and all of this was affecting him. I say, \\\"Igor, you go to bed, I'm going to go to bed in a minute too.\\\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed.  Things had calmed down slightly.  The 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \\\"Come on, Emma,  get up.\\\" I say, \\\"Today's my day off, let me rest.\\\" He says, \\\"Aren't you going  to make me some tea?\\\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \\\"Where are  you going?\\\" He says, \\\"I'm going out, I have to.\\\" I say, \\\"Can you really go  outside on a day like today? Don't go out, for God's sake. You never listen to me, I know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take  the car out of the garage, go without the car.\\\" And he says, \\\"Come on, close  the door!\\\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn't make it out, he probably said \\\"coward\\\" or something.  I closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up around the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after- noon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said, \\\"Khalida, was it our car?\\\" She says, \\\"No, no, Emma, don't be afraid, they were government cars and Zhigulis.'' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited, it was four o'clock, five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven I said, \\\"Oh, they've killed Shagen!\\\"  Tires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and I'm afraid, I'm  standing on the balcony and I'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God,  they've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten  o'clock and he still hadn't come home. And I'm afraid to go out. At ten o'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore, and from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside.  I'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I  don't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see  it. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \\\"Mamma,\\\" he says, \\\"look what they're doing over there!\\\" They were burning everything, and there  were police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing  on the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are  throwing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony  is shouting, \\\"What are you standing there for, burn it!\\\" When they threw the  television, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out  on her balcony and shouted, \\\"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those things, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their  home. Why are you burning them?\\\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \\\"Go  inside, go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in  your building or not?\\\" They meant Armenians, but they didn't say Armenians,  they said, \\\"of them.\\\" She says, \\\"No, no, no, none!\\\" Then she ran downstairs to our place, and says, \\\"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\\\" I say, \\\"They've killed Shagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won't be living for me without  Shagen. Let them kill us, too!\\\" She insists, saying, \\\"Emma, get out of here,  go to Khalida's, and give me the key. When they come I'll say that it's my  daughter's apartment, that they're off visiting someone.\\\" I gave her the key  and went to the neighbor's, but I couldn't endure it. I say, \\\"Igor, you stay  here, I'm going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa's . . . Papa's there.\\\"  Meanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and  Valery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in  the courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling,  and I didn't think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived in the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw an Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \\\"Madar,  Uncle Shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the  garage, let's at least bring the corpse into the house. \\\"He shouts, \\\"Aunt  Emma, where do you think you're going?! Go back into the house, I'll look for  him.\\\" I say, \\\"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar,  I'm coming too.\\\" Well he wouldn't let me go all the same, he says, \\\"You stay  here with us, I'm go look.\\\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \\\"Aunt  Emma, there's no one there, the garage is closed. \\\"Madar went off again and  then returned and said, \\\"Aunt Emma, they're already killed Alik, and Valery's  there . . . wheezing.\\\"  Madar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \\\"Don't go near him,  or we'll put you next to him.\\\" He got scared--he's young--and came back and  said, \\\"I'm going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take  Alik, maybe he'll live . . . \\\" They grew up together in our courtyard, they  knew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but not a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and  called, and called, and called--nothing.  I went upstairs to the neighbor's. Igor says, \\\"Two police cars drove up over  there, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still  lying where they were, they're still lying there . . . \\\"We watched out the window until four o'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn't take my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six o'clock in the morning I got up and said, \\\"Igor, you stay here at home, don't go out, don't go anywhere, I'm going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or alive . . . let me go . . . I've got the keys from work.\\\"  At six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another  doctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \\\"Doctor, is  Shagen there?\\\" He says, \\\"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\\\" I  wanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. There were only four people in there, they said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. They said, \\\"Shagen's not here, he's alive somewhere, he'll come back.\\\"  It's already seven o'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck with three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with them. I say, \\\"Sara Baji [\\\"Sister\\\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they've probably brought Shagen.\\\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back and says, \\\"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it's a younger person.\\\" Now Shagen  just happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they  said it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \\\"Doctor, they've  brought Shagen in dead.\\\" He says, \\\"Why are you carrying on like that, dead,  dead . . . he's alive.\\\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back  the look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They knew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \\\"Doctor,  is it Shagen?\\\" He says, \\\"No, Emma, it's not he, it's somebody else entirely.\\\"  I say, \\\"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I'll find out all the same anyway,  if not today, then tomorrow.\\\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the office. He says, \\\"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\\\" Another one of our  colleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous  condition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't Shagen. A few minutes  later another colleague comes in and says, \\\"Oh, poor Emma!\\\" When she said it  like that there was no hope left.     That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured  people.  At night someone took me home. I said, \\\"Igor, Papa's been killed.\\\"  On the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital:  I had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is  surrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \\\"Hey, citizen, where  are you going?\\\" I say, \\\"I work here,\\\" and from inside someone shouts, \\\"Yes,  yes, that's our cook, let her in.\\\" I went right to the head doctor's office and there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to work with us at the hospital. He says, \\\"Emma, Shagen's been taken to Baku. In the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\\\" I say, \\\"Doctor, how will I bury him?\\\" He says, \\\"We're taking care of all that, don't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. Where did you spend the night?\\\" I say, \\\"I was at home.\\\" He says, \\\"What do you mean you were at home?! You were at home alone?\\\" I say, \\\"No, Igor was there too.\\\" He says, \\\"You can't stay home, we're getting an ambulance right now, wait just one second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance right now, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here like a patient, and you'll stay here and we'll se~ later what to do next ...\\\" His last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor's name is Izyat Jamalogli Sadukhov.  The \\\"ambulance\\\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a  patient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the  hospital until the 4th.  Some police car came and they said, \\\"Emma, let's go.\\\" And the women, our  colleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \\\"Where are  you taking her?\\\" I say, \\\"They're going to kill me, too . . . \\\" And the investigator says, \\\"Why are you saying that, we're going to make a positive identification.\\\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I still can't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \\\"Let's  go, we need to be certain, maybe it's not Shagen.\\\" And when I saw the caskets, lying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \\\"I can't look, no.\\\" The investigator says, \\\"Are there any identifying marks?\\\" I say, \\\"Let me see the clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I'll recognize them.\\\" He says,  \\\"Isn't they're anything on his body?\\\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his  finger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had been injured at work . . .  They brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they  brought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \\\"Oh,  they burned him!\\\" I shouted, I don't know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat  down, I don't remember. And that investigator says, \\\"Well fine, fine, since  we've identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since he has seven gold teeth . . . \\\"  On the 4th they told me: \\\"Emma, it's time to bury Shagen now.\\\" I cried, \\\"How,  how can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he's sick? I should inform  his relatives, he has three sisters, I can't do it by myself.\\\" They say, \\\"OK,  you know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they  get here from Yerevan? There's no transportation, it s impossible.\\\"  He was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in  Sumgait. They asked me, \\\"Where do you want to bury him?\\\" I said, \\\"I want to  bury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\\\" I'm  shouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \\\"Do you know what  it means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\\\" I say, \\\"What do you mean,  arson? Don't they know what's going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that they killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don't have anyone  anymore.\\\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He says, \\\"Let's bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year,  if it calms down, I'll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \\\"  Our trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the investigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then at the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime.  Then they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said,  \\\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\\\" He says, \\\"Yes.\\\" \\\"Well look, here you're  describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\\\" He says,  \\\"Yes.\\\" \\\"And now you're telling it differently?\\\" He says, \\\"Well maybe I  forgot!\\\" Like that.  The witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going along Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a  Volga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were  involved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it's unclear who--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side of the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports  jacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \\\"What's your nationality?\\\" He  says, \\\"Armenian.\\\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \\\"If he's an Armenian, kill him, kill him!\\\" They started beating him, they broke seven of his ribs, and his heart . . . I don't know, they did something there, too  . . . it's too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he  had an armature shaft. He says, \\\"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush,  that's where I got it.\\\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he had already had it. He said, \\\"I hit him twice,\\\" he said, \\\" . . . once or twice on the head with that rod.\\\" And he said that when he started to beat him  Shagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said,  \\\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment, killing someone,\\\" he says, \\\"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or not?\\\" I said, \\\"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you came back to hit him again?\\\" He went back and looked and he was already dead. \\\"After that,\\\" that bastard Tale said, \\\"after that I went home.\\\"  I said, \\\"You . . . you . . . little snake,\\\" I said, \\\"Are you a thief and a  murderer?\\\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They were taken. He says he didn't take them  When they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was other people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned it, that hasn't been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \\\"How can you  have the trial when you don't know who burned the car?\\\" He said something, but I didn't get what he was saying. But I said, \\\"You still haven't straightened  everything out, I think that's unjust.\\\"  When they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him.  In the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80 percent of his body . . .  And I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good  craftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his  own hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the  time. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the  Army. And now they're fatherless...  I couldn't sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15 years' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn't know what to do with myself, I said, \\\"How can that be? You,\\\" I said, \\\"you are  saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years'  deprivation of freedom?\\\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \\\"Let me at that creep, with my bare hands I'll . . . \\\" A relative restrained me, and there were all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,\\\" This isn't a  Soviet trial, this is unjust!\\\" That's what I shouted, l said it and left . . .  I said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street,  they were shouting, \\\"Long live Turkey!\\\" and \\\"Glory to Turkey!\\\" And during the  trial I said to that Ismailov, \\\"What does that mean, 'Glory to Turkey'?\\\" I  still don't understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet  Union. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still don't understand why \\\"Glory to Turkey!\\\" I asked that question twice and got no answer . . . No one answered me . . .

Hope you like it.      Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti        Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti,     the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven. She was a cheerful     girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but     one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.      The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on     the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-     nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally     arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and     give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon     on the  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love     we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to     die rather than commit a mortal sin.      Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy     Eucharist. Her  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father's     absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the rest  of  the     day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is     until         -4-            her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.     Thus ended the happiest day of Maria's life.      Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling     little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her     mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband, Maria     took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.     She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the     Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti's, owning     a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other     children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she     did the Holy Will of God.      During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son) twice     made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On     both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro's     strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she     even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria lived     in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.       On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  \\\"get  a     handkerchief,\\\"  as he  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath     the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the     baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered     what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a     91/2\\\"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told     him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He     stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia     instantly realized what he was up to. \\\"No, No, No! Do  not touch     me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!\\\" At this point Alessandro     held the knife over Maria's chest, who was now on the floor.      \\\"Will you or will you not?\\\" Maria gathered all her energy. \\\"No I     will  not, Alessandro,  no!\\\"   She had chosen her martyrdom over     sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the     knife  into   Maria's  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to     his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the     knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying     of the baby Teresa on  the  landing  brought  the attention  to     Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended     and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find     Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.     When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   \\\"He     wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.\\\"      The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro away.     As the  ambulance carried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd     followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for     poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First     Communion         -5-            came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.     He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  \\\"Yes.  For the     love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me     in Paradise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have.\\\" Maria     died at about three o'clock.      Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria's  death  but     because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in     prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-     ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of     a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to     him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God's par-     don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony     in Maria's  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,     on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the     first mother ever to be present at her daughter's canonisation.      May St. Maria Goretti help us  to be  pure  and  grant  us  the     strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.

The SUNDAY TIMES 8 March 1992  Morgues fill as Azeris head for all-out war  -------------------------------------------  Thomas Goltz, the first to report the massacre by Armenian soldiers in  the worst violence since the breakup of the Soviet Union, reports from  Agdam  ------  Khojaly used to be a barren town, with empty shops and treeless dirt  roads. Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier  times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off  the map.  .......  As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of  Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt  that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been  the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke  apart.  .......  I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and  people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut Ezoya,  a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the  town, called her community \\\"sitting ducks, ready to get shot\\\". She and  her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.  .......  \\\"The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and  the government does nothing.\\\" Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,  said. \\\"Next they will drive us out or kill us all,\\\" said Dilbar, his  wife. The couple, their three sons and three daughters were killed in  the assault, as were many other people I had spoken to.  ......  \\\"It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have to cross.  There was a road, and the first units of the column ran across then  all hell broke loose. Bullets were raining down from all sides. we had  just entered their trap.\\\"  The azeri defenders picked off one by one. Survivors say that Armenian  forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything moved in  the gullies. A video taken by an azeri cameraman, wailing and crying  as he filmed body after body, showed a grizzly trail of death leading  towards higher, forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge  from the Armenians.  \\\"The Armenians just shot and shot and shot,\\\" said Omar Veyselov, lying  in hospital in Agdam with sharapnel wounds. \\\"I saw my wife and  daughter fall right by me.\\\"  People wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the  loved ones. Some vented their fury on foreigners: \\\" Where is my  daughter, where is my son ?\\\" wailed a mother. \\\"Raped. Butchered. Lost.\\\"  Azerbaijan has said as many as 1,000 refugees were killed as they  tried to flee. The Armenians have denied this, saying the civilians  were caught in \\\"crossfire\\\".  .......  Source: The Times, 2 March 1992.  CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH  ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO  INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...  As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw  the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as  they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to  journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts  of the hills.  The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING  of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians  last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death  or missing...   Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter  as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there  was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer  ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We  swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon  under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.  We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round  again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a  valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung  round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired  repeated blasts.  Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting  had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in  fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.  I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,  its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on  \\\"our side\\\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a  search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.  Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two  M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed  flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second  crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains  and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters  were there to give covering fire if necessary.  The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet  armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani  official told us that there were now five former Soviet military  helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \\\"They have  signed contracts to fly for us,\\\" he said. The helicopter we engaged  in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian  pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.  We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an  heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer  white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four  corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an  Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies  on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back  towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before  the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.  Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the  civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were  covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor  mortis. They had been shot.  What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,  and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY  DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that most people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail- order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily by law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep  them honest about acquiring parts.   For Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is a HUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily. Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are not as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the  plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy, then, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it on a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts, more traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.  Mike\",\"I have a new 25 MHz Motorola 68040 that I am willing to sell if I get a good enough offer.

You drink and drive, you pay. No smiley. \",\"I told some friends of mine two weeks ago that Koresh was dead.  The FBI and the BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their stupidity and lies.      Now before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as  a bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.  They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet,  whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into town on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and  wondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers. First, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they didn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got it.  After the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were coming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that. Well, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.  Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to them they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised Koresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                   The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he  \\\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out. His grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise David Koresh.\\\"  Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a logical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.  Here's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must be done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?  I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how much money this was costing.  That was the start of the \\\"Justification\\\" part part of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.  But, back to the plan.  It is considered \\\"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\\\" to execute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.  They knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not sure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the  compound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.  I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR (Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were subjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical  agent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.  I have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of thing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.  We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these people 51 days.    I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole thing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks changed my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:  \\\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\\\"  It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.  One more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic weapons on the premises.

So the question is reversed, \\\"Why can't      we assume the universe just exists as you assume God to      \\\"just exist\\\"?  Why must there be a \\\"why\\\" to the universe?\\\"   It may be that one day man not only can create life but can also      create man.  Now, I don't see this happening in my lifetime,      nor do I assert it is probable.  But the possibility is there,      given scientists are working hard at \\\"decoding\\\" out \\\"genetic      code\\\" to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation.      Again, though, must there be \\\"why\\\" or a \\\"divine prupose\\\" to      man's existence?   As far as we can tell, man falls into the \\\"mammal\\\" catagory.  Now,      if there were something more to the man (say, a soul), then      we have yet to find evidence of such.  But as it is now, man      is a mammal (babies are born live, mother gives milk, we're      warm-blooded, etc.) as other mammals are and is similar in      genetic construction to some of them (in particular, primates).

As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye  stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population  there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately,  the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass  graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed  what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.  The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of  oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot  officials and their violation of the co-founder status of  the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat  engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution  to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked  Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and  only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues  consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories  to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply  was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at  all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which  was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece.  Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish  population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population.  The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded Greeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their  autonomy in a separate republic.  Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would rather not be involved with the island. But, given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights, liberties and their very lives.

Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to education, to establish a family and have children, to human dignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are more important to human existence that the rights of states.  2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.  3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an unresolved conflict exists.  4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples and nations.  5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.  6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional political means have failed.  7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the land, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.  8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice. When people love, they share.  Having stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.  1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew and the other Palestinian-Arab.  2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner, although born in areas under current Isreali control, is not entitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.  3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For the second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each subsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.   4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and Christian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of governments and international organizations.  5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on 'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the Middle-East in a graceful manner.  Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will attempt to identify some of these:  1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However, it is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation.  2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the 'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but Israeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be defeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights (see above)  3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their point of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People overrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of human rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar Bronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing assimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its effects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see above)  4.      It may objected that only a few people in Israel/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes.  5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has merits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than $3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government and by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the Middle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a non-segregated society in that worn-torn land.  I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment.\",\"This is the final public update to my dragon magazine auction.

For one #thing, a return on an investment has greater risk, and not a set return #(i.e. the amount of money you make can go up or down, or you might even #lose money).  The difference is, the risk of loss is shared by the #investor, rather than practically all the risk being taken by the #borrower when the borrower borrows from the bank. #  But is it different from stocks ?  If you wish to call an investor in stocks as a banker, well then its your choice .....  #>Relabeling does not make it interest free !! # #It is not just relabeling, as I have explained above.

One you have supplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the future (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating high-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less), I am not  going to care much about US confidentiality, am I?  Only people like the real me, who does care about travelling to various countries for business reasons, will sit up and follow laws like this, but I would contend that we're not the main threat.  I also have grave doubts whether an algorythm widely distributed in silicon could possibly be called \\\"classified.\\\"  It's like handing out military secrets to the whole world in envelopes marked \\\"don't open me.\\\"  I can imagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to a trial.  One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.   Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable for a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware? In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you just swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of that cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that it would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search algorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware. I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.   However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its  designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion  of such techniques seems credible.  Hmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name \\\"Clipper\\\" for this device. :) \",\" Oh come on, Silly, all you have to do is cut a hole in your hood and  put a tube there so you can get to the oil fill hole.

This was a heresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD.  It grew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia and by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believes that Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which is correct), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfect harmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesus came in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human will.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject to original sin. It is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies.  It also was condemned, at a late council in Constantinople I believe.

Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll try to get better.  Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far, only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.  Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K.  vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.   I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of excuses.    I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.  From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I  see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see the dialog:   Me:  \\\"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\\\"   BK:  \\\"There is no truck.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around at look.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at      the oncoming truck.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around or you will run over.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\\\"  Me:  \\\"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing       to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\\\"       I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.  BK:  \\\"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.       Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\\\"       And by the way, I really have an open mind.\\\"   So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?     I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have. I can now see the truck behind Brian.  My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment, Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. \",\"  I recommend the book \\\"Adams _v_ Texas\\\", the story of a man (Adams) who was sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit.

My beliefs are those things which I find to be true based on my experience of the world.  This experience includes study of things that I may not have experienced directly.  But even then, I can only understand the studies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to what I have experienced.  Which means that by beliefs about God are directly related to my experience of God.  Having experienced God, I try to make sense of that experience.  I study religion and read the Bible.  I find things that echo what I have already experienced.  Out of this I build my beliefs.  I also find things that don't match my experience.  That doesn't make them false.  They just don't match my experience.  Maybe I will understand that stuff later.  I don't know.  Maybe all of my beliefs are wrong.  I can change my beliefs.  If someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what. Neither of us are necessarily wrong.  Someone else is making sense out of a different set of experiences.  Even though we have different explanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that the underlying experiences are similar.  Some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one form, and usually has a single revelation.  The more dogmatic and inflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to an outsider.  There is another approach possible, however.  God is a mystery.  I am trying to solve the mystery, so I look at the evidence available to me.  I try to arrive at the best understanding that I can based on the evidence.  New evidence may cause me to change my understanding.  When I encounter someone with a different belief than my own, it isn't a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discover something new about this mystery I can never fully comprehend.

'I don't believe you,\\\" I said, but followed to a nail-studded door. The    man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse.    I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and    went inside.   The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for   its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an   iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black   with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As   the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face   up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what   was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted,   as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so   I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his    slashed genitals.\\\"  p. 363 (first paragraph).    'How many people lived there?'  'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned.  'Did you see any Turk officers?'  'No, sir. I was in at dawn.

For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,  Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would  have been.   From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....  The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over  the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last   scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags,   looms, even spinning-wheels.   'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must   leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.'

We'd close in on three  sides. \\\"The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,\\\" Merrimanov said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow. \\\"That is for morale,\\\" Dro put in. \\\"We must keep the Moslems in terror.\\\" \\\"Soldiers or civilians?\\\" I asked. \\\"There is no difference,\\\" said Dro. \\\"All are armed, in uniform or not.\\\" \\\"But the women and children?\\\" \\\"Will fly with the others as best they may.\\\"  p. 360.  \\\"The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet   down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said   Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'   Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets  clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;  then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the  spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though   I heard our Utica brass roar.   As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing  of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,  dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow  puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.  The came a shrill wailing.   Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about  house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in  clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen  were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.   'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape  over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked  breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by  afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and  the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.   At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward  Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and   tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,  through alders, on smoldering houses.

Between   the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun   dress.   The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He   lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the   pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed   just below his neck, into the spine.

I'd be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain everything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and then on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug and we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably didn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit they wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or something.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they report every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating that the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to happen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific. There are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking. Patients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks to themselves properly.  I'm sure Herman is going to \\\"go ballistic\\\", but so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been reported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will refuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for PDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need. I am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the domain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient. For common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help quite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the computer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly, physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have, as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked things that the patients should have found out from their physician but didn't.  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either. Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They won't be as afraid to ask the system, we hope. --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\" Ref: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade  MAGI:   [Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting  ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous  _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which  most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the  second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of  the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi  to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]    The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain  etymology. It may originally have meant \\\"member of the tribe,\\\" as in the Avestan compound mogu-tbish (\\\"hostile to a member of the tribe\\\"). This meaning would have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \\\"member of the priestly tribe\\\" and perhaps to \\\"priest\\\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is probably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \\\"Magoi\\\" as one of the six tribes of the Medes.   For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were responsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their knowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the Great (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political and civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period (Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by Darius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.   The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.   There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the Avestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \\\"gift\\\"), is not without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found, in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of purity, or separation of the \\\"mixture\\\" of the two opposed principles of spirit and matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \\\"chorus,\\\" from the root mangh, which is said to mean \\\"sing the magic song\\\" (Nyberg, 1966) and has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the Avestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite a recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore the Avestan term for \\\"priest,\\\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is  perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis  (Gershevitch, 1964).   The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in particular derives from an older form, magupati (\\\"head of the Magi\\\"). During the Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of a hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\\\"the high priest of high priests\\\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.   The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl., khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it. The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons of putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the Parsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this rite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was in vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with wax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples of Central Asia.   The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a ritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also known for the practice of killing harmful, or \\\"Ahrimanical,\\\" animals (khrafstra) such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants, tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of felt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their breath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition that is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was that of the priesthood: white.   In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this they were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible for teaching the prince the \\\"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\\\" and thus the \\\"cult of the gods.\\\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and master of himself.   During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of Gaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself Smerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation - the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media, in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.   No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were renowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of the greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in Bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were also known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism; this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek, like \\\"goes,\\\" \\\"expert in the magic arts\\\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.   To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called western Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must have been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.   The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical historians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism, belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology and eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted Zoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and placed themselves under his venerable name.   Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the Zoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \\\"the law-abjuring daivas\\\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and practices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the supreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.; Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it has been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own priesthood, would be very strange.   The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the first millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to us especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles of the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\\\"beneficent spirit\\\") and Angra Mainyu (\\\"hostile spirit\\\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans- formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro- astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the Mesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known to the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which we give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]   Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises on the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have survived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of wisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an abundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).   Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]   The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the religious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce, 1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of Iran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to establish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures in the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar and Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.\",\"Hello,  I have a Hayes 9600 moden with no cables or manuals.

Some of the land was in fact given to the   Jews by the United Nations, quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab   absentee landlords. Present claims are based on prior ownership (purchase   from aforementioned absentee landlords) award by the United Nations in the   partition of the Palestine mandate territory, and as the result of   defensive wars fought against the Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, et al.  *** First, I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the   idea that the West Bank is theirs. Since,  however, I agree with those who   claim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West   bank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion   to attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis   promptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining   possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats   national suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it   is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them   and the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs   continues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they   can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West   Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is   the small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West   Bank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even   leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't   going to propose giving up Jerusalem.

Velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside of stock airboxes on a number of bikes.  At a tuned engine rpm, the stacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air rushing in. Air momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside long after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke. Shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from escaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion chambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing) to the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they design for shock waves.\",\" No, it isn't.

And when the press runs out of things to say about  the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers.  Grant Fuhr, Essa Tikkannen, Butch Goring, Bob Nystrom, Bob Gainey, Doug Jarvis, Derek Sanderson, Wayne Cashman, Bob Baun, Bob Pulford, Ralph Backstrom, Henri Richard, Dick Duff...and so on...  cordially, as always,  rm \",\"Any more news on Steve's status since he lost the starting job would be appreciated\",\"Does XDM work with DECnet? I have an Ultrix machine running both TCP/IP and DECnet. I have a number of X-terminals hanging off the Ultrix host also running TCP/IP and DECnet. Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure on the X-terminals using TCP/IP. Since XDM is basically just an X-windows client, shouldn't I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well?\",\" Do you consider Neo-Nazis and white supremists to be Christian?  I'd hardly classify them as Christian.  Do they follow the teachings of Christ?  Love one another.  Love your neighbour as yourself.  Love your enemies.  Is Jesus Christ their Lord and Saviour?  By the persecution of Jews, they are violating all the precepts of what Christ died for.  They are in direct violation of the teachings of Christ.  Even Jesus who was crucified by the Jewish leaders of that time, loved His enemies by asking the Father for forgiveness of their sins.  I am a Christian and I bear no animosity towards Jews or any one else. The enemy is Satan, not our fellow man.  God be with you,\",\"The parable of the Prodigal Son is not about who is and who isn't an immoral person. It is about grace and the love of God. Most people would agree with that concerning the younger son. The elder son is simply a negative example of the some thing. He thinks that he must earn his father's love, that he has earned it, that he is entitled to it. His father tells him that he is on the wrong track. He has always been loved--for the same reason his brother has always been: he is his father's son.  We are too performance oriented to consistently get the point. We are willing to be saved by grace, but once we are Christians we want to go back to earning and deserving.  \\\"Are you so foolish?

I've known several Jesuits who would laugh in his face if he presented such an argument to them.  Let's ignore the fact that it's not a true trilemma for the moment (nice word Maddi, original or is it a real word?) and concentrate on the liar, lunatic part.  The argument claims that no one would follow a liar, let alone thousands of people.  Look at L. Ron Hubbard.  Now, he was probably not all there, but I think he was mostly a liar and a con-artist.  But look at how many thousands of people follow Dianetics and Scientology.  I think the  Baker's and Swaggert along with several other televangelists lie all the time, but look at the number of follower they have.  As for lunatics, the best example is Hitler.  He was obviously insane, his advisors certainly thought so.  Yet he had a whole country entralled and came close to ruling all of Europe.  How many Germans gave their lives for him?  To this day he has his followers.  I'm just amazed that people still try to use this argument.  It's just so obviously *wrong*.                \",\"  HEAR HEAR!!!

Gay people are and will con- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may be unaware of all the statistica \\\"findings\\\" concerning African-Americans that have been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias against African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances, but there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public scoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case. Fortunately African-Americans had \\\"whites\\\" who supported their 'cause' and public sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was even a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty much legal to discriminate against them.  I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something, that is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society, including gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation and making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love, and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular to do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes in the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actually sho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially within their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian community for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists against the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and treated as runaway slaves for being \\\"nigger-lovers\\\" and such.  I guess I've decided the challenge is worth it.  In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic story centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight who have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of one case where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject their gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they began to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.  I'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0 raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values Coalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner support within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more oppressive legisation against gays.  Perhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in the Middle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands in witch hunts and inquisitions.  The message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay rights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even hatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change the results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the final effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a \\\"conditional\\\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This is sure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \\\"unconditional\\\" love, one that calls people \\\"just as they are.\\\"  Sure there are things that will 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that need to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things like left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \\\"other people's expectations.\\\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many people a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their own sense of pseuper-spirituality.  This is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with something very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but I firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation on thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfully removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation, but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society. Gay people are not criminals.  Another interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic church in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self- admitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently been going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were voluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that was how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing happen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends recently told me he was \\\"approached\\\" by someone who is going through the reparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.  These are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not the call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in Colorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over Colorado called \\\"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\\\" (I forget the whole definition off hand, but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto is \\\"Working for a fag-free America\\\" with an implicit advocation for violence.  This is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are embracing.  We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from organizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good purpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of excluding people.  The Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \\\"include\\\" people.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful, especially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto itself.  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?

When I installed NDW, it wanted to rem out the line that installed EP (EP /ON) and the command to invoke the Image utility. It replaced the Image command with a new image command that invokes the version of Image that came with NDW.  This makes sense, as presumably the Image version with NDW is newer than the one with NU.  It did not, however, install smartcan in the autoexec.  Now two questions:    1:  Will NU use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked.        i.e. Are the two version of Image compatable?    2:  Will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa?

And if not, it is clear that the deaths would not have occured if the BATF has   not FUCKED UP initially, and now the FBI got impaitent and pushed Korech over   the edge.  And that's if you buy the latest version of the \\\"story\\\" hook, line, and sinker.    I have believed all along that they could not let them live, the embarrassment   to the BATF and the FBI would've been too severe.  Remember, this was a suspicion of tax-evasion warrant.  There were no   witnesses, except the FBI.  All information filtered through the FBI.  All they   had to do was allow one remote controlled pool camera be installed near the   building, and the press could've done their job, and would've been able to back   the FBI's story with close up video, while incurring no risk to the press.    Unless they did not want the public to see something.  The complete lack of any   other source of information other than the FBI really causes me concern.

In the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping  with a good-sized belt, and then taken into some hospital to see first hand  what kind of damage such accidents cause.   Of course this doesn't happen  any more.  That whipping would probably save the kid's life by teaching  him some respect for others.  A person with that little respect would  inevitably wind up dead early anyway.     The problem is creeping gradualism.  If you put a frog into hot water,  he just jumps out.  But if you put him into cold water and then ever-so-  gradually heat it, the frog will cook.

I say keep the kids in  school longer, feed them good food and teach them something, and when  they get home, have a parent there to interact and monitor them.  There  is a very old and now forgotten proverb: a child left on his own will  bring a parent to grief.  Daycare systems are not the answer.

We were able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the Palestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid - currently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous statement: \\\"You look for me !\\\", i.e., I'am not making any more efforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid's point of view, Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew or the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the Palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly MERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his government's and his party's lack of action for human rights and peace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether they would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists' perspective this is the best government because it is THEIR government, regardless of what it does.  These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the future of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to dictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step towards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin's government, and from their point of view the expulsions were a marginal byproduct of this \\\"government of peace\\\", which need not disturb the routine course of events. Likewise the \\\"Rabinic\\\" policies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in the suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.  But the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces itself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has lost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian workers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel Aviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing to propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from the Palestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be able to harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.  Meron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): \\\"...The liberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical separation and 'the future of the territories', must come to understand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab workers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement designed for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that their ideological support for separation only provides 'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status quo>.  Enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the ruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears its burden. [.....].  \\\"Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal, humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether this position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off responsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to thus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is very easy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at the disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue all their interests, but is barred to the Arabs...\\\".\",\" The best info I have seen so far is the article \\\"Joystick Metrics: Measuring physical properties through the PC's joystick port\\\" by Michael Covington in the May 1985 issue of PC Tech Journal.  It talks about how to read all kinds of things (voltage, current, resistance) in BASIC, and even includes code for a simple \\\"oscilloscope\\\" display.  It's possible to read the joystick port directly if you don't want to use BASIC.  The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical Reference under Options and Adapters.  You have to provide some millisecond resolution timing functions, but that's a subject which has appeared many times in articles from Dr. Dobb's, Circuit Cellar Ink, etc.  Look for the public domain ztimer package on wuarchive.

The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV In order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than that.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a PC.  Before you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a low distortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  Digital Domain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitized waveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on the spectrum.  That's should give you a good indication of the design. (That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed - I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)  If you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking at the MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) complete sampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and it uses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated from the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog design guide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.  They claim a -77db max (-85 typ.) THD.  Looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces  A evaluation kit is available.  Might want to give these nice folks a call.  1-800-998-8800 or fax: (408)737-7194 and (408) 737-7600 ext4000 for application assistance.  This assumes that you can build your own DAS and write your own software. (Hey you can get the MAX121 as a free sample just by calling the 1-800 #)   I would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out of your system by looking at the noise level, otherwise you might be throwing out your money.

The first clause is not a condition, it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS, MILITIA OR NOT, that the people have a right to keep and bear arms.  This is NOT a right granted by the Constitution, it is a right presumed to exist by default.  The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the government from removing that right by stating very clearly the government shall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right.  Remember the Constitution is a bunch of negative things - things the government CANNOT do.  All rights, etc not epxressly given to the government go to the states and the PEOPLE (the same people the other 9 Amendments in the Bill of Rights talk about).  Since I am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation, I am appending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself (and you, I suspect).  I am sure you will find his qualifications adequate. If that isn't enough I can send you the Senate Subcommitee to the Judiciary on the Constitution report on the same thing...  There are some things in there that Big Brother types, like Biden, etc must have really had to swallow hard to admit.  I think you will find that people that seriously study the Constitution and state what it means will say the same thing.  Those who come up with 'new improved meanings' are those who are trying to subvert the Constitution for a given agenda.  Like Clinton and his Clinton Cripple, Gun Control, People Control, and Control Control, and the whole nasty mess.  Please tell us how this person is in error, won't you? (And please back it up with some proof, since I am backing my assertion up with independent proof, and have a BUNCH MORE I can provide...).  NOTE:  Followups set to talk.politics.guns  --------- Begin included article -------     THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT           by J. Neil Schulman  If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan, right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call would be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call if you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?  That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr. Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of \\\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\\\"  A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's expertise.  Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at USC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for \\\"Editor and Publisher\\\", a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field.  He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's fifth book on usage, \\\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\\\" has been in continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.  That sounds like an expert to me.  After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent the following letter:  \\\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.  \\\"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further, since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under oath to support, if necessary.\\\"  My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment, then concluded:  \\\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment. While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\\\"  After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political subject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity):  [Copperud:] \\\"The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a clause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb 'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia.  \\\"In reply to your numbered questions:  [Schulman:] \\\"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringed'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed' null and void?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,' 'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200 years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \\\"Since a well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'  [Schulman:] \\\"As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second Amendment to the following sentence,  \\\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,  \\\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?; and  \\\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure.  \\\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation.\\\"  Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his cover letter: \\\"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach any conclusion.\\\"  So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.  As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.  And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely. American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms, guaranteed by the Constitution.  And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.  it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?  Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution of the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

[1]  Born 1964 Secretary-Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization  Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan]   On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show, at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards  away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \\\"The Abyss.\\\"  Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at  the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation  whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it  was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if  someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There  were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that  large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well  mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an  Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that  they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do  to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded  a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move  over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone  recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina.  It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats.  Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis,  people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the  auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and  gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \\\"OK, we've  scared them enough, let's leave.\\\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to  me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of  \\\"anasha\\\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like  they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing  had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful  films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We  could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine,  and it was dark . . .  Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting,  something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially  listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to  make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation  wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,  policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors  there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some  naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well,  since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super  serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we  live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the  driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and  he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well,  OK . . .  So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was  happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation  was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \\\"Ka-ra-bagh,\\\" they're not going  to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had  come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to  cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma  down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though  nothing had happened.  That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and  didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't guess.  On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda,  Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and  no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that  morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda  Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, \\\"Don't they want Armenians? Well what  are they after, if they're already in that state?\\\" She says, no, nothing like  that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The  cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.  Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy  problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, \\\"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\\\" Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home  and told Mamma. Mamma said, \\\"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on.\\\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I  tell Lyuda, \\\"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see  you out.\\\" Mamma says, \\\"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can  see what the situation in town is.\\\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was  ready. Mamma says, \\\"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\\\" We sat down at the  table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything  out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television, and the show \\\"In Fairy-Tale Land\\\" was coming on.  We cleared the table.  We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't  see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people  . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's  an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story  buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20  people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see  several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not  killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of  the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their  feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in  general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not.  I become terrified and go home and say, \\\"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \\\" Then the crowd  runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and  starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors  are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is  shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it  turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and  kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop  them.  They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the  windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard,  and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't  crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey  Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear  tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous  din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were  shouting Father's name, \\\"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\\\" or something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma  says, \\\"Into the bedroom, quickly!\\\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part  of our dowry; Mamma says, \\\"Hide there, they probably won't come in there,  they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\\\" She says, \\\"We'll tell them  that we live alone here.\\\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in  the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say  that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I  can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak  Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told  her anything or not.  Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, \\\"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened.\\\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \\\"Get out of the apartment, leave.\\\" I  say, \\\"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the  apartment.\\\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, \\\"There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!\\\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts,  commanding them: \\\"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\\\"  And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start  undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there,  in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how  much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The  atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among  themselves who would go first.  Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding.  He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It  seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, \\\"Well, we're done here.\\\" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs  . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the  window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the  windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking  about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong  person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be,  which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they  don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I  humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing  . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.  I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't  know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by  my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings,  something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death  come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What  happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.   I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me  clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember  that I said the same words over and over again: \\\"Mamma, what happened, Mamma,  what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\\\" I can't make  sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all  went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his  courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though  he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he  served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor  brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,  \\\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\\\" How do I know who's who  and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when  they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda  said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going  to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's  hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our  sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding  on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in  there. So they survived.  My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back  up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed  there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put  it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and  knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \\\"I'm not going to let you  in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings  and we'll leave the building.\\\" Lyuda says, \\\"I'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\\\" It was just for a  moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came  back to our place and lay under the bed . . .  I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone  number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he  came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were  simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,  it was hard to breathe . . .  My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our  administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary  passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right  after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a  great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not  only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next,  without stopping. After us.  I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young  Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.  Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in  Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \\\"Run quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\\\" At that moment  three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,  there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything  out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to  scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you  here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of  the soldiers said, \\\"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the  Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\\\" So at that point the  Daghestan police were there.  When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously  injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they  were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda  and me and said, \\\"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't  know what to do with the rest.\\\"  So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My  boss said, \\\"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens.\\\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She  examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait  ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People  called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.  That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself,  \\\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\\\" She looks me over and  says, \\\"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things.\\\" And I think, great, I have to deal  with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this  condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't  have the energy to say, \\\"How could our people possibly be smart enough to  think of something that yours haven't already done?\\\" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her  own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next  morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything  more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,  nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at  them.  I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \\\"Better to ask  your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can  better explain what happened.\\\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw  themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward.  Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me  clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress,  but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up  above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \\\"I can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\\\" I went back to my  ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and  brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I  couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one  had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . .  Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should  be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an  Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must  have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something  else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.  The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,  and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many  troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw  a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought  that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait  after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't  come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.  I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm  me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw  a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each  other and asking, \\\"What happened, what went on?\\\" Two days later they came to  see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed  interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they  could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues  who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,  neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what  happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart  . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came,  not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part  of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I  lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be  from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of  insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful.  There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took  me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were  emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's  friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic.  They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasn't cut.  They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon  appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not  talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \\\"We  demand that Seidov come!\\\" The response was, \\\"It's Seidov who sent us.\\\" Seidov  is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said,  \\\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same  things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you  agitators.\\\" And so on. More of them said, \\\"Have Seidov himself come.\\\" This  went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us  out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because  they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The  smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who  had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a  club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay  to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day  someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie  theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it  was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants  took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in  Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to  mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting  right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only  the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women  were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come  any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered  together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie  theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to  the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and  couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently  they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my  eyes.  Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \\\"Aren't you an  Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\\\" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in  nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs.  So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't  spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered  the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only  the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself,  she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the  building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children.  This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were  already in the city.  They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire  families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't  see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult  now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify  the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard  that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people,  including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3.  They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who  had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were  going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply  savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did  what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that  hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from  the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the  ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and  she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and  beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that  whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and  carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.  I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of  people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a  song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has  that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,  the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They  couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face.  I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had  talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the  Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met  with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint  meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of  those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.  They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were  dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch  me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these  people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan.  The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was  there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't  recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, \\\"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\\\" He turned away  and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina  anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out  anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became  myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people  there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his  name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one  we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \\\"If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his  alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not  responsible for my words.\\\" He said, \\\"What did they do to you, how awful,  myself, I hid an Armenian family.\\\" Then after some time goes by he comes back  again and says something entirely different: \\\"I wasn't at home, my family and  I went to Baku.\\\" I said, \\\"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before.\\\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is  being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me  that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.  What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the  head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an  insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the  same time  I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I can't say.                                                       When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it,  because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it  always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my  face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed,  they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41,  is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ  dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our  building was killed, it was that man.  A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come  over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was  all over, people started making announcements in town saying that  investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now  they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he  himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy  came to the plant and said, \\\"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the  bus station on Saturday at ten.\\\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do  you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent,  probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go,  because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had  killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of  that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that  the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from  I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word  I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an  Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know.  His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from  Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time.  His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani  KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many  photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at  curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this,  the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a  haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he  is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did,  I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment.  At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,  all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, \\\"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like  you.\\\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything  without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when  she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had  all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.  They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that  moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the  faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the  apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and  no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have  anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the  apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the  apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they  know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the  building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis  lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our  apartment.  I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt  when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from  our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \\\"Karina, we  saw all of it, how could it happen?\\\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to  me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been  able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani  woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated  woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two  Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She  came down to the entryway and said, \\\"You'll come in this entryway over my dead body.\\\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some  folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't  even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They  couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani  stopped them.  They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place  they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the  apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that?  Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is  some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed  to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had  come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They  screamed and screamed: \\\"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\\\"  Only they didn't shout \\\"kill,\\\" they shouted \\\"gurun ermianlary.\\\" Gurun  literally means \\\"kill,\\\" or \\\"destroy.\\\"  That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their  kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part  of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . .  A boy said to my mother \\\"Where's the gold?\\\" Mamma said he must have been 12  to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the  Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the  fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where  the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a  little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to  wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were  bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and  Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth,  bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had  shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and  tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having  trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and  started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted  to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by  accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,  \\\"What's happened?\\\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \\\"At least go and  find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or  murdered them, at least bring the corpses.\\\" He went looking for us. At that  moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that  someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out  from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought  she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to  herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from  under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that  way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled  down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it happened in.  And Mamma said, \\\"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting  something or other, and running toward the other building.\\\" It had more or  less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I  tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \\\"Listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how  long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\\\" I don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe  not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \\\"Mamma, what do you need any of that  for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\\\" She says, \\\"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the  night at someone else's.\\\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were  coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He  shouts, \\\"Come back, they're coming!\\\" They didn't have enough time to get a  lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my  knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his  wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to  leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,  they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building,  maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished  building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more  or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.  Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there,  something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even  live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and  mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television.  They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \\\"My  God, what is going on around here? When will this end?\\\" We turned off the  lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who  knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but  they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that  he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his  apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up  at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, \\\"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us.\\\" He went upstairs, and they say, \\\"Aren't you taking anything from this  apartment?\\\" He says, \\\"I don't need anything.\\\" And the women who were standing  in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were  standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the  first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time  to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty  pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really  mad, and he says, \\\"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\\\" They tell him,  \\\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\\\" He ran off in that direction.  Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms,  there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They  just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man,  she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told  me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them,  the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \\\"Where's the girl who was here?\\\" And he became furious. The woman tells him, \\\"She came to . . . \\\" She didn't know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \\\"She came to and went to the basement.\\\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the  whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took  flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been  standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there  to get me. Then one of them said, \\\"There's so much water down there, she  probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in  the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\\\" I didn't know that, and  when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't  just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .  After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really  didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and  started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all.  Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people  who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think  that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but  they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole  brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\\\" That's  all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not  one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were  standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women  that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for  one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,  an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom:  if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed  to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \\\"If you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\\\" So she left. That trick didn't work on them.  Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget  that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,  then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister.  And no one did anything. Anything.

The Mets couldn't hold an early lead against the Cards that final Sunday, or there would have been a 3-way tie.  Too bad they couldn't have saved some of the 15 or so runs they scored on Saturday when they crushed St. Louis. --\",\"If anyone out there has an HP180 series scope or mainframe, I have the TDR plug in (the 1810, I believe) for it and have no need to keep it.

I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly  overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and  average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t  think I'm off by much.

The Clinton administration  nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever  in regulating cryptography. To do so is tantamount to regulating  `acceptable' speech, and is blatantly unconstitutional. Perhaps we  should rename this year `1984' in honor of such an illustrious  proposal.  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy, and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure.  I am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures.  The U.S. government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any serious threat to my liberties such as this, and I call on everyone with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this  proposal.  The administration does not seem to understand that they are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public, and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is  wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty.   It seems to me that U.S. Diplomatic communications should be  tappable by the U.N. whenever any countries produce a warrant to the U.N.  In fact, I think we should stop paying the NSA billions of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason. These actions violate the sovereignity of international law. (I hope Mr. Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here. But if he isn't, it's a modest and reasonable proposal, so he should find merit with it nevertheless.)  Cryptography is neutral technology. If everybody has strong  cryptography (including policemen, bureacrats, businessmen,  housewives, thugs and hoodlums), we have a sustainable  equilibrium.  Anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian  arrangement, intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms, and guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent  impracticality. We don't need to compromise on issues of freedom.   For too long our government has demonstrated itself to be  increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality  and protecting Americans.   It is not possible for the Federal Government to ``act quickly'' or develop ``consistent, comprehensive policies'' PERIOD.  And even if by some grandiose miracle such a thing were possible, it would only be an efficient way to deprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights.  The administration has to be committed to leaving private  industries alone, esp. on this issue.  The government has no  legitimate role in regulating the content of communications. Law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their surveillance bludgeon; they are soon and inevitably to be  disarmed of it.    No such laws can be constitutionally sound, and this is equivalent to a veiled threat, which I don't appreciate.  This kind of  extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism. I will trade threats for threats, and violation for violation.   If the administration did say this, it would find itself  impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential, established, entrenched, and explicit constitutional privacy  guarantees. The administration would have no legal standing  whatsoever; such an action would be egregiously illegal and criminal, and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast  segments of the population.   The U.S., comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically  committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an  increasingly totalitarian government, is saying just that.   Take your chips and give them to NSA employees as Christmas bonuses. We can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please,  and we will make any chips we please, and we will send any bit  pattern over our data highways we please. And if you try to stop  us, you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness.  [privacy vs. law enforcement]  This is an outright Dingaling Denning lie.  The two aims of privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally  incompatible, and you have to work for the NSA to think otherwise.  Americans are about to discover ways, through the use of technology,  to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly  been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and  *unrepresentative* government.  --\",\"      The Giants always hit Maddux well, but it was interesting that Maddux did not pitch around Bonds to get to Clayton last night.  He threw 2 straight fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the first one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd, when Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally walk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.       The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has not scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I'm concerning about his on-base percentage.  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams, he has to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base.         The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL.  Burba has done a superb job filling in so far, he looks like a different pitcher from last year.  However, Swift is terrible in both of his starts.  With Burba moving into the rotation, Mike Jackson is the only right-handed reliever aside from Rod Beck, he'll get a lot of actions.

After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were intermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining 5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.  Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems. Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I then insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the IIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me another RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see the drive there's a definite hardware problem.  Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send me a *new* one, but they said \\\"no.\\\" Also, within three weeks after I purchased my original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.  I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data recovery.)  It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new.   I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La Cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful. But c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent a letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even  have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)  What's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy any other products from La Cie in the future.  Bill Krauthammer f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu\",\" The New York talk shows are just awful in this regard.

You are merely expressing \\\"approval\\\" of the consequences I find therein. Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my (or any) religion.  \\\"Love\\\" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians can write both the \\\"gentle\\\" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in a passage that even the \\\"conservatives\\\" will quote at you :-) -- and the words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \\\"Love is the unfamiliar Name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\\\"  This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise in my note, as will become more evident below.   blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though, given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of \\\"sin\\\" on another, and my unshakeable \\\"disestablishmentarianism\\\", Russel Turpin and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of Christian love.   You misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \\\"God\\\" in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:  The \\\"possibility that always exists\\\" is that I (or, to revert to proper time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could persuade \\\"Christian B\\\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian] prohibitions.  What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:   A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved      in the Inquisition.   B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however      painful this *seems*, \\\"discipline\\\" her children for their      own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or      if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example      \\\"deterring\\\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)   A.  I point out that this \\\"justification\\\" of a failure in love      depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of      philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.   B.  Burns me at the stake.  My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is going on here has a *lot* to do with \\\"cultural baggage.\\\"  In this case, the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B.  Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B, then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what- ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney.  So, \\\"one possibility\\\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in may others.  At the other extreme, the \\\"persuasion\\\" will succeed when it properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that many of the victims of Inquisition will have \\\"accepted\\\" that they were in fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them.)  The point is that the \\\"persuasion\\\" breaks down when the parties do NOT share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main thrust of the Inquisition, against \\\"heresy\\\", it is *bound* to break down in precisely the \\\"worst\\\" cases.  The \\\"conservative\\\" (I don't think that is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above, that he is \\\"justified\\\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to a \\\"greater good.\\\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow the gospel, as if one's theories about \\\"sin\\\" entitled one to cast aside Jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).  I am a \\\"radical\\\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.   Well, the whole *point* of making these the \\\"base\\\" commandments is that they *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \\\"Conservatives\\\" may twist this \\\"act as if you were God\\\" to mean \\\"lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.\\\" They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \\\"against God\\\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \\\"conservatives\\\" have confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.   And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged *different* \\\"ethical systems\\\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result, it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular (or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH. It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very little, if anything, in the way of \\\"commandments\\\" -- so little that the \\\"Christians\\\" who desperately *want* commandments go \\\"mining\\\" for them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-)) for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus specifically \\\"gives\\\" as \\\"a commandment\\\" to us is \\\"love one another.\\\"   [I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson   that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that   SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll   point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why   there is a huge amount of \\\"cultural baggage\\\" involved.]  You are quite right that this is \\\"goo\\\" if one is looking for an ethical system.  But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.   I think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity? [Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]\",\"Probably within 50 years, a new type of eugenics will be possible.

On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of similar passages where Jesus says things like \\\"even XXX will be better off than you in the judgement.\\\"  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens, so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the Mormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition to the Bible and \\\"Holy Tradition\\\" of a more generic Christian sort.  Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free us from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you like test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale, but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading. Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to see why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are differences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all agree that in one way or another, God cheats.  I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't explicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their hearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in principle, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing line.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not.\",\"Does anyone know where I can still get an internal fax modem for the  original mac portable?

Nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  An  instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to  Nazi theoreticians, Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted, and in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies were considered not pure Gypsies but \\\"mongrels\\\" formed from the pure Gypsy  race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between  the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies, by the way.

Another naive illusion down the toilet....      ----- Tommy McGuire mcguire@cs.utexas.edu mcguire@austin.ibm.com\",\"        Hmmm... people in the americas before the time of Christ, children who die young, etc. ?        But of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.       I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond  bodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe they're going to hell. They believe they're going to _die_. Understand that you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows that all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you want to say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven, but this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (die a final death))     I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_ sort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that there will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence.  (assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'll never know I'm dead. Hmmm...         Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Heaven now.\\\" ?      Consider the following statement:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Hell now.\\\"      The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell,  it would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering.  Granted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any conscious experience whatsoever).       You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning  to a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort  of eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this eternity.       Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda (\\\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\\\" It's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife. Can anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all animals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of super-survival.          That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and  an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King, I might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_ by Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven.  \\\"Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?\\\" asked an Eskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something to the effect of, \\\"Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting? Scram.\\\" I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an account of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no  immortality).         Pax,\",\"    Hmmm.

Jim -- jmd@handheld.com\",\" If we had backed him strongly early on I doubt there would be the problem there is now.  Many Russians became disillusioned with democracy and reforms when they felt, rightly IMO, that the West didn't care.  Yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid (once Bush got over his Gorby-mania.)  This probably kept him from dismantling the congress and calling for new elections.  Well, the aid didn't come through and we didn't make sure it went to the proper places and now the anti-reformers are gaining strength where before they were in hiding.   If they don't reform I don't believe in giving them money.  However, I think this is too important to take a non-interventionist approach. This is what really bugs me about Libertarianism -- it sounds like 'it'll all be the same in a hundred years time.  no need to do anything.'  Despite the wishes of Libertarians, this society is a far way, and getting farther, from being Libertarian.  Perhaps voluntary gifts would work if we had the proper framework but we do not have it.  We have to face the problem *now*, not in X years when we have a Libertarian dream society.  Right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade, let alone charity. There are still limitations to high-tech exports.  NASA can't buy Proton launch vehicles from them.  Sure, the market may be able to help a great deal but it can't right now.  There are too many obstacles. Instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to  tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face.  Well, I think limited government is primarily democratic due to it being limited.  But the main question is how do you transform a state-run economy and monolithic government into something that even remotely looks like ours?  (BTW, sometimes it seems that our government  is trying to go the opposite direction)  It is not going to be painless and not going to be easy.  We simply cannot wait to help when they *have* the 'proper' government.  They'll never get there without the aid.  It may be too late already.   And I'm just excercising mine.   As I also said above, another problem I have is with *transformation*. A Libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight. I have seen nothing about how to take our current government and society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible self-sufficient populace.     They didn't have nuclear weapons 100 years ago.  Nor instantaneous communications nor travel to virtually anyplace on the earth in less than a day.   Yes, depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses.  Rulers do emerge *somewhere* and they will never represent the opinions of every person on the planet.    There must be checks and balances.  Checks on the government when it gets out of bounds and checks on industry when it gets out of bounds.

You may as well know that all this stuff about the secret source of the Clipper announcement is because of a silly mistake.  I am the administrator of csrc.ncsl.nist.gov, alias first.org.  It's a system set up to help out the needs of FIRST, a Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, which  includes a number of world-wide incident response teams such as CERT/CC and other places in Europe.  As to the VRFY and EXPN commands, they are normally disabled, since early on we didn't want crackers to find out the names of incident response folks on our mailing lists.  We had a disk crash several months ago which required completely rebuilding the O/S files - same old story, our backups weren't especially helpful.  As you can guess, I didn't remember to re-disable VRFY and EXPN until I saw people on the net trying to find out who was behind clipper@csrc...  When I saw people's names posted here, I felt it was time to clear things up.  So, EXPN and VRFY on csrc have always been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with  Clipper.  I posted the White House announcements at the request of policy folks here because csrc also provides Usenet service.  I posted them from an account called 'clipper.'  I also created an alias called 'clipper' that contains the addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and Advisory Board, set up under law of the Computer Security Act of 1987, and addresses of other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography, security, and privacy - I believe that these individuals were included on this list because NIST felt it important to get them the Clipper information first-hand.  The 'clipper' alias is there for the benefit of those named above.  It is  not a source for information, it was set up solely to monitor any initial traffic.  Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get traffic that is not already duplicated on Usenet.  While you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this, I would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives of the individuals on the 'clipper' alias - I've already apologized to them for what's happened.  Disabling EXPN and VRFY is an increasingly common practice (albeit unfriendly to some), and any effect of disabling it again was unintentional.\",\" Graeme>  Yes, that's known as \\\"Bresenhams Run Length Slice Algorithm for Graeme> Incremental lines\\\".

What I see as arrogance and the problem I have  with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just  Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.    Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal  sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these  matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them  but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus  anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that leads to arrogance.

How could somebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming?  Koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast.  He didn't.  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people.  And, from my meagre knowledge of the Bible, it seems that Christians have been hard on the Jews of Christ's day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the Messiah.

Between 1914 and 1920, Armenians  committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of  despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned  them, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound  hand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated  personal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most  unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history.                                  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  \\\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\\\" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. \\\"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.\\\"  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  \\\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  \\\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  \\\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\\\" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \\\"We have never got any of the bodies back.\\\"  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  \\\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\\\" Mr Sadikov said. \\\"I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.\\\"  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

Grief-stricken relatives in  the town of Agdam  (right) weep over the  coffin of another of the massacre victims.

Dave Winfield has had a better career than half the people in the Hall of Fame.  Eddie Murray and Darrel Evans are both one of the top 100 players of all time.  Lee Smith has had probably the greatest long career of any relief pitcher since 1960, with the possible exception of Gossage.  On the other hand, Kingman probably isn't one of the best 750 players of all time.  And Reardon, though a good pitcher, isn't in Smith's class career wise.    We're talking 2 of the top 50 players of all time here.  There probably aren't 5 shortstops in history who were better than these two.   Garvey sucked.  Morris, while a very good pitcher, simply doesn't belong near Cooperstown.   Gee, can these guys even compare to  If Puckett and Ryan (okay, no if there) get into to the Hall, they will be  marginal Hall of Famers (unless Puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for a while longer)  To put this in perspective, here's a listing of the linear weights values of the careers of the players you mention.  In parenthesis is how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it. While no one would claim these are perfect rankings, they should give you a good value of these guys' careers as compared to average players.

I don't believe that physical knowledge has a great deal of impact on the power of God.  In the past, God gave us the ability to create life through sexual relations.  Now, he is giving us the ability to create life through in vitro fertilization.  The difference between the two is merely  cosmetic, and even if we gain the ability to create universes we won't begin to approach the glory of God.   The power we are being given is a test, and I am sure that in many cases we will use our new abilities unwisely.  But, people have been using sexuality unwisely for millenia and I haven't heard an outcry to abolish it yet!   No matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world, we aren't impinging on God's power.  It's only when we attempt to gain control of the spiritual world, those things that can't be approached through science and  logic, that we begin to interfere with God.\",\"Time once again to clean out the ol' closet.

Then I'm sure you won't mind if the ATF or the DEA raid your house   someday on a bogus informant tip.  So what if they killed/wounded your    family \\\"accidentally\\\" during the raid, it's just a fair price to pay   for law and order in this country, right?  Answer this question    honestly before making anymore ignorant statements!      What is even more disturbing than out of control government agencies   are citizens who allow them to be irresponsible. \",\"    Here's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time dithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational  equipment to \\\"back out\\\" the errors in its position (since it knows where it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a  broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit.  The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will use existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately 305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals on different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system which has stations all across the US.  The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format. Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- John P. Baker                   | My opinions are my own.

That depends not only on their predisposition towards murder, but   also in their success rate at escape and therefore their ability   to commit the same crimes again.

RSA might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones.  Large companies in the voice/data comm business are out, because they all have contracts with the gov which would be used to pressure them.  If we, as professionals in crypto organizations, EFF, etc. were to put our collective minds and interests toward establishing a crypto standard for transmission, and getting our companies to implement it, we might avoid government control.  Otherwise, I think it will happen to us by default.  Gov isn't probably strong enough or foolish enough to prevent strong crypt.  They are strong enough, and we may be foolish enough, to push through the Clipper Chip.  Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?

I will argue that your latter statement, \\\"I believe that no gods exist\\\" does rest upon faith - that is, if you are making a POSITIVE statement  that \\\"no gods exist\\\" (strong atheism) rather than merely saying I don't   know and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then (weak atheism). Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying   I BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even  after reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.  But first let me say the following. We might have a language problem here - in regards to \\\"faith\\\" and \\\"existence\\\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist. To exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE being - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it's rather pointless to debate the so called \\\"existence\\\" of God - and that is not what I'm doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of being. When you say that \\\"god does not exist\\\", I also accept this statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However, in what follows I will use the phrase \\\"the existence of God\\\" in it's 'usual sense' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it. I would like a clarification upon what you mean by \\\"the existence of God\\\".   We also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what  faith  1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY b  (1): fidelity to one's promises    (2): sincerity of intentions 2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God    (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    (2): complete trust 3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF    One can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say that you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion \\\"based upon observation\\\", I will have to ask \\\"what observtions are you refering to?\\\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even be predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes  partents \\\"believe in God\\\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion about the \\\"existence\\\" or \\\"non-existence\\\" of God requires a leap - and you have made this leap when you actively say \\\"I believe that God   does/does not exist\\\". Personally, I think that both statements are misguided. Arguing over the \\\"existence\\\" of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him (and yes, I use \\\"Him\\\" because a personal God is the only  viable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \\\"She\\\" go ahead. Of course  God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to  anthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I'll be  glad to.)     And please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently  disagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person  thinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think  I have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my  ways and I correct the situation. I'm interested in a polite and well   thought out discussion.         \",\"Here is a different viewpoint.   In practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed  with inkjet because smudges etc. can happen.   A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of  that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than  you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the  printer. (I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the  printer)  A sage said to me: \\\"Do you want one copy or lots of copies?\\\", \\\"One\\\",  \\\"Inkjet\\\".    Paper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter  will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that  are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.  HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the  software package has no inkjet driver.   There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a  page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a  laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers  actually use this facility.

PST                     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING  on the aid package.        SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The  President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed  yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic  and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.          Before taking your questions and running through the  basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.   First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do  with available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds  have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is  no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund  any of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently  are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin  tomorrow.              The second point is that this package is designed to  support Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package  are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have  been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian  government.              Third, the President is determined that we will  deliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed  to maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we  wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we  feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in  front of you.              Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of  trade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's  capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend  well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of  governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do  so.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make  trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.                They also agreed that there would be a new joint  commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by  Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through  the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote  a vastly expanded relationship.              If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down  the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just  give you some general background on what these programs are.   I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.              The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food  and medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has  been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian  grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure  there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the  major cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food  for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also  be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and  pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.              The second item is concessional food sales.  As you  know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship  with Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia  that we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the  Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.   The value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are  concessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out,  but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on  principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates  thereafter for the life of the deal.              The third program is a collection of private sector  support.  We think this is one of the most important things we're  going to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses  is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.   And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American  enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the  goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in  Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.                The President has also decided to create a  privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian  government in its priority objective of trying to convert state  enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has  also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a  Eurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by  prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.              The fourth grouping you see there in the summary  page is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that  this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of  pursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total  of $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed  tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're  launching.                The President is also calling for the development of  a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to  try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public  efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in  Russia.              The fifth program you see is Russian office of  resettlement.  This is a new initiative created and  conceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration  project.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military  to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic  states and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to  make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's  with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American  construction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration  basis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working  very closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say  that we have a long-term commitment to this project.                The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They  are two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our  initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the  possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and  gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in  the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much  environmental damage.              I've talked a little bit about trade and investment,  about the new group being created that the Vice President will  chair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing  with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development  committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy,  to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede  trade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time  investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this  problem full-time.                And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and  investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an  analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we  just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a  commitment within our own government to have people work on it --  senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly  important.              You'll notice that the United States is going to  support Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer  status.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested  our advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the  long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is  paramount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are  supporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting  their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.                You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in  credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended  $150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil  project.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an  agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion  framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance  Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services.  We think this is a very important development.  We think we'll  get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo  conference, the G-7 conference.              Before I take any further questions, I'd like to  defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance  objectives with you.              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major  unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts  in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and  secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory  under the terms of the START I and START II agreements.    Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important  agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding  to three important programs.  The first is the program of $130  million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement  program.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for  bomber dismantlement -- $130 million.              The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for  the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed  from the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially  contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the  construction of that storage facility.                And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help  in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear  materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we  add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance  which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall  safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety  measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the  last couple of years.                So this is an area where we will be going a lot more  work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks,  and Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last  couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for  safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian  territory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of  START I, an agreement to accede to NPT.               So we are working very hard with all the parties to  the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with  them.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia  as a very important step in that process.              Q   The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in  Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with  Kazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the  same one, why do you feel it's necessary?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same  deal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil  field.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights  oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced  today.  So it's completely new.              Q   Can you tell us more about what's involved?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like  other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do  two things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west  Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating  oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.   The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the  natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which  will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what  Russia needs.              So we think this deal is very, very good development  for Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an  American company.  And the American government has played a  leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility  in OPIC and through the loan guarantee.              Q   So it's to search and also to renovate fields  that are already there?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.              Q   On that point, should other American companies  expect to get administration support for such deals, or should  they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2  billion?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know,  Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the  U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department  and the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we  think it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th,  there will be $2 billion in financing available for American  companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.              Q   That should take up all of the rest of the  deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be  support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a  tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas  companies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and  gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will  soak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may  even extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.              Q   What's the current year budget costs of that  $2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any  current year budget costs --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer  you to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.              Q   The concessional food sales -- is there any  current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in  which the payments are due?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional  food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.   USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to  expend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd  refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.              Q   Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?              Q      and the private sector -- how many folks are  going to be involved in that?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start  with the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt  coming into office that there were literally thousands of  organization, private organizations in the United States that in  one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve  democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.   And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that  had a variety of programs in this area.  And so the  administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try  to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give  some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the  efforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.              It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will  soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in  the former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might  use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of  our own government, but the resources of the American private  sector and schools and communities across the nation.              Q      any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word  yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated  besides the $300 million the President talked about?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration  is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What  the President has done this weekend is to consult really  intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional  measures the United States could take in some of these areas to  support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he  returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other  ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.              Q   Two questions about the $700 billion  agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of  consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.   So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you  explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans  for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit  into that situation?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the  United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains  and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think  between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history  here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through  the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle  to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of  last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on  that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and  therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that  program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and  other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we  could promote American grain sales.                And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've  announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the  Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient  authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked  for a concessional loan program.                I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a  short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but  a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what  this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are  worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of  principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the  life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of  interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we  believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal  for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments  and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this  very important grain relationship, which is important for them,  and it's important for the American farm community.              Q   I gather from what you say that this could make  it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC  loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through,  is that right?               SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit  about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing   the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program  because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you  know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around  $640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having  taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American  market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to  respond to a specific request from the Russian government for  major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the  grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there,  we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to  great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with  the Russian government and arrived at this solution.                I think the Russians are pleased because it provides  them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on  the short-term payments.              Q   Where do those funds actually come from?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the  Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's  authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do  not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want  to make that general point again:  Everything in this package,  the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been  allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration  can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very  important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year,  that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be  able to do so.              Q   How did you arrive at the figure of $700  million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually  have a range from 0 to --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason  for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us  that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and  harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the  shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the  harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the  same level of food imports from the West.              Q   I would imagine there's going to be some  considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other  republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.   Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for  the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with  some of the other republics?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very  conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending  American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet  Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the  area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that  you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and  roughly 50 percent to the other countries.               In the area of food sales, we have been active with  Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We  will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this  summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the  other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are  productive and they're hard-hitting.              Q   Has anything happened at the summit to lead  American energy companies and other companies to believe that  Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of  taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our  primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not  only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd  like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're  convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to  support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of  Western governments have the financial resources over the next  decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private  sector can do that.                We look at our own society and we see tremendous  capability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very  good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial  investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new  technology and new capital to finance new production.                That's what the Russian government has told us it  wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis  on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on  the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently  last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President  Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong  signal to the American business community that we support their  efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex- Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to  support them.              Q   My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to  deliver on making Russia a more --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I  would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr.  Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas  sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice  President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the  barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil  and gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that  committee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to  the work.              Q   What type of mechanism is already in place to  administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will  the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of  the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the  Russian government for distribution at their will?                   SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking  about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the  program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working  through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure  that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to  the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the  Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can  account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of  months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of  these programs.              But they are all quite different.  For instance, in  the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it  is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of  the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working  through Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the  housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers,  we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the  democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian  private individuals and private foundations.  We're working with  journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have  noticed.              So we literally have here 30 to 40 different  activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be  carried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the  Russian government, some with Russian citizens.              Q   The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and  on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the  President has to do on that?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George  noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in  the relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's  fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we  return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and  we'll get back to the Russian government.              Q   You were not prepared for these questions when  you got here?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared  for these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not  prepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require -- let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require  consultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with  the American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those  concerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before  we take any action.              Q   Is this package designed so that you will not  have to go to Congress for anything at this point?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the  beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all  the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.   So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to  seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In  effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the  agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And  that's the advantage of this particular initiative.              Q   If this, as the President says, is a long-term,  long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment  heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to  Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are  prepared to go to Congress for various things?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been  clear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with  President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American  funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a  major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by  Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that  delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.   And we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where  it stands now.              Q   We've been told repeatedly that a number of  these items represent different or new ways of spending the money  already appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these  items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways  that it was not previously set to be?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've  said that these are all projects that either Congress had  allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were  some funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this  administration took office and had some new ideas about how the  funds might be expended.              We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or  the FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations -- Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to  further our programs.              And example of that is the Food for Progress  concessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of  funding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we  looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American  market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we  found it.              Q   Where, for example, are you getting the money  for this Russian officer resettlement --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the  Freedom Support Act funds.              Q   In other words, all of the money is being  directly spent in new ways, so to speak --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant  projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the  second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if  you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that  total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act  funding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year  '92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the  legislative history of those funds.              Q      cooperation --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I  don't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.              Q   Could you tell us please, has anything happened  here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and  Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's  happened here --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents,  President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this  issue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security  and arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's  session.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly  reinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been  talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple  of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the  discussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very  important negotiation that's been going on essentially between  Moscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially  discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute  to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.                But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend,  I don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.              Q?     Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is  any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current  year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been  earmarked and put it into this fund?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and  mirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We  could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included  out-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to  many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the  privatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already  talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.                We could have put in really big numbers and this  could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:   This package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're  going to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President  feels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy  that the western governments, the combination of governments, put  up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not  able to meet them, we're determined, and the President is  determined, to carry out every single program in this package.   And we'll do it.                But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's  part of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking  for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively  support reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment  on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.              Q      taken it way from any --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.   Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds;  so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in  Russia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.              Q   In terms of funding, there is no available  monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money  somewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I  don't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the  example is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit  guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay  back within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt  problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we  looked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement  for grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and  also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers  have a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply  look for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative  authority to do it.  This program has been successful in other  areas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union,  but we thought we should now.                 Q   Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package  for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by  initiatives put forward by President Bush?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think  that's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were  appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This  administration took office and inherited some obligations that  the Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven  week review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments  that had been made by the previous administration.                But we have gone well beyond them in funding the  enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not  been filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to  it.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them  into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say,  is another Clinton initiative.                Further, we listened to the Russian government and  listened to the Russian military who told us that the  resettlement of their officers was important to them for  political and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton  has responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment  that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out  a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.                I would also say that the President has given  impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly  about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we  have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends  itself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the  creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative,  we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private  sector as well as the American government, to achieve that  objective.                So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And  as most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the  last administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last  administration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton  assistance package for Russia.              Q   There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the  past has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this  outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money  will not just disappear because it's being administered by the  Russian government?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I  know that the President and other senior officials of our  government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and  that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's  intended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the  State Department will take great care in making sure that the  funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their  source.              I would not that this package is not simply a  package of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of  these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are  going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals,  with businesses.  The private enterprise support is another  example of that.              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add  a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one  area that we've been looking at very, very closely is  consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting  for these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely,  of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime  contractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of  a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that  funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in  Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent  efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.              Q   When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly  when do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President  is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think  it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over  the next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties  on May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over  the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach  out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us  to help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said  that we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate  in a much more effective way the activities of our own  government.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in  Russia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw  them together and to focus their efforts.              Q   Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will  actually be spent in the United States by American made goods?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any  figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something  up in the next couple of days on that.              Q   This figure is larger than the figure that has  been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result  of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think -- unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and  I'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put  us to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was  briefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the  intellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of  the ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we  had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have  been refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week  going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in  Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.   And so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been  together for about two weeks.              Q   Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There  was so much talk before about the President wanted to get  Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.   Is that in the out years?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.   President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance,  that support for the creation of private businesses is important  to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is  important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize  the state industries is important to them.                And so what we did was to try to make those the  centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We  listened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been  working with the Russian government for months on this trying to  work out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of  these programs was involved every step of the way.                But let me get at the other part of your question.   The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader  set of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking  for his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the  table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in  housing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to  consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other  allied governments that are also active.              Q   There's essentially nothing that happened in  the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that  you came in with?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular  package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks  ago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on  the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've  primarily talked about future, about what more the United States  and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia,  which is our base objective here.              Q   I noticed that you -- that money appropriated  to train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me  what about job training for workers who are displaced by  privatization?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we  have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and  financial services in the United States.  Part of the housing  initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain  Russian officers who are retiring into other professions.              Q      money for job training for workers whose  jobs are disappearing because of privatization --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet  allocated any money for that.              Q   Why not?              Q      of the $6 million is going to build 450  housing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the  Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do  housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework  of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've  got to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think  about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also  retraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming  out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.   We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers  as well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian  government.              Q      of the $6 million will go to retrain --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.              Q   Are you talking about apartment buildings or  single --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about  single, individual dwellings.              Q   You're saying that only 450 families will be  served by this?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I  thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.   What we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the  Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building  housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with  a huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next  couple of months and try to figure out with American  organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job  done.                I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.   And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into  this in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to  spend the money wisely.              Q   What is it about this program that convinces  you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be  in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back,  especially considering their other debt problem?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think  it's important to note that the United States on its own does not  have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.   It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to  our allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what  the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We  can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do  so, which is consistent with our national interests.              Q   Did the President say that the value of the  U.S. contribution was that it would create security and  prosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this  program that does this?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to  go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia,  and that is we want to do everything we can to support the  continuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay  in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear  forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction,  which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in  Russia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that  this program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we  have to make a long-term commitment to it.              Q   And then on the question of Russia's ability to  repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15  years from now?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian  government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping  is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve  their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency  revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years  from now to pay back those loans.              Q      substantial government-to-government loan  we've ever gotten into with the Russians?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to  answer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years  on this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because  the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to  just ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of  effort.              Q      government loans in any other sector that  you recall?  I know it wasn't done in --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair  to say this is a new and unique effort.\",\"Hey!

I was walking down the streets on our campus, and a beggar came up and asked me for any spare change I might have.

I talked of how great I felt that God had made such a pretty day, and how nice it was to give to people - she then said she was getting married soon. She talked about how she and her husband had very little (they may not have even had a house, for all I know), but that they felt a very special love in the Lord, an unselfish kind of caring.

We wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway.  You also need a tcp/ip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that's what they require to get the smtp gateway to work.  You need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff.  We do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do.    There is a glitch somewhere in the system though.  I don't know if it is MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to a Unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mail is routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail. Most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha. Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying \\\"Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)\\\".  If you can stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.

It would not    be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be    local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill    AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.    High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but    the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun    - and would pay through the nose for it.  Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude, homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of killing German soldiers for their guns.  Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible. The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel tubing, hand tools and a welder.

Thanks\",\"I've been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington,  I think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of  etymology.  I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my  childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes.   I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very  angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It  carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some  time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and  `Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To  become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would  consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared  to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a  better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable  riches of knowing Christ.  As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that  they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time  they had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They  didn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.   For example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.    When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her  death, she said to me, \\\"As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew.\\\"  What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a  Jew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with  matzoh balls.:-))   I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My  sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who  do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people  Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.  This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their  experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while  following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.    I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.   It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have  a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small  sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it  and do not want to ask for it back.  And while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.   I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the  Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is  that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again,  being rooted in the past.   This is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess  around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of  Easter).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.  I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all  believers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish  Christian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. \",\"Press Release No.19-93 Paris, 22 April 1993  Users of ESA's Olympus satellite report on the outcome of their experiments  \\\"Today Europe's space telecommunications sector would not be blossoming as it now does, had OLYMPUS not provided a testbed for the technologies and services of the 1990s\\\". This summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300 participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in Seville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).  OLYMPUS has been particularly useful : -      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of        new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small        antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested        data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,        distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few        examples.  -      in opening the door to new telecommunications services        which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-        frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over        Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.  -      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS        received for the first time in Europe, over several months,        high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and        then distributed it to various centres in Europe.  When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the world's largest telecommunications satellite; and no other satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.  OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some of the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite is given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or services; over the past four years some 200 companies and organisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over 100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning organisation.    As the new technologies and services tested by these OLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then make use of operational satellites such as those of EUTELSAT.\",\": > : >Well, at least I damaged my own bike.

About 20 years ago, _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips  in them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called \\\"Son o' God\\\" comics.  It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic, there were a  group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn, and when one of them said  the magic word, he turned into \\\"Son o' God.\\\" He went from a myopic,  curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied  portraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile  features.    Now, if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus,  and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this  NatLamp Jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since  this Jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.   This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim  that they are Christian. They profess faith in Jesus, but the Jesus  that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the  NatLamp Jesus was. \",\" : Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature  5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.  Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.  Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).  In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something.  Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature,  but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.    If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives, stick to the 10W40.  \",\" That's open for debate.

LOGICAL PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST'S RESURRECTION              1.  Jesus's enemies *would not* have stolen His                 body because that would have perpetrated the                 resurrection--the very opposite of what they                 desired.              2.  Jesus' disciples *could not* have stolen His                 body because Pontius Pilate established guards                 to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be                 stolen.              3.  Sadly (and ironically), many of Jesus' disciples                 did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus                 had risen from the dead.              4.  In nearly 20 centuries, no body has ever been                 produced to refute Jesus' assertion that He                 *would indeed* rise from the dead.\",\": >The Selective Service Registration should be abolished.

Mine already works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor I found  out which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility..   But I'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly little use..  2) Secondly, does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design of the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. (IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K) ??  3) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit ) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed... (Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I'm lazy 8)  4) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM on a PC (from a program written in Turbo C++)....   For instance, using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available from the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc... What I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the 1MB boundary...  I'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but I'll  suspect not ..   5) Also.. what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be re-entrant??????    As a follow on, does anyone have any comments about the use of DOS calls    0 to 0C from within a DOS interrupt? Ie will changing the stack size on    entry be of use.. Two articles I've read on the subject have given     conflicting views... Does anyone have any views on writing direct to    screen memory in terms of portability?\",\"Hi! I was wondering if anyone out there could help me. I have an error message that goes:    What does it mean?  I am running MS windows 3.1.  Thanks in advance\",\"  So, did the Jews kill the Germans?  You even make Armenians laugh.  \\\"An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the  systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of   the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at   least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. The   memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and   eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the U.S. in  1926 with the title 'Men Are Like That.' Other references abound.\\\"      (Rachel A. Bortnick - The Jewish Times - June 21, 1990)   Yes. To be exact, Armenians slaughtered 2.5 million Muslim people between  1914 and 1920.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of   Transcaucasia).  In 1920, '0' percent Turk.   \\\"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as   ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work   of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village.   Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts   into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable   and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets   completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for   howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the   scattered bones of the dead.\\\"                                Ohanus Appressian                             \\\"Men Are Like That\\\"                                    p. 202.

The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be depressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just about (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working correctly is totally drop safe.  Now, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single documented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because he failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely prevented the office from getting shot.  The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire. This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down intentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a 'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else. By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece. From the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of firing it.  The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be familiar with that particular type of firearm.\",\"posting for a friend 1982 porsche 928 new this vehicle was $74,000 today book list this vehicle between 11,500 to 15,000 perfect in every way with all options including new paint, leather interior, sunroof and low miles call (408) 264-4444 ask for frank and lets negotiate trades considered \",\"1.

The \\\"whole Russian strategy\\\" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano, who was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade  away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most notably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with Philly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will  necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a  great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly to the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by  injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered).

I think we'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is no \\\"option\\\" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs: there is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full '040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA). And there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other than the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one of the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be getting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't be able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040. It's not an \\\"option.\\\"     Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s thinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot recognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for a FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or something like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to replace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the full '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.\",\"I posted this a while ago and didn't recieve one reply, and now we have another bug report on the same subject.

OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.       141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site     sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite   (you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)  Merely \\\"anonymous FTP\\\" to either site on Internet and change to the appropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the \\\"bin\\\" command to make sure you're in binary.  OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North America....the following systems have a substancial supply of OTIStuff...  Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines  CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron  --------------------------------------------------------------   HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?                What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely    photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me (email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received, it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works are also welcome.  OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.   GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to  see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,   you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change     JPG files to a standard GIF format.   OTIS also accepts animation files.        When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You  can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of  emailing).  If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send copies to:  The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha, NE 68124-1113  I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.   Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named, include those as well.     Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please contact me and we'll arrange things.  If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\\\" disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back. This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP, but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or JPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather not have to.  At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to  get a slab-o-OTIS.  As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.   Email me for current archive size and directory.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTION?  The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the appropriate text files along with the images.     It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.  It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite BBS system....or even just post this \\\"info-file\\\" there.  It would be keen of you.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  USE?  If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory, you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or full address credit).  You will either find this in the \\\".rm\\\" file for     the image or series of images...or in the \\\"Artists\\\" directory under the  Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have  to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for  you, or give you their contact information.   When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  NAMING IMAGES?  Please keep the names of your files in \\\"dos\\\" format.  That means, keep the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or four digit \\\"code\\\" for the series of images, plus the series number. Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something like:    ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC  Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------   CREATING IMAGE FILES?  When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in case they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title, address or other information you'd like people to know.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  HMMM?!  That's about it for now.  More \\\"guidelines\\\" will be added as needed. Your input is expected.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS          (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,       or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations       however.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original         image files.  The files will go to the public at large.         It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone       could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.             Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS       takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights       revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to        give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed        electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed            all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is       NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or       broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not        limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,               screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific       permission for this sort of usage.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Remember, the operative term is \\\"stimulate\\\".

Wait a minute. S&K did NOT compare trends.  If they did, they would have seen that the advent of Canada's gun law had no effect on homicides, total or handgun.  Without a pre- vs. post comparison, one cannot speculate as to the utility of anything.  All they have is a correlation, and correlation DOES NOT prove causality.    Hold it again. You dismiss a point about demographics, then you ask about socio-economic demographics? Very slick.  Once again, correlation does not prove causality.  Looking at pre-vs. post data, the Canadian gun law had no effect.   Sir, if you were a Canadian, and owned a gun before the restrictive gun laws were passed, and decided to hide it rather than turn it in, would you answer truthfully a question about gun ownership from someone who calls, writes, or asks you on the street?  That is one problem with surveys.  Nobody will answer an incriminating question. Another is that people will often tell you what they THINK you want to here.   Does that mean no Vancouver citizens have handguns? I think not. You are discounting guns purchased beforehand, and guns purchased for purposes other than self-defense, which can also be used for defense.   He makes valid points about demographic differences.  You then resort to the kind of argument that the \\\"Politically Correct\\\" movement often uses to stifle any debate.  Nice, real nice.

Getting the court order to reveal the key *also* makes decipherable all *past* conversations (which may be on tape, or disk, or whatver), as I understand the proposal. I could be wrong, but I've seen no mention of \\\"session keys\\\" being the escrowed entities.  As the EFF noted, this raises further issues about the fruits of one bust leading to incrimination in other areas.  But is it any worse than the current unsecure system? It becomes much worse, of course, if the government then uses this \\\"Clinton Clipper\\\" to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption. (This is the main concern of most of us, I think. The camel's nose in the tent, etc.)  And it may also become much worse if the ostensible security is increased, thus allowing greater access to \\\"central office\\\" records by the government (the conversations being encrypted, who will object to letting the government have access to them, perhaps even automatically archiving large fractions...). This was one of the main objections to the S.266 proposal, that it would force telecom suppliers to provide easy access for the government.  One the government has had access to months or years of your encrypted conversations, now all it takes is one misstep, one violation that gets them the paperwork needed to decrypt *all* of them!  Do we want anyone to have this kind of power?  -Tim May, whose sig block may get him busted in the New Regime \",\" Probably we would have much the same problems with only a slight shift in emphasis.  Weekends might not be so inviolate (more common to work 7 days a week in a business), and instead of American Atheists, we would have similar, religious organizations.  A persons religious belief seems more as a crutch and justification for actions than a guide to determine actions. Of course, people would have to come up with more fascinating  rationalizations for their actions, but that could be fun to watch...  It seems to me, that for most people, religion in America doesn't matter that much.  You have extreemists on both ends, but a large majority don't make too much of an issue about it as long as you don't.  Now, admittedly, I have never had to suffer the \\\"Bible Belt\\\", but I am just north of it and see the fringes, and the reasonable people in most things tend to be reasonable in religion as well.      I don't bother according a higher value to my thinking, or just about anybodys thinking.  I don't want to fall in that trap.  Because if you  do start that, then you are then to decide which is better, says whom, why, is there a best, and also what to do about those who have inferior modes of thinking.

The purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and his angels.  To the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed, remember the Bible teaches that God has reserved them until the day of judgement.  Their judgement is soon to come.  Let me suggest this.  Maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it.

Adam    Adam Shostack            adam@das.harvard.edu\",\" I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a couple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not missing something obvious here...)  Basic Scenario:   I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of  files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users   connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public  key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the  one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The  result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it  is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the  machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed  system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal  private keys during the authentication sequence.  Questions:   Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any  information useful for a search give me any protection as far as  being coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)   It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am  assisting in \\\"entrapment\\\" (the users would send thier key anyway  and are not being enticed into doing something they would not  otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?   Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?  Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...  jim\",\"I am going to be getting a C650 soon, but I don;t want Apple  to come out with the Cyclones and the Tempest in a month and have the price drop on the system I want.

Further, the early church bears testimony to the impact.   Of course they knew where it was. Don't forget that Jesus was seen by both the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker. Pilate was no fool and didn't  need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus' body to  make it appear He had arisen. Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a  man well know to the Sanhedrin, to say that they didn't know where He was buried begs the question.  Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think on this a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a  deliberate lie!? If not, then why do you think the disciples would!? Now, I'm not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth,  but unbeknown to you, it is a lie. Many have done this. No, I'm talking about dying, by beheading, stoning, crucifixion, etc., for something you know to be a lie! Thus, you position with regards to the disciples stealing the  body seems rather lightweight to me.  As for graverobbers, why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over  the body of Jesus? He wasn't buried with great riches. So, again, this is an argument that can be discounted.  That leaves you back on square one. What happened to the body!?

I've never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists that he has, so I'd love to have a cite.   Wrong.  There's one gun design where that can happen, and it is supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber. (Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under the hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe manner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their trigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.   The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the described circumstance) is near zero.

Science has its basis in observable fact.   I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on the values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such, is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human activity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or ethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.  Bill  : If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must : first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering : the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  : So, back to the original question:  : And objective morality is.....?  This may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory. Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of people. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The concept supposedly described may have meaning however.  If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then He has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His existence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed, He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an objective sense. If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective. If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous, meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to meet that standard is therefore objectively determined. Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural norm, or the preferred conduct of \\\"decent\\\" people, making it seem subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard. Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe.

From  the writings  of tye biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian, she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish gene mix is dynamite.  Levon K. Topuzian Assistant Professor Northwestern University Skoie, Illinois.  TIME, December 21, 1992 'Letters'   You have set up straw horses and knocked them down. I'm not impressed. Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.   Source: Stanford J. Shaw, on Armenian collaboration with invading Russian armies in 1914, \\\"History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey (Volume II: Reform, Revolution & Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808-1975).\\\" (London, Cambridge University Press 1977). pp. 315-316.  \\\"In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city   of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population,   closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan   on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized   and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during   the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the  southern side of the lake.\\\"  \\\"Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,  Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.  Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First  World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse  to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other  invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian  success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of  Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common  soldiers began deserting in droves.\\\"  \\\"With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of  World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy  increased drastically.

They knew the pitchers needed some help or they would be watching the sunrise. :)\",\"  The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13).  And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the inevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are doing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is possible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the eyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing people for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and Annias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His plan might be accomplished.     But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to execute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to fulfill the chorus of \\\"Let his blood be upon our hands\\\" of the crowd in Jersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel, which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish other nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament.  Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, \\\"Mene, mene, tekel, peres?\\\"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's justice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians as their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the extirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel.  The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and the Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go on with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is quite clear. Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to question why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom, He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans 9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of Jesus Christ is as follows: \\\"Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.\\\"  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - \\\"Let the dead bury the dead, come, follow me.\\\"  There is not an infinite amount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to follow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, \\\"well, alright, you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your plans.\\\"  He said \\\"Follow me.\\\"  His message is NOT \\\"I'm just a sweety-pie who would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and Divine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale.\\\"  \\\"Our great God and Savior\\\" Jesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the world.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.\",\"VHS movie for sale.

Letting one's mind roam freely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of coming up with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis of the problem first.    Scientific intuition is not something one is born with.  It is something that one learns.  Maybe we don't understand completely how it is learned, but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the  key elements in developing it.    Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding new scientific ideas.  One thinks, for instance, of Darwin's naturalistic studies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for the  theory of evolution.    This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes empirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal exploration as important scientific work.  I agree that mere speculation does not deserve to be called science.  I also think that mere empirical studies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very poor kind of science.

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper- work, and left for the Zhdanov District. That's in Azerbaijan, near the Nagorno Karabagh region.  After the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically in Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said \\\"uprising\\\" in Azerbaijani, but I don't think it was really an uprising, just a  demonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the  Zhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even  women; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here,  and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There were some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the Armenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site. I was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew  wouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really  bad. I didn't know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me, \\\"There's unrest everywhere, be careful.\\\" Well I had a project going on. I told the Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on  and said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn't allow it, they  said, \\\"Nothing's going to happen to you, we've entrusted the matter to the  police, we've warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.\\\"  Well, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he  knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This man didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and  afterward he spent the night with us, too.  I sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, \\\"The situation is very tense, be careful.\\\"  We finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the morning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I shouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else's business travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it  and my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus,  they sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out  they knew what was happening in Sumgait.  I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is closed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the  buses aren't running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two minutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private drivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, \\\"Let's go find some other way to get there.\\\" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to take us to Sumgait.  He took us there. But the others had said, \\\"I wouldn't go if you gave me a thousand rubles.\\\" \\\"Why?\\\" \\\"Because they're burning the city and killing the Armenians. There isn't an Armenian left.\\\" Well I got hold of myself so I could still stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we  set off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, \\\"In fact there aren't any Armenians left. 'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them.\\\" Well  I was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me,  \\\"How old are you, old man?\\\" He wants to know: if I'm being that quiet, not  saying anything, maybe it means I'm an Armenian. \\\"How old are you?\\\" he asks  me. I say, \\\"I'm 47.\\\" \\\"I'm 47 too, but I call you 'old man'.\\\" I say, \\\"It  depends on God, each person's life in this world is different.\\\" I look much older than my years, that's why he called me old man. Well after that he was silent, too.  We're approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon. Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he was waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I'm sitting there with them, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant there were no Armenians with us.  I look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the  street, you know, and there's no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They stopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature  shafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .  Along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's  not. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I'm an Armenian, but I speak  their language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for  \\\"nut,\\\" or \\\"little nut,\\\" as \\\"pundukh,\\\" but \\\"fundukh\\\" is actually correct. The  pronunciations are different. Anyone who says \\\"pundukh,\\\" even if they're not  Armenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says,  \\\"There was a car there, with five people inside it,\\\" he says. \\\"They started  hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn't let the people out,\\\" he says, \\\"they wouldn't let them get out of the car.\\\" I only saw  the car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from Baku to Sumgait and back . . .  When they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there's a short guy, his eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. \\\"We're Azerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no Armenians here.\\\" He did come up to me when  we were pulling our things out and says, \\\"Maybe you're an Armenian, old man?\\\"  But in Azerbaijani I say, \\\"You should be ashamed of yourself!\\\" And . . . he  left. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had  to . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own  home.  They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that's where the Kavkaz store  and three large, 12-story buildings are. That's the beginning of down-town. I  saw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I  couldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it  was a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing  remained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I saw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About 30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.  I see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are closed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the crowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots. Several shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier.  Someone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the  soldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one  armored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning  off Sumgait.  I walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by  their gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. I joined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us and asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see. But I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly  recognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer people. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block. I can't get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as  to get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking  behind him. And he's shouting into a megaphone: \\\"Comrades, the Armenian- Azerbaijani war has begun!\\\"  The police have megaphones like that. So they're talking and walking around  the second microdistrict. I see that they're coming my way, and turn off  behind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings,  and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every corner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were  doing I can't say, because I couldn't get up close to them, I was afraid. But  the most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least find out if my children were alive or not . . .

Hudson, you are screwing up again.  Morality does not (I say again, DOES NOT) define only \\\"right and wrong\\\".

That is irrational thinking.    There may also be people out there who think that death by atomic  destruction is  a sublime and wonderful thing. I am not going to let them execute that idea just because they want to do it.   Simply because I let people make up their minds about what morals they have doesn't prevent me from spotting and stopping a madman when I see one, Hudson.  And even then, I will only stop him when he interferes  with me and my life.  That is the difference between me and you:  you want to interfere in people's lives even when they aren't affecting you.        /(hudson) /The central character in Dostoevsky's novel, Crime and Punishment,  /(R something or other) reasoned that if killed this old Jewish woman and /stole her money to educate and establish himself financially, he could /make a great contribution to society.  He reasoned that she was not of  /much profit to society.  She just collected rents, and hoarded money.   One of the central points of any (that's ANY) moral system is that is has to be internally consistent.    By killing her, the character had to accept the premise that the ends justify the means.  If he accepted that premise, then (in order to be consistent), he must accept the idea that some day another person may apply the same standard to HIS life.  Now, if he is unwilling to accept this premise (which he will not be willing to accept), then he has behaved inconsistently with his own moral standard.      /(me) /[football example deleted]  /(hudson) /Now suppose a freshman on the bench will only get to play if one of the /players in the field/on the court is injured (or killed.)

The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace based on Godism.  The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God, the fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God's providence of restoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the World's religions.  Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may miss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000 years ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish people of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that John the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even questioned who Jesus was: \\\"is he the one who is to come or do we look for another\\\". (see book of Matthew)   David Koresh didn't even come close.  The problem is that people like this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real Messiah when he does show up.   Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for Christians: How to recognize the Second Coming?  The Messiah should not claim to be God.  What sets a Messiah apart is that he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born sinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God originally intended.  God's restoration providence is still not complete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God's representative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one God.  ...    Who else in this world is claiming to be the Messiah.  Maybe he's already here.\",\" Radius speculated, publicly, that they could provide a PowerPC-based Rocket for existing Macs. It would have the plus of RocketShare and the minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator, NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.  Apple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except perhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC slot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC accelerators.  One potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with Rocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.  Apple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in existing 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking prices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen much cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.  First generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed CPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later. This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled for clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which I doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do this, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where Apple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup is in order.  By the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC, Pentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor front for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies. Also, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all the other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent right now.  Once anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market position will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it might). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome battle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not guaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of several.\",\" > Hi there,  > Can anyone tell me where it is possible to purchase controls found  > on most arcade style games.

On the non-pacifist side:]  (1) Killing to defend the innocent may be, if anything, _more_ justifiable than killing in self-defense.  I can turn my _own_ other cheek, but I have no right to turn someone else's.  (2) It seems to me that if Jesus had meant to teach pacifism, He would have made His position more explicit.  He didn't tell the centurion to leave the army, for instance; and the NT is full of military metaphors.  [B. On the pacifist side:]  (1) Apparently many early Christians refused to fight in the Roman army, or stated that one should refuse if given a choice.  But it's not clear whether they were objecting to war _per se_, or objecting to Roman policies.  (2) In modern warfare, it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only at combatants.  Bombing, both conventional and nuclear, kills lots of civilians.  (3) It's hard to tell whether any _particular_ war is justified at the time.

No experimental result should be accepted unless it is described in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications do indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and reasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.  But people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy reasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a large part of the history of science.

For example, quarks are an accepted part of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What would be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical reality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could lie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of experimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.  (I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though. I don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather directly verifying the existence of qi.)  2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational experiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and interpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical controversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall, there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations, petty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which computations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical function of science: results don't count unless they can be replicated.  The whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate part can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.  Pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals; but even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed; that when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate polarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was indistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur's irrational motivation had led to a replicable, and important, result.  This is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their theories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not concede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress the results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they think supports their position (creationists).\",\"I am in charge of purchasing some computer software for a small office and I have a few question about Microsoft's Office Pack.    1)  I was wondering, are the programs that are packaged with the Office Pack--WinWord, Power Point, Excel, and ccMail--complete and the latest addition?  2) Are the programs \\\"hobbled\\\" in any way?   3) Can we update single programs at a latter date ( i.e. from Excel 4.0 to Excel 5) ?  4) Do you receive all of the necessary disks and documentation?  5) Is there anything that I should be aware of that makes the Office Package less of deal that it seems?

The surest route to disaster.  It's amazing, people never seem to learn from history (or common sense).  Price controls do not, and cannot work.

Few people know that the Pilgrims originally tried to have common property to grow food and a common food store.  Many people know the hardships they suffered the first few winters because of it.  After arriving, the Pilgrims made all property common.  They all shared in the work and the resulting crops went into a common store.  After much debate the new Governor Bradford privitized the land; assigning plots to each family.  According to Perry D. Westbrook:  \\\"The change was immediately justified by the increased industry of the inhabitants and by the larger acreage planted.\\\"  experience that was had in this common course and condition, tried sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the vanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some of later times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community into a commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiser than God.  For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed much confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort.\\\"  Bradford did not blame this failure on the \\\"strangers\\\", but on the basic selfishness in all men.  He wrote \\\"seeing all men have this corruption in them, God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them.\\\"  In other words, according to Westbrook, \\\"Bradford found private enterprise to be the most suitable economic policy for mankind in its fallen state.\\\"  Let's not make the same mistake that the Pilgrims made.

I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience can be trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something so materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess anything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were discussing the \\\"mind\\\" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal, as it were; and half spiritual.   ?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the ?possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do ?not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of ?Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage ?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know ?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This ?is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,           Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.   ?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain ?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain.  This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method.   ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?\\\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some ?

This message is a summary of the responses. Thanks to all of you that replied.    a) The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only, as far as I know.  The VLB    and EISA version should have no problems.   b) I'm pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn't    work in systems with over 16M Ram.  There is supposed to be way    of switching the \\\"memory aperture\\\" feature off to prevent this,    but apparently it doesn't work.  I posted some \\\"help me\\\" messages    on the net and people indicated that the EISA card didn't have this    problem.  c) FALSE  d) The VLB card, which I have, allows you to set memory aperture over 32M    by using their configuration software.  No messing with jumpers necessary.     The 32M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards.    a) Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM    (EISA and VLB) or 12 M (ISA).  32M should not be a problem for you.    b) Dunno.  c) Depends on the bus. YES if ISA, NO if EISA or Localbus    a) Nope.  I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all    non-interlaced.  b) Yes - According to PC Magazine, they've tested a local bus version    that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced.  c) Not for the Pro. Sometimes for the Plus.     Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. This has nothing to     do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. Note that for 24 bit color    and Windows you MUST have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding.    a) They aren't perfect, but are much improved.  I don't recall the last time which    I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due    to software incompatibility.  b) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54.  c) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain    graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they    do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..    other accelerated cards also have bugs.  d) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than    satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my    NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.     I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond    Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on    the old driver.    a) It's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.   b) Yes - I'll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what    I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)    every 20 minutes or so...  c) Depends on many many things.    a) I like it.  b) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is.  c) Yes, this appears to be true :-)  d) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are    coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.    Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer     at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was     developing at that time.  (PC Magazine, about two months or so back)     Overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- That is the end of the questions.

(Much thanks to Jayne K who is already supporting me with kind words and prayers!)  I've been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs.  I'm female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that on seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this company.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one; someone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.  I'm really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.  There was no note.  I do not know if it was:   - someone's idea of an innocent joke, that went awry  - someone's sick idea of flirting  - an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)  I dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question, I don't know the answer so I take a military specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a Bible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to Corinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love Association?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.  I can lock up my desk, but I can't lock up every book I have in the office.  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into my briefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home to find such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone wants to do to my body.  To make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for leaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go to the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one could be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my number was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a neutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite the fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer.  I need some prayers --- I can't stop crying. I am so deeply wounded that it's ridiculous.  I feel like I'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel like I'm a sub-human piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simple phone call saying \\\"We're leaving for Mary's lunch a little early so that Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting...\\\"  Please pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously turned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing me so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray for my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a whole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This company, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment isn't tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or threatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven times in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company do me no good when I'm terrified or healing from the latest assault.)  And please pray that I don't turn into an automaton because of this. That's my bad habit: \\\"ignore it and it will go away\\\", \\\"you're not worth anyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this\\\", \\\"you're right, you are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this way\\\", \\\"you are just an object\\\", \\\"you prostitute your mind to this company so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there as well?\\\", \\\"what makes you think women aren't just possessions, and nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\\\" This is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major depressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don't come into my head and stay there, triggering depression.  Please pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and God. In a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to God, and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesn't drop me from his loving hand, but it's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand, look down, think I'm falling and forget that God's still holding on to me.)  Although this probably isn't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup, I really can use the kind of loving support you all provide.  For this reason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence.  After all, he's allowed me the thermometer note, and a few other off-the-wall topics.

If you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent.  However, if a professional thief wants your vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:  1) ignition kill or fuel cut-off 2) a flashing red LED  These two are basic to a decent alarm system.   To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock. That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target. But, then there's always car-jacking.   Why is life so confusing?

So there's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a given context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely and makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other hand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which eventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  \\\"You people call THIS science?\\\"   (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)    Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor appropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is  ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science.     My second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this is true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.  Within mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before the twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later  mathematicians did prove them, of course.)    I think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not so much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a  matter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of  incompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to  objectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an essential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step  of the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward  that goal then one is not doing science.)  When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and seems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further investigation.     Admittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable amount of effort in a \\\"serious scholarly investigation\\\" such as I suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately  specific question to try and answer.    The \\\"science\\\" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science  currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.   I certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use  of \\\"reason and observation.\\\"  One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.    Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with the study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there  is any existing research related to this question.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"BOAT For SALE 1989 23' IMPERIAL FISHERMAN featuring         Walkaround Cuddy Cabin, 305 V8 with VOLVO DUO PROP OUTDRIVE /\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/ AM-FM Cassette Stereo, VHF RADIO, 4x6 HUMMINGBIRD Fishfinder, ALL  Safty equipment, Covers, and MUCH MORE.           18000 LB.

Blackman, Research Coordinator for NRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89. -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear sir:  By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of  momentus \\\"scientific\\\" findings. These are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings. Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists.  The latest effort -- \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities,\\\" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying  editorial, \\\"Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,\\\" by two employees of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular order.   1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to   support the statement that \\\"some have argued that restricting  access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate  of homicide.\\\" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that  contention.    2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very  similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,  demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities  are very different with very different demographic characteristics  which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in  Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white  and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be  the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-  grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various  ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.    3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,  compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all  the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect  in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-  1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth  involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM  article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving  handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that  one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding  that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that  a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day  for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without  at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?    4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national  gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily  selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because  it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific  reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which  involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar \\\"control\\\"?  Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite  \\\"scientific\\\" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide  rate *exceeds* that of such \\\"wild west\\\" cities in Texas as  El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado  Springs. (Ref. 3)    5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or  handguns \\\"are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in  Vancouver.\\\" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending  to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is  an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry  permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in  Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of  handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun  owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number  of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns  for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns  legally for protection, registration figures are  meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York  City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,  that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population  in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver  has a greater \\\"prevalence of weapons\\\" than New York City.    The second method of measuring gun density is \\\"Cook's gun  prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity  differences.\\\" But the validation was by Cook of his own  theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a  different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is  based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement  in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking  a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide  (42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in  homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in  Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-  ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and  Vancouver.    6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and  Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that  Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to  the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian  law for owning and carrying handguns for personal  protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more  difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually  the case.    7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain  the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the  penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of   clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a  firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number  of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making  arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest  rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences  imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,  or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social  scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,  the authors of the NEJM \\\"tale of two cities\\\" fail even to mention  most factors related to crime control.    8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective  means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not  the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost  650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from  criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the  liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be  completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury  to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors  reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides  without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle  accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides  involving firearms.    9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the \\\"study,\\\"  editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it \\\"applied  scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb  advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly  handguns.\\\" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly  be mistaken for \\\"scientific methods\\\" by a sociologists or  criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle \\\"study\\\" is the equivolent  of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding  two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25  and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,  administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while  giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure  and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure,   announcing in a \\\"special article\\\" a new medical breakthrough.  It would be nice to think that such a \\\"study\\\" would neither be  funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.    Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC  make them willing to present shoddy research as \\\"scientific  breakthroughs\\\" in \\\"special articles\\\" and editorials relating  to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying  the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight  over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about  the distortions contained in \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,  and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities\\\" and \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call  for Science.\\\" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside  whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize  an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.

Wright           (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)     suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\\\"  The problem is demonstrated    by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting    to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by    the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal    of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and    suggested that a handgun ban \\\"may reduce the rate of homicide in a     community.\\\"       The nine medical doctors who published \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime,    Assaults, and Homicide\\\" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite    many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver    has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations    make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems    indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period    1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.    Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,    Why?       The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case    to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,    that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their    evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and     unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point    does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support    of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody    knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We    are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that    a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates    when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.       Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two    indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-    weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons    permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the    permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable. *     The second bit of evidence is \\\"Cook's gun prevalence index,\\\" which stands *  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index *  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in  *  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage *  of homicides and suicides involving firearms. *     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides, *  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take *  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be *  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides *  is directly related to their relative availability in the general  *  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To *  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to \\\"prove\\\" it on the basis of *  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.       Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that    guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.    The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun    ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates    reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,    that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.       In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of    violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the     consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin     Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime    for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke    an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.       Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data    on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are \\\"similar in    many ways,\\\" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law    stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish    the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that \\\"all    else is equal\\\" among things being compared. *     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look  *  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime *  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage *  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle *  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent. *  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the *  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half- *  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown *  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out. *     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is *  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates *  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide *  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver. *  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due *  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks, *  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics *  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison *  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial *  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle *  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain *  in either city.       Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the    cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority     groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in \\\"gun availability\\\"    (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not    matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why    blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed    in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,    do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)       Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between    Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have     anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol     abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city    of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the     Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the    United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian    percentage?       The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many    ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent    more detailed analysis, nearly any of these \\\"many ways\\\" might explain part    or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such    as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal. *     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide *  result in a \\\"complex picture.\\\"  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing *  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They *  also acknowledge that \\\"socio-economic status is probably an important *  confounding factor in our comparison,\\\" remarking further that \\\"blacks    *  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of *  Vancouver's population.\\\"  Given the evidence presented in the article, *  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle *  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial *  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility, *  since \\\"detailed information about household incomes according to race *  is not available for Vancouver.\\\"       The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in     gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple    example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms    of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one     would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.    Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce     crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into    account?  In this example, the \\\"hidden variable\\\" is city size: Guns are    more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city    problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the    appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very    seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities    for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,    and their results are impossible to interpret.       In the editorial \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science\\\" accompanying    the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the    authors for applying \\\"scientific methods\\\" to a problem of grave public    heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from    nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate    plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them    out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are    little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this    study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical    identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--    is cause for further concern.

What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith (i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal revelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God  must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would  honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone  who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are  rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient  for them, or because they wish to spurn God.  I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one  holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is  that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with God.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or  revealed that truth.    --  comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\",\" It just occurred to me why the algorithm is secret.

I will make the case here though and try to help you out:  8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9).  Yes, it is by God's grace and our faith that we are saved.  We are not saved by what we do.  However,  15 If ye love me, keep my commandments. (John 14:15).  Keeping Christ's commandments is a \\\"work\\\" per se, and a demonstration of our love for him.  Also,  6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. 7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? 8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: 9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. (Luke 13:6-9).  Again,  16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. (John 15:16).  It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit.  What is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being love, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest in the actions that we carry out.  If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things Christ commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith.  Asking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your pants is more important.  Good works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith, true faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs commands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit, then we shall be uprooted just like the tree.   It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for days about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a building and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you all day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really don't have that faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the test.  Words and talk mean nothing.  I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but this should be sufficient.  Hope it helped.

Admittedly this was many years ago when I was young.  Since then I just make sure I don't get stung.  I also should carry a bee sting kit with me, but I don't.    This isn't scientific or proof, but this would lead me to believe it's not a different reaction, just a different degree of reaction.  Allergies work that way.  People have various reactions.  Sort of like diabetes, some people can get by with just monitoring their diet, others have to monitor their diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their diet like a hawk and use insulin regularly.    I think MSG is probably similar...some people have allergic reactions to it.  Some people are allergic to fermented things and can't use soy sauce...but the chinese have been using it for centuries... that doesn't necessarily mean that it's safe for everyone.  \",\" The fantasy was that he had found something of fundamental importance to one of the hot questions of the day ('77).  He really had very little reason to believe it, other than raw hope.  By fantasy, I certainly don't mean Velikovskian manias.   I'm not familiar with the history of this experiment, although, arguably, I should be.   I think that it is enough if his contemporaries found the result surprising. That's not what I'd quibble about.  What I'd like to know are Toricelli's reasons for doing his experiment; not the post hoc _constructed_ reasons, but the thoughts in his head as he considered the problem.  It may be impossible to know much about Toricelli's thoughts; that's too bad if it is so.  One of Root-Bernstein's services to science is that he has gone rooting about in Pasteur's and Fleming's (and other people's) notes, and has discovered some surprising clues about their motivations.  Pasteur never publicly admitted his plan to create mirror-image life, but the dreams are right there in his notebooks (finally public after many years), ready for anyone to read.  And I and my friends often have the most ridiculous reasons for pursuing results; one of my best came because I was mad at a colleague for a poorly-written claim (I disproved the claim).  Of course, Toricelli's case may be an example of a rarety: where the fantasy not only motivates the experiment, but turns out to be right in the end.

In my encounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth.  According to them, their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of God and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way. Their way is the 'truth.'  But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason, but it seems to me a choice.  My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when I was in grade school:  A kid would say, \\\"All policemen are jerks!\\\"  I'd ask, \\\"How do you know?\\\"  \\\"Because my daddy told me so!\\\"  \\\"How do you know you're daddy is right?\\\"  \\\"He says he's always right!\\\"  Well the argument usually stops right there.  In the end, aren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as false?  -------------  This is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I apologize if I'm covering tired old ground.  Some of the discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome any comments.  --   [I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  I can understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough evidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for other religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of intelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that doesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who believe Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict it are false.  This suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than the Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where people choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent spiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in some unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of one sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But Christianity is in its essense a \\\"historical\\\" religion.  That is, it's based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out there, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways, and that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \\\"mundane\\\" world, we are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it falls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The Christian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual external reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know everything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that implies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't see how else we could proceed.  This needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking with people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and even if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.\",\"The Roman Catholic conservatives are coming out in the open to line up with Pat Robertson and his ultra Right Wing Christian Coalition. Former Secretary of Education William Bennet, a Roman Catholic, stood beside the Christian Coalition's spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 3 conference in Washington.  The purpose of the conference was to publish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed to prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it backed away from the \\\"Family Values\\\" positons of the '92 convention.  Conservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson's organization with political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications support.  The Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version of the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes. Ms. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom Council in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.  Ms. Elwell was hired by Domino's Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989 to manage Legatus, a \\\"nonpolitical\\\", Catholic businessmen's group. Membership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4 million in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts at Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the Catholic Campaign.  The Campaign's list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep. Robert K. Dornan, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, the lovely Pat Buchanan and Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus.   Also on the national committee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice.  Another Catholic, Thomas Patrick Monaghan, senior counsel of Robertson's ACLJ, is also an active supporter of the Catholic Campaign.  The board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare, broadcasting exec and former U.S. ambassador to the Pope, Wall Street executive Frank Lynch, former Reagan official Richard V.

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call Japan, etc.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would greatly appreciate your sending it to me.

He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19).  However, if he enjoyed punishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus to \\\"seek and save that which was lost\\\" (Luke 19:10)?  You asked for it.  2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished. Matthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in God's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity. 2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the disciples \\\"will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord\\\". 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth being condemned. Revelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes and those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in the \\\"fiery lake of burning sulfur\\\". Revelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast \\\"will be tormented with burning sulfur\\\" and there being \\\"no rest day or night\\\" for them because of it. Psalm 9:17:  \\\"The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that forget God.\\\"  I think those should be sufficient to prove the point.   Joe Fisher  [In the following I'm mostly playing \\\"devil's advocate\\\".  I'm not advocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that it's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible to see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often uses the term \\\"second death\\\".  The most obvious understanding of that would seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks both of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms that can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince you of one view or the other, but to help people understand that there's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to understand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire, whatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35 implies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably they just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to  understand this passage in a non-literal way.)  2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them in hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.  Matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is eternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever. Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been prepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the eternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet will be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being thrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \\\"the second death\\\". This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as the devil, and humans?  2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \\\"everlasting destruction\\\"? This is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be understood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in eternity.  2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction. Revelation 21:6-8: see comment above Revelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there, it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says that the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that  there is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people are tormented forever.  Psalm 9:17:  I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.\",\"Has anyone had problems with Ami Pro 3.0 after running PCTools (v7.1) compress?

The basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on the biblical text.  Luke's account is highly suspect (I would refer you to the hermeneia commentary on Acts).  Moreover Luke's account is written at least 90 years after the fact.  In the meantime everyone he mentions has died and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established. Moreover, Pauls account of some of the events in Acts (as recorded in  Galatians) fail to establish the acts accounts.

Yes!  So were their non-Christian contemporaries (the more familiar you are with late Republican Rome or the Pricipate, the weirder those people will seem -- forget the creative filtering done by Renaissance and Eighteenth Century hero worship.)  So are modern non-Christians.  And Christians.  You are pretty weird, yourself, with your rather acid dismissal of Luther and of Protestantism -- and in apparently buying into a simplistic propaganda model about Catholicism *not* being faddish.   Sure, it's so large that global fads take longer cycles than they do in smaller denominations (and local ones are not usually visible unless you do a lot of traveling to exotic lands :-)).  May I recom- mend, as a salutary antidote to this nonsense Philippe Aries' book _The Hour of our Death_, a longitudinal study of death customs in  Western [specifically Catholic] Christendom?  And it won't help to escape into the obscurity of the first Christian century.  Paul was pretty weird, too; as were Peter and the others in the (apparently quite weird) circle around Jesus.  What I think you might find helpful is a bit more charity -- try to understand these weirdos and nutcases with the same respect and love you would expect others to show YOUR notions.  We *are* commanded to love one another, after all.  And Brown's book is, in fact, a heroic attempt to SEE the groupings he talks about as motivated in love and the gospel and their social contexts.  (If anything, Brown is *too* heroic here -- he manages to overstrain himself at times :-))  I don't suggest that we *follow* any of these old cult paths -- and it raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much of early Christianity *was* like the weird (Christian and non-Christian) cults we see today.  To that extent, I think you raise a serious problem (and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self-deprecatory and ironic.)  But the first principle for *answering* these questions is respect and love for those we do not understand.  And it helps to *work* at under- standing (as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and begin to withdraw our respect for them as people.)  I would advise, in other words, MORE historical reading (Brown's other books are also good, most especially his bio. of Augustine; also try Robin Lane Fox's _Christians and Pagans_, maybe the Paul Veyne ed. _History of Private Life_, some of Foucault's books on sexuality in the ancient world ...)

This is   a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had   any problems with it.    It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than    a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better    suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non   competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.   You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear   changes.      The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike   very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot).  There is a   custom made carbon/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect   the engine cases and the water pump.  The steering angle has been reduced    by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. This with the suspension tune-up   by Phil Douglas of Aftershock (Multiple time ISDE rider) gives it a better   ride than most bike: plush suspension, responsive steering with no head shake.\",\"I was wondering if the FAQ files could be posted quarterly rather than monthly.

I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in \\\"contraceptive technology\\\" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.    Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't we teach \\\"safe drug use\\\" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it because we know that a class in \\\"how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs\\\" would increase drug use?  Why isn't \\\"drug abstinence education\\\" barred from schools because it teaches \\\"religion\\\"?  Aren't we abandoning those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe use?  \",\"Does anybody have a GIF of the Tiger Stadium seating chart?

There is an option (BIOS I think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to CPU/VL bus transactions.  This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives the VL bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'.  These particular wait(s) are applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus device(s).  You want to enable these wait(s) only if you are using a 50-DX with VL bus devices.  This is from reading my motherboard manual, and these are my interpre- tations.  Your mileage may vary.

Assuming that there is an absolute morality, two disagreeing  objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right; there is no room for compromise.

Today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique I'd never seen before.  He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil. The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray, made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.  In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.  On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.  Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises and concerns me are:  1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?  2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color     (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring     agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected     it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,     caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being     used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?  3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated     as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract     from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever     happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea     could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do     so.  WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens), I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips, getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process, then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.  My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff, just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?  I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.  And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually has some standing, don't know about the others.\",\" My Beckman died a few days ago, thanks do about a 4 or 5 foot drop onto a lab table.  !@#!@$#!@$@#$  Probably not indicative of anything, but I've already filled out the requisition for a Fluke 87. :-)  Oh yeah, and sometimes our measurements here do count.

I haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a couple of things jumped out at me.  First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of weapon used in self defense.  1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to \\\"weapon.\\\" The second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w/gun defenses reported *fell* by almost 25%.  Unless there's an explanation for this, I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going  ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time.        Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, and not just a reporting difference?

It seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment, will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it is a part of it.     Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them within their borders?    [...]  You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade? Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes she had, however, is  the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians are attacking Azeri  towns.  Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  going to cause incessant skirmishes.  Think of 10 or 20 years down the  line -- both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe the other out.  These people will be neighbors, would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal?  If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of their blood and future.  It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.

One time a friend of mine at Sun sent me an e-mail.  He composed it using the Sun OpenWindows 3 \\\"mailtool\\\" which handles (non-MIME) \\\"attachments\\\" and the like.  Since I don't use \\\"mailtool\\\", I had to manually save it, cut & paste, and then \\\"uudecode\\\" the actual attachment.  What I got - after a not-inconsiderable amount of time spent doing this - was an audio file.  The original message was over 32Kb of mail headers and uuencoded data; the resulting audio message was a single sentence that I transcribed as a 135 character message.  If he had sent me the sentence in plain text, the e-mail would have been around 250 bytes, and it would have taken me about 3 seconds to process it at most.  Instead, it was 32k and it took at least a minute.  A complete waste of (my) time and bandwidth, as far as I'm concerned.  Sending plain text is still the most efficient method of transmission, given the same transport mechanism.

I made a decision to accept the truth-claims of Christianity after having given it a lot of thought.

Also, my Calvinist should rest assured that I don't lay any of the responsibility for the outcome [my conversion] on anyone but God.)

I grew up in the shadow of [generic authoritarian conservative denomination], and I *knew* that that wasn't a way of life that I could adopt.

That's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you want one, you are still innocent until proven guilty.  Cops are not the only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes, anyone who witnesses a crime can do so.  Go to the Highway Patrol and explain the situation, give them a description of the car and the license number, and tell them the specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute (ie, search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy).  Fill out the ticket and sign it.  It will go through the same system any ticket a cop writes goes through.  If contested, you will have to appear in court to prosecute.

I have a IIsi that came with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.   First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for over two months.  The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of shorts or bad connections.  Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again, and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not damaged, and I can go back to the original setup.  Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this day.   In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal should be terminated at all the ends.

You know, Sam, when people start talking about an International Jewish conspiracy, its really begins to sound like anti-Semitic bull.   The reason there is no conspiracy here is quite simple. Zionists made no bones about what was going on.  There were conferences, publications, etc, all talking about creating a National home for the Jews.    [...]   Because you've never heard of it, its dead?  The fact is, you claimed Israel had to give arabs rights because of (non-existant) International aid.  Then you see that that argument has a hole you could drive a truck through, and again assert that Israel is only democratic within the (unexplained) constraints of one ethnic group. The problem with that argument is that Arabs are allowed to vote for whoever they please.  So, please tell me, Sam, what constraints are there on Israeli democracy that don't exist in other democratic states?   I've never heard anything about the Khazakistani arab population.  Does that mean that they have no history or roots?  When I was at Ben Gurion university in Israel, one of my neighbors was an Israeli arab.  He wasn't really all that different from my other neighbors.  Does that make him dead or oppressed?     How recent is recent?  I can probably build a case for a Jewish Gaza city.  It would be pretty silly, but I could do it.  I'm arguing not that Jerusalem is Jewish, but that land has no ethnicity.

We were there to discuss SSTO, and commercial space.  This is how it went...    After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO, I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard the gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour. Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.  We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide, who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to  make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.  Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening. We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.   Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that we brought up.  But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space. So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to LEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming  feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that. We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog over L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is  more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to  understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education  whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday  would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.  We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided in those sectors.  Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc.. We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.  We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.  We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan), and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to LEO.  In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data  Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it. He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it, and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually happen immediatly there.  The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who really did know the answers.  Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this would be something that she would be very interested in, although they do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the state 1 week out of 6 these days.  All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\",\"+ +I know of no law, either on the books or proposed, that bans motorcycles +from any place that i want to go to.  Many private places ban bikes.  For example, the famous 17 mile drive at the Monterrey Peninsula.  And I have stayed at resorts that sported a \\\"No motorcycles allowed\\\" sign at the entrance.  And there have been public places.  Call the AMA and ask for Jim Bensberg (sp?) or any one else in their Legislative Office. They will recound the many public places that they had to bring to court to reverse their ban on bikes.  That includes everything from public parks to full cities.  There are probably a few fights on their books as we now speak.  That is another good reason to donate to their legislative fund. ____________________________________________________________________________    Death is life's way of telling you you've been fired  -- R. Geis\",\"or there   Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.  The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was because of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by scanning this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines).  When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \\\"I want to play a mono sound\\\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted the documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound.  Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from the IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.  Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware, and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase works. On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra 700/900/950 at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel only. Both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification, but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.  If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their games will only come out the left on some games.  The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related. It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what machine you have.  Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list: and also Hellcats, Super Tetris Oxyd (and many more, these are just what I've tested)  Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.   Other games you list: and also PGA Tour Golf Civilization (and more, these are again only from personal experience)  Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.  The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT! Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to do, but I'm going say it anyway. Stop cheating on sound! Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period is about to end. The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will work even better soon, so use it.  In conclusion: To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug. To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all hardware.   Have fun.  Disclaimer number 1: I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed. So don't write me with sound questions.  Disclaimer number 2: If it says up above that I wrote anything like \\\"the grace period is about to end\\\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.  Disclaimer number 3: I don't speak for Apple, just me.\",\" Not quite correct.  Biblical teaching expects us to celebrate the resurrection of Christ not once a year but every time someone is baptized.  Col. 2:12-Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.\\\"  Rom. 6:4-Therefore we are buried with him in baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\\\" Those really want to celebrate the resurrection should by faith walk in newness of life after baptism.  It is not necessary to celebrate a pagan goddess in the process.  Paul answered your question in Romans 9.  In v. 4 he stated that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the promises were given to the Israelites.  It is a package deal.  He goes on to identify those who are true Israelites.  Vs 6-8 makes it plain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way but those who accept the promise of God.  Paul continued to emphasize that he was an Israelite in 2 Cor. 11:22, then in Gal 3:29 he says that all those who belong to Christ are Abraham's seed, and heirs to all the promises given to the Israelites.  The promises come with the law.  It is all or nothing.  Why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law?  Certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you.  Or do you believe that adultery is no longer forbidden?  Same law.  BTW  please give a reference for your statement that the Gentiles are only required to observe the basis commandmants.

In splicing them    together it is not my intention to change Steve's meaning or misrepresent   him in any way.  I don't *think* I've done so. ]   Part of what started this was my earlier example of Illinois, USA requiring anyone doing more than X automobile transfers a year (X = 10, I think) to become licensed as a used car dealer.

Steve, let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resell cars.

You can use your money to fix up that car.  Since it is your car, you can sell that car.  Your life is truly yours; it belongs to you.  It matters not if someone thinks that it's \\\"wrong\\\" for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 months rather than, say, 9 cars.  They may dissaprove, but it is not their life or their money, it is your life and your money.  My money is truly mine; it belongs to me.  I can use it to buy a car. Perhaps your car.  Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewhere dissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying.  That someone could go to the government and insist that the government make us stop it.

The question you ask is complicated and deserves an honest answer. I am going to provide one from my own current perspective, not a historical one.  Currently, as a non-observant jew/Israeli/American, my own feeling is that Jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in Palestine or Israel, than the palestinians or Israelis (both arab and jew) do. With regard to Jewish Israelis, they should have the same rights in Israel as do all other Israelis.   Who are them?  If by them you mean the non-religious Jews, I think you should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their supporters are religious.  The other part of the problem is, to my knowledge, not that the palestinians don't want to be a part of Israel, as much as they would accept (for the most part) being full citizens of Israel, with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded Israeli citizens.

The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue first, and only using SetValue if the required location is different. The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the location of the popup, so that the SetValue really does change the location of the popup.

Unless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys from men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex (due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the children from abuse by members of the *same* sex.

I agree there may be other villages where the civilian population has deserted because it is too close to Israeli lines and thus gets bombed more often.  In such villages often the only remaining  inhabitants are guerillas and some elderly who have nowhere else to go. But for the most part the typical South Lebanon village is more like mine.  One where civilians and guerillas live together.  They are often inhabiting the same house.  Many families are large, some have members of the families involved in Hizollah, most others are not.  That is what is so hard of South Lebanon, Israel is not fighting an army with well drawn battle lines, but a guerilla tyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blends with the local populace.  Not because they are evil cowards that use women and children as shields, but because that is the only way one can fight a more powerful better equipped occupying army.   Hizbollah and Amal are now the main two militias.  Though Hizbollah people tend to be more committed to resistrance operation and better motivated by religious conviction.    As to retaliation,  It may be a mixture of what we both say.  Sometimes Israel chooses its targets carefully.  At other times it just sends its pilots on sorties aimed at a town in general since it only knows that the  attackers came from that specific village but has no further intelligence.  On several occasions Israel retalliated against  civilian refugee camps, even in North Lebanon, just to show that it will not sit idly after its soldiers have been attacked. Most of the time it directs the SLA to do the dirty work and indiscriminately shell some Lebanese villages on the other side. I have experienced this shelling myself on several occasions, this is why the SLA militia is sometimes even more despised than  Israeli troops.   I hope you are right on Israeli willingness to withdraw, but I still contend that withdrawal would be the better course for Israel's security, since it would reduce its  military losses, and I claim that the Lebanese and Syrian gov'ts would be able to prevent any  further attacks on Northern Israel.     Hmm...  Here we disagree on what serves Syria interests better. I think Syria wants to have Lebanon all to itself.  It would be willing to guarantee Northern Israel's security in return for Israeli withdrawal.  I don't think Syria wants Israel to be involved in its protectorate of Lebanon.  Syria is sitting at the negotiating table because it has come to accept that and wants to get a political resolution.  A renewal of hostilities along the Lebanese front could put the whole ME peace negotiations back in question.

Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple (early March).  Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is it because too many people take French and German in college to make the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance. Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.   For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.  Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.   Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care.  At that point, they wouldn't even consider a \\\"voucher\\\" approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.   It is \\\"free\\\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda.  The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer  1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For  1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance. Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.   Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.  When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's public health insurance plan.  gld\",\"   The commercial uses of a transportation system between already-settled- and-civilized areas are obvious.  Spaceflight is NOT in this position. The correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the long transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn't require gov't to fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit at the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private. But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.   I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop, and large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you ask me for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, I can't give them.  We just don't know enough.  The launch rate demanded by existing space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, and we are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries will be, when they will practical, how much will have to be invested to start them, etc. \",\"I'm having an X resource problem using Brian Wilson's wscrawl 2.0 (a wonderful interactive conferencing program, by the way).

Ahola had only played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points); it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be ... Peter Ahola.  #24 DOUG WILSON  Season: 16th Acquired: '91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and   2nd round pick in '92 entry draft Grade:  I (B)  I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out. Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which, unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for 2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be Wilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.  #29 DEAN KOLSTAD  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (C-/D+)  It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games, he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.  #38 PAT MACLEOD  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (?)  MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment, a \\\"rehab assignment\\\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs. Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills.  #41 TOM PEDERSON  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (B+)  Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in 43 games.  However, his size (5' 9\\\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically, on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach. But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.  #45 CLAUDIO SCREMIN  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (D+/D)  He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.\",\"If I have one thing to say about \\\"No Fault\\\" it would be \\\"It isn't\\\"\",\"I am using DOS Quick C 2.5 in a DOS window under Windows 3.1, and the other day while I was running the compiler, I got a general protection fault immediately followed by a \\\"serious disk error\\\".  When I rebooted, I found that about 15 files had gotten \\\"cross-linked\\\" which is a pretty serious corruption of the hard drive file system.  I am concerned that Quick C in a DOS window has somehow strayed outside its protected mode world and corrupted the smartdrv.exe disk cache and that is what caused the disk problem.  I thought that DOS programs run in DOS windows were pretty well-contained  by Windows.  If that is true, then maybe the Quick C compiler has nothing  to do with it.  Has anybody else had this type of problem?  (I only recently \\\"upgraded\\\" from Quick C 2.0 to 2.5.)

I said before the Holocaust. I'm not ignorant of the Holocaust and know more about Nazi Germany than most people (maybe including you).   What I resent is ignorant statements that call people names when they disagree with your position. Opposing the atrocities commited by the Israeli governement hardly qualifies as anti-semitism. If you think name calling is a valid form of argument in intellectual circles, you need to get out more often.  I don't think the suffering of some Jews during WWII justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government. Any attempt to call Civil liberterians like myself anti-semetic is not appreciated.
