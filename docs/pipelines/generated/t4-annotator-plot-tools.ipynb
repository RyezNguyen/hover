Follow the parts that you think are suitable for modern life. Ignore the others. For heaven's (!) sake don't take it literally.      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   So you think it is easy to be a Muslim? Or be a Buddhist? The Buddha's commandments are 500 yrs older than Christ's and in my opinion tougher to follow. Moreover the Buddha says that we are  intrinsically good (as against Christ's \\\"we are all sinners\\\").  Only we allow ourselves to be distracted. By meditating we can awaken  ourselves (etc etc). Also there is no concept of God in Buddhism.  (In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist). But to \\\"awaken\\\" yourself is no easy task. Can you stay away from eating meat? Can you sit still and think of nothing (meditate) for sometime everyday? Buddhists do (or are supposed to). Can you pray five times a day?  Can you fast for a month every year (Ramzan). Are you willing to give 1/6 th of your income as tithe? Muslims do. In fact I think  Jesus was an ordinary man (just as Buddha and Mohamed) probably with a  philosopy ahead of the times (where he lived).  Considering the fact that Christianity is a young religion (compared to Hindiusm, Judaism, Zorasterism, Buddihsm) it is also very probable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas. (There was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and the middle east at the time of Christ). And perhaps some more.

I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my  childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes.   I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very  angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It  carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some  time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and  `Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To  become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would  consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared  to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a  better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable  riches of knowing Christ.  As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that  they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time  they had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They  didn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.   For example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.    When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her  death, she said to me, \\\"As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew.\\\"  What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a  Jew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with  matzoh balls.:-))   I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My  sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who  do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people  Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.  This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their  experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while  following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.    I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.   It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have  a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small  sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it  and do not want to ask for it back.  And while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.   I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the  Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is  that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again,  being rooted in the past.   This is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess  around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of  Easter).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.  I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all  believers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish  Christian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. \",\" XGA or XGA-2?

All is not lost, however, as you still might belong spiritually to the Church by your desire to belong to it.  As you said, only God can judge the condition of a man's soul.  About judgment, on the other hand, St. Paul  1 Cor 5:12) urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians.  Following the Apostle's teaching, I judge that you should reconsider    returning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  He is the God who lives.    Concerning what you were told about non-believers when you were a catholic, that is true.  As I have posted before, Vatican II (Lumen Gentium, II,    n. 16) teaches: \\\"Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Chruch, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and moved by grace, try in their actions to do His will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation.\\\"    Responding to your solicitation for opinions on the thinking processes of God, the best I can do is refer you to Scripture.

It's more likely that the Moon will never be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch,  and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat  sink capacity could offer some military utility for \\\"high ground\\\" military weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space  travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as  Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor  activity in the global scope of things.  Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to prevent calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it's too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink, and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.  We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few centuries, if not much longer.  Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument. The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for conventional warfare again.

You'll recognize this \\\"sticky button\\\" symptom immediately if you have such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle.  Liam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead  suggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly (_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described my defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told Apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of warranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering where my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the serial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed) range Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.  Nothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make it worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice. Please, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don't assume you know what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start hacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it. Please take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:                    United States      1-800-776-2333                   Canada             800-665-2775                   UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01                   Australia          61-2-452-8000                   Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500  If the number isn't toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask for a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register the details of your case, including your mouse's serial number.  Be firm.  Network managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user bases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don't send mail to me or post yet another \\\"sticky-button\\\" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.  Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch.  That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game, Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about  winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch.  Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible.  Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games.  I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.  But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan.    -- The Beastmaster   \",\"A few comments on the ATF's botched handling of this case:  1. Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation    we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult    members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit    of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,    you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule    is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is    incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.  2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were    outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When    questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault    was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were    thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew    you could!  3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,    hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and    referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm    more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not    related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up    some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's    now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by    the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I    was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI    agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say    uncomplimentary.  4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that    the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the    reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing    this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references    to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around    the \\\"He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\\\"    flag.  Sigh.  5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege    reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought    processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button    because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My    only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to    the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to    an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in    the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the    forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In    that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones    Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:    Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and    other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the    BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have    been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it    was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's    paranoid delusions.     --   #include <std_disclaimer.h>\",\" actually,  teh D means the registered driver has diplomatic immunity.

I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target, then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to harm.  But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away, heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this moment is hazy.  I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not. So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!  Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.  What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?  I eagerly await comment.

NEWSPOT, January 1993   MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.  Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.    Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine.    Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly magazine  \\\"ENA\\\"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek general election.    Bulev said in the interview: \\\"I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.\\\" Sideropoulos said  in the  article that \\\"Greece  should recognise Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the border, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC are falling.\\\"    The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court summons,  was   that  \\\"they  have   spread...intentionally  false information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the citizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the international interests of the country (Greece).\\\"    The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian.    In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000 in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.    Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian human rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live.    Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent, especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.    Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections are over.  Serdar Argic\",\" This is a ridiculous argument for being a Christian.

Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a \\\"fake\\\" Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data.  Quest 1.

The only question is how many shots he will get off before somebody is wise enough to take it away.   I don't see why people expect Boston to finish sixth.  The bottom four teams last year were essentially tied.  Boston, in seventh place, had 73 wins.  The Yankees and Indians, tied for fourth place, had 76 wins.  Now I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than the Indians or Tigers.  Basically, the Red Sox are stronger this year at 1B, DH, SS, LF, and RF.  They have healthier starting pitchers (so far, at least) and better relievers.  I see no reason why they shouldn't win ~85 games.  Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles and the Tigers *still* have no pitching.  They will win some 20-3 blowouts, but they will lose an awful lot of 7-5 games too.  *MAYBE* the Sox will play poorly, win 78 games, and finish fifth.

From all I've heard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg- ressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car at the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that he grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in Germany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic). What you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due to fear':  When driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody fails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can go (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :). So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex- posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to handle it - or you lose...  That's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation -  whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to the volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more people (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened) and each accident is one accident too much.   Better designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto- bahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word -  a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high); those guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals can crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is that esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very timid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.   You're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) - but the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that in Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding the local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm used to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I consider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...   Sorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a Peugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over here - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.   I disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars weigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at 130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph, it makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on a bicycle: Your're dead.

Although not many patients with Hep B go on to chronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is something to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which also leads to cirrhosis.    Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function.  Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas, among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic circulation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis.  These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in men, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplant.

The whole tenor of this release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only \\\"business\\\" use is legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's ear to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate. Note that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only reference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized release' bit is also drawing a long bow.

The ITARs seem to slightly impeed this.   Note that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret. Only the 'proper people' will be able to express an opinion, hence only the desired result will emerge.   Encryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in equilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT.

Q. How do I become an astronaut?      A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably     impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying     passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have     so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to     win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet     experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you     want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \\\"mission     specialist\\\".      If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,     the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly     exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,     but thinning the lineup down to manageable length. It is not enough     to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,     many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.      Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands     dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer     programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-     seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in     another seems to be a frequent winner.      Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight. (DO NOT get a     radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows     what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term     effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other     significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,     you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.      Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in     appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying     to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you     are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you     will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is     a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and     proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.     Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,     and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.     Keep your nose clean.      Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;     experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.      Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,     43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were     a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).     If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job     at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \\\"you     do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\\\".      Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance     to demonstrate motivation.      Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.

Space Shuttle Program Description     ---------------------------------      The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated     that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming     routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in     the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then     returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and     flight crew.      The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment     and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation     of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials     processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will     eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space     station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher     orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space     Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include     government agencies and private industries.      The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,     and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are     assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA     astronauts.      Pilot Astronaut      Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.     During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,     crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the     commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the     pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing     the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other     payload operations.      Mission Specialist Astronaut      Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,     have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations     in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and     experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to     have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed     knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and     objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the     experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission     specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling     using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific     experimental operations.

Citizenship Requirements      Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of     the United States.      Note on Academic Requirements      Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic     education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --     specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum     in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's     degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,     biological science, physical science, or mathematics.        The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the     sciences, are not considered qualifying:       - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,  Medical Technology, etc.)       - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological  Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).       - Degrees in Nursing.       - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)       - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.      Application Procedures     ----------------------      Civilian      The application package may be obtained by writing to:   NASA Johnson Space Center  Astronaut Selection Office  ATTN: AHX  Houston, TX 77058      Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA     decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be     given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is     made. Applications received after that date will be retained and     considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually     of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate     continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants     who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from     consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the     preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be     requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as     supervisors and references may be contacted.      Active Duty Military      Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their     respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application     procedures will be disseminated by each service.      Selection     ---------      Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required     for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.     Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered     will be notified of the outcome of the process.      Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the     selection of additional candidates during a one year period following     their establishment.      General Program Requirements      Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be     assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,     Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and     evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or     scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to     ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut     training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills     required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot     astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during     their candidate period.      Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does     not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut     will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and     evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the     training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become     permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for     a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not     selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA     depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that     time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a     specified tour of duty.      NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified     minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.     Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.      Pay and Benefits     ----------------      Civilians      Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal     Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,     and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements     and experience.      Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and     participation in group health and life insurance plans.      Military      Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center     but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and     other similar military matters. \",\"This appeared today in the \",\"Well, I'm amazed at how successful this exercise was. I received 20 responses and 4 requests for summary. Thanks to everyone who made it possible.  On my own I was able to find out about Codebase, Accsys, and Q+E. Codebase and Accsys are C libraries without SQL. Q+E is a Windows application that can be communicated through Windows DDE calls, where you send a SQL string and receive the results.  Most people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Borland. Other  products mentioned were: Microsoft's ODBC, Accsys, Quadbase, Codebase, RBASE, and Q+E. Only ODBC, Quadbase, RBASE, and Q+E have SQL.  For myself, I decided on Codebase, mostly because it has an ANSI C portability version that runs under DOS, UNIX, etc, and includes the source code, and portability is important in my application. It works with DBASE, FoxPro, or Clipper files.  However, I feel that Microsoft's ODBC looks very promising. It's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries, and formatting query results. As the responses say, it's available via ftp, except it's effectively unusuable without two manuals: the \\\"ODBC Programmer's Reference\\\" and the \\\"ODBC SDK Guide\\\". Moreover, ODBC doesn't actually interpret SQL and liase with databases, that's  up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers. Also, it's Windows only (it's actually an extension to the Windows SDK).  Nevertheless, it's a start at a SQL interface standard, and should make life interesting in the future.  Here's my original post, followed by the responses, separated by  a line of asterisks (*).   ****************************************************************************  Borland has a product called Paradox Engine that does just what you want.  The current version is 3.0, which is fully compatible with (ack) Paradox 4.0.  (Why the versions are different, I don't know. PD Engine 2.0 was compatible with Pdox 3.0 and 3.5...).  It consists of a rather broad library of functions for accesing database files from both Pascal (I think turbo Pascal 5.5 and up) and C (I think either Microsoft or Borland).  Now.. reading the box... it's \\\"Borland Paradox Engine & Database Frameworks\\\".  Works with any Borland C/C++, Mocrosoft C 6.01 or later, Turbo C++ for Windows, Turbo Pascal 6.0 or later, TP for Windows 1.0 or later.  For Framework applications, BC++ 3.0 or later or MS C/C++ 7.0.

With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a  large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand him and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something  like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that \\\"different is good\\\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in  more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a certain \\\"propriatory nature\\\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to  learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.   Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.    I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time.    Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off.   The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always  take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later).     Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).     All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and  shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.   Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.   I think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it's a small one B^)).   I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.    9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the street cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry the \\\"Highway Patrolman\\\".   Vincent, please don't take any of this as a flame.  Just my $0.02 (whoops, looks more like $2.00) worth.  And much of it is IMHO, but do check Ayoob's book.\",\"   Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power.  When graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft, presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft doesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes 'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope'.   Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans, such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed taxi tests).  I'm sure Mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know about this process (and then some).  --  \\\"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live  in the real world.\\\"   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden\",\" That's a typical claim, though they say they've improved compression speed considerably.

Yes (2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000  running at 15.87 Mhz. (3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a  lot of memory. (4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors  that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors  sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell  memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most  memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether  the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine  California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB -  $140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that  are selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here. (5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an  average access time of about 25 ms. (6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a  backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move  your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or  non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.  Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay  for it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to  sell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about  $650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for  about $900.   The answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.

This is second hand, so I don't know how true it is, but I have no reason to doubt it either.  Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge hockey team.  The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I can't remember his name) either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the Bradley Center.  Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but  turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too high.

You might also look at our product MetaCard.

The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example, was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign. His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound.  Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately.  I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed.

On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available.    The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5.

I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm on the Mac side. I have used Procomm, Kermit, and Softerm (on OS/2) on the PC (or PS) side. I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardware ahdshaking cables. And know MY hands are shaking from the effort. Nothing has allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS.  In general, I can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sides are set to speeds OVER 9600 baud. I cannot send files from the Mac to the PS at all, and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible. When I do a straight ascii send, I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly. I can send Binhex files this way quite fast, and I know that the transmission is error free. But straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors. Unless, of course, I do text pacing so slow that it is like human typing. (well, like 2-3 times faster than human typing).  I would like to hear from ANYONE who has been able to transfer files from a Duo 210 to a PS via modem or null modem. If you can do it, please tell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software. Obviously, I am talking of a true serial port modem, not the express modem. Maybe some kind soul with access to a modem and a Duo 210 can check this out for me.  Right now, I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds because of the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speeds because of some crazy reason I don't understand.  Could I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information out the serial port of a Duo 210 fast? Like via a modem or via a sys-ex dump?  Could anyone with a Duo help me out?? I am going absolutely INSANE. I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos, or just me.  Yes, I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times. And not only can I type back and forth, but Zterm alerts the users if s/he uses hardware handshaking and CTS is down. So I know that hardware handshaking is working. And also, According to Zterm port stats, the buffer never overflows.

This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in a powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was told by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return the original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for returning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.  Well, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were ever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me \\\"Why we never received your old chips.\\\"  I then explained I the procedure that I had followed to return them, to which the person replied \\\"You mean you sent them US Mail?\\\" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that I should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly what I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were absolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted to trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to TechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.) Sales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them to \\\"make it right.\\\"  I finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking them to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously appeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with the service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way of knowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengths to prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c'est la vie.

Generally, these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, for example, we have the following set regarding children:   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to   the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum   [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem   families and received as servants when they are left alone through   the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect   all such children in your province and send them to the places of   deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to   the people.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [1]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the   time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their   lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.      Minister of the Interior,       Talaat\\\" [2]   \\\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.    November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the   orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their   places of exile.        Abdullahad Nuri. [3]    \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been   opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is   done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt   of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or   any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it   purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as   detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received   into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish   special orphanages for them.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat.\\\" [4]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.     Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures   to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with   the caravans.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [5]   \\\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.    At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows   of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is   not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by   Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble   in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned   out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of   deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent   away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [6]  In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \\\"rationalizing\\\" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:   \\\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for   its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks   it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I   shall die for it.\\\" [7]   These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these \\\"death march orders\\\" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.  For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.  If one were to examine the sample \\\"authentic text\\\" provided in the Turkish  Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it  too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the  Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or  Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery.   Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide  architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a  heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.  This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian.     - - - references - - -  [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60  [2] ibid, page 60  [3] ibid, page 60  [4] ibid, page 61  [5] ibid, page 61  [6] ibid, page 62  [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and     London), 1926, page 387  \",\" Pardon me?   *I* am trying to apply human terms to non-humans?

Jim,  I think you must have come in late. The discussion (on my part at least) began with Benedikt's questioning of the historical acuuracy of the NT. I was making the point that, if the same standards are used to validate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history, then virtually nothing is known of the first century.  You seem to be saying that the Bible -cannot- be true because it speaks of the existence of God as it it were a fact. Your objection has nothing to do with history, it is merely another statement of atheism.\",\"  Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by sentence.   1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.  Origins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?  2) Science cannot explain origins.  This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends on what origins we are talking about.  3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science.  Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \\\"higher truth\\\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \\\"higher\\\" or  \\\"lower\\\"; they are simply true.  More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the scope of discussion.  4) This is a false premise.  If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.  5) By the way, I enjoy science.  On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read. However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy, perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.  6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.  Let us not quibble; count this one as true.  7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]  Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification:  \\\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\\\"  -----  It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.\",\"   I had this one time.

While I'll agree that these are generally held to be \\\"good things\\\", I question whether they come very close to being objective values. Especially considering that at one time or another each has been viewed as being undesirable.  I doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally \\\"good\\\" or \\\"bad\\\".  And when I referred to \\\"the truth\\\" I was using the term hypothetically, realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing.   True enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than personal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some \\\"higher authority\\\" (aka, absolute moral truth).   An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth? Interesting notion.   :-)  Certainly one can have as one's morals a belief that compromise is good.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?   Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating production.  The equation is always more complex than presented. To characterize relative morals as merely following one's own conscience / desires is to unduly simplify it. \",\"After I have produced a schematic with PADS-LOGIC, how do I import it into  PADS-PCB to create a PCB pattern?

And Windows 3.1 is also flexible enough at install time that you can copy all the files onto your hard disk, which greatly speeds things up and makes them less annoying, if you can spare the 7 or so compressed megs.   No, we're not.  But we're also not going to promote pandering to corporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience.  I don't *like* dealing with floppies.  Personally, I have no use for changing the registration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to be solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour reinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one way or another.  So, while I'm not going to put much time into it myself, here's the procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:  1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want to install it.  I've been using c:\\\\WINSTALL myself.  2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\\\\WINORIG.  3.  Install from c:\\\\winstall.  4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.       i.e., comp *.* \\\\winorig\\\\*.* >\\\\report.txt  5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming they didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one file should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate said offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hex editor, and do the same for the modified one.  6.  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don't really do cryptography.  It's probably just an xor key or something; I think MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing his copy than with \\\"real pirates\\\" who will probably just disassemble the damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original floppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able to back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a compare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).  As I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and don't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one directory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff I've mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if they'd ever find out.  If you aren't careful with the disk editor, you could also mung something important... duh.  I guess that's a disclaimer.  Have at it....

While I can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area. I rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is more likely to become such a tool, and that it IS such a tool in many instances.   I suspect that this is because \\\"improvement in the human condition\\\" as you define it is not the primary goal of libertarianism, and would not be the primary goal of a libertarian government.

Good and evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.  The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's rebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of the Scriptures.  Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words of St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, this is called \\\"theosis,\\\" or \\\"deification.\\\"  One can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul, and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the Creator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God, their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in their lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.  The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil, its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.  Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining of self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?  God must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There is no other way to achieve union with God.  Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities. He was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites, and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God, not in His essence, but in His energies.  The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25.\",\" What about the common joystick found in all computer shops?\",\":Yea, there are millions of cases where yoy *say* that firearms :'deter' criminals.

The  satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section  housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof  mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The  proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation  pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered  around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.       TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The  2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a  single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be  powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).

Therefore there would be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of detecting whether some one had a radio in their car.  \",\" ------------ Part 4 of 14 ------------ M)G(F&G*Z<G*R)G(:NB8:NAHFNAJZ<AHF<AJZ)AH:&K*R&B9R)G(F&KHF&AJZ M<AJR&B9R)AHF<G)R&AJR&AJRNK)R&AIR&KIRNG(:NB:Z&G(FNAJZ)KJZ<KHF MNB;\\\"NAHFLEU=771T772Z772R)L)]NGT(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@( M\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@( M\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@( M\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\",M_?W_4?]0@U-34U-34U`)+;FX^IHY<,RLK*Y6$`)5V M(4,,#`Q#0T-#.R$,(3L[?71_;F[I1)MA*YPG%_51')SA5E9<8X.;LYJ:OK-D M\\\\2(B'<>&O[\\\\UQS4UD<<U+&EI:8:_Q\\\\<(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@( M\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"+H:NG)RLF$1$9`1Y7\\\";2Y!Y M1)NSFDL$1#ZL'6C!TQ\\\"QL2(^FJRLK)IR&JT:<JVM<G)R&JT:<G(:&G(:<G(: M<AIR&B8F<B:R&B9R&G*R&K(F&AJZNKHF7;JZ7;*ZLK)TNAZZ'KIT+'0L+\\\"PL M+\\\"PUQRPLQS4L+#4L-<>_-<?'QX:&QY$(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`AN2VO4\\\"=3JP2&( MW`*`P3M\\\\,%R7G.&!5E;KH9_,S!?U45$-V-C*V-C8.LHZ.LK*RLK8+SJ1RLHZ MRLJ1+SHZ.FG*.FF&.I%I.I%I.FG'QVDZ.L?'.B_':8;'QY''OVEIQY''QVG' M-;^&AK^&\\\"`@(,P%V'.L-=C/EH8',]1RK#1?,E\\\"CD)S=65G\\\";LYI#:+8(\\\"`@K M*P`K$9!N`JR:,'Q<5E9N;@(%.XC(@-.UIWX.C4,=L;8NM:>QB*XB(CXB.S`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`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@( M\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@( M\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@( M\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@F\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"$M_?VX\\\"2P)_U\\\"#4U-34U-0\\\" M`FX^IIM<,RLK*S,!`#-V0T,,#`P,#`Q#.SM#0SL[.WU+;F[I1)MA8>0G8%'U M'.O>-U968X.;,#\\\":2+.:K*PB(L=I:36&QS4U-6F1-6EIQP@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@( M\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(NKJR)L*Z MLAK\\\"NBLS$1$1Y7\\\";2Y`_1)NS9$L$1#Z('6C!TQ\\\"QL2([FJR:9+-RK16MMQ^M M%7*M%:VW<G*M%7(5%145MQ6M%:URMQ]R<JT5%7*MMW)R<K<:<JT:<G)RMW(F M<B9RLG(:)G*ZNK*Z)EW\\\"PK)=NEVZPKH>NBQT=%U]?2PL-2P(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@( M\\\"`@(\\\"`A&2VO4\\\"=3JP>`0N<B`P3L^LUR7G.$*5E;KH8%6E!<745'U.I'*.LJ1 MRCHZ+Y'*RI&1RI%!.H8Z+VG*.D%!.I$Z+SII.CJ1QY''D3HZ.L?'QY&1O\\\\?'

Stace \",\"I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly, (motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only \\\"real solution\\\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the \\\"internal nerves\\\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that \\\"force\\\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\",\"I have been looking for a book that specifically addresses the mystery of God in the paradox.

In practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed  with inkjet because smudges etc. can happen.   A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of  that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than  you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the  printer.

Paper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter  will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that  are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.  HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the  software package has no inkjet driver.   There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a  page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a  laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers  actually use this facility.

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.   The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password   and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full   descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli   [BER91].    decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.    There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,   Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will   decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox   files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you   think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a   call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files   that have a 10 char or less pw key.''  * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?    A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the   plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.   If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the   following:     1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.   (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of   the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.    If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something   over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different   key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes   of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which   indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.    2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This   removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since   English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of   text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing   plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact   one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)    If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a   standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis   texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in   the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.   See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].  * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]    Here's one popular method, using the des command:      cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail    Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called   PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through   1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.   There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this   writing.    There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting   mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own   newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ   as well.    PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm   without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)   in the USA.    RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which   is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside   the USA.    Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of   the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the   message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there   have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and   algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as   we know).  * Is the UNIX crypt command secure?    No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt   breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks   on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].  * How do I use compression with encryption?    A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by   some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).    Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact   distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's   impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse   characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up   more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy   has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some   redundancy in your compressed output.    Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they   have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that   actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of   UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''   that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.      This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a   bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means   removes the need for strong encryption.    Compression after encryption is silly.  * Is there an unbreakable cipher?    Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the   one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as   plaintext.    Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be   useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by   likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is   expected to remain valid.  * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?    Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom   number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be   cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to   predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of   the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of   0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.    A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function   of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently   random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by   the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps   generated by a hardware random number source).    Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,   generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of   entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,   cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo    gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in   it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,   for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random   string.    When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is   important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that   because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \\\"random\\\".  For   example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be   unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a   clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.  * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?    See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount   of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in   the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number   of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this   can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to   back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.    Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have   multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security   from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.    Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic   measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives   probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext   for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible   plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys   are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally   deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine   the likelihood of events of interest.    Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than   D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not   enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of   possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,   which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to   8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but   the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work   required to find the key after approximately D characters have been   intercepted.    In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used   in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key   size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if   it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few   practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all   manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack   some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic   considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a   recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.   Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and   information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most   promising directions.    Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information   statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal   1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the   possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].  * What is key management and why is it important?    One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in   full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,   and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of   course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling   Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)   Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can   eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in   modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are   transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but   also enough key material to cover the traffic.    Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and   handling of keys.    A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology   is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use   employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key   Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that   certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control   personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and   to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the   reporting of lost CIKs.    This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management   problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,   many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''  * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?    Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from   relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a   linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random   number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds   and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a   high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically   this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for   cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more   complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---   but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable   structure at all.    See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].  * What is the correct frequency list for English letters?    There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than   the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:   namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of   English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,   but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.    The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do   you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a   fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It   has changed over time; it is different between different authors.   Any particular message will have different statistics from those of   the language as a whole.    The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have   exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all   reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.   In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other   buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood   estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a   text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with   reasonably robust answers.    So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will   be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.  * What is the Enigma?    ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of   information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by   the British during WWII.''    See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].  * How do I shuffle cards?    Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of   values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output   permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you   need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly   distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that   function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH   is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two   addresses given)    for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;    modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since   ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the   error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s   modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less   than y, go back and get another ranno() value.   * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?    Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with   possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted   separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps   even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.    As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard   PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the   keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be   encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in   part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one   of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.    If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must   be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in   the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.   The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the   illegal copy.   * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?

Most atheists are perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesus--but are quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into  misunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications.  They can always make an analogy with the _Iliad_, a book that tells the story of the historical Trojan War, but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations.   I don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of  Christianity through argument.  We have to help foster faith and an understanding of God.  I could be wrong--are there any former atheists here who were led to Christianity by argument?\",\"  The problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about the Bible which they don't actually believe or practice. I've known all sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to the fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the  conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is a (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyone who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition. While I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official position of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).  The particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in terms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact  that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane  and give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this  (other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would  show them that what they claim about the Bible and what they  actually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.  While this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians, I would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this case, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually put into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and look at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying to express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the Christian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as \\\"Word of God\\\", \\\"inerrant\\\", \\\"infallibale\\\", \\\"The Manufacturer's Handbook\\\", \\\"The only rule of faith and practice in the church today\\\" to describe the Bible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at the mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably false and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even when the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical example is from the garden of Eden where God asks \\\"Where are you?\\\" and Adam explains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had answered God's words he would have said something like \\\"I'm here in this tree.\\\" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these words are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of the place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases and explanations that others use.  I hope this helps. --                                                                      ___ Bill Rea                                                            (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---\",\"We have a user that has Word 5.0 and is using symbols such as pi and other mathematic sysmbols, plus doing fractions, etc.  The document shows up on the screen with no problems, looks fine.

For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth, you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer. A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be the payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within the capability of the amateur rocketry community.  It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reduction of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'. Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed here: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year on the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of an orbital eyesore/CCD burner.

I do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards.  He does not have too much offensive capabilities, but he is an awesome defensively. Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:) I forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.   As far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who beat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.   I agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that Lankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make a perfect throw?   I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don't forget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/ Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant race when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I will never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading in the right direction.   One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds, but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the East), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they lose.  Maybe this is the year that they will go all the way.

The whole organization (read: EJ and Ley, and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much of a dupe to know how much he was being blind-sided by EJ) dumped on Francis all season, starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract, publicly  humiliating him, stripping him of the \\\"C\\\", and then trading him that Spring to the Penguins. Classy guy, that EJ.  The loss of Francis (and too a lesser extent, Ulf), was one of a series of decimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fan-awareness from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today.  [Gratuitous good EJ note...he did preside over the organization when it acquired Verbeek, Cassels, Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, etc. He stripped the roster but he DID lay a foundation.]\",\"  And yet, Jayne,  as we read the Gospels and in particular the topics that Jesus himself spoke on, Hell figures in a large % of the time -certainly more than heaven itself.  Paul, as we learn in I Thess, taught new believers and new churches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation.  Rev, chapter 20:11-15 is very specific and cannot be allegorized.  I think the word \\\"throne\\\" is used 45 times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the assignment of the severity of judgement, for in John 3 we read that they are already judged.  Rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut.  There is no recourse, excuse or defense.  Yes I agree with you.  Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to extremes before stopping at \\\"moderation.\\\"  I think we have seen the extreme of the \\\"hell fire & brimstone\\\" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme where hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones sensibilities.  I forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a story.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the point of telling him that he didn't believe in Satan or hell.  He believed everybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to pray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man wouldn't do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don't believe in hell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn't exist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn't exist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And yet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.  I'd use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it.  When I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul that isn't called, oi vey!.  What's with that ref that he didn't make that call.  It's unfair.  And just so in life, righteousness demands payment.  As the surgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that which is still of the old creation.  We must preach the Gospel in all its richness which includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life, then broad is the way to distruction.   I think I would fall in there somewhere.  Actually it was both.  After all, repentance isn't only a turning towards, but also a turning away from! No, again, if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we should do it also.  In love, of course, but in truth most assuredly.    I have thought about writing something on this topic, but not now and here.  I would say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its eternality.  1) God is Light.  Yes He is love, but His love has the boundary of Holiness. 2) Dignity of Man.  Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature.    If responsible, then he is also accountable. 3) The awfulness of sin.  Today we have a poor, poor concept of sin & God. 4) Christ.  He was willing to die and go there Himself to offer an avenue to    the \\\"whosoever will.\\\"\",\"The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory, a 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season.  Roster move:  Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill  Injuries:  Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes  Dominic Roussel  Game Summary:  I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts I didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by a few things I did pick up:  First Period:  Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51  Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp) Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda, Har (interference) 18:43  Second Period:  Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00  Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09  Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38 Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski, Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50  Third Period:  Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)  Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11  Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38 Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30  Overtime:  Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15. Penalties - None  Power Play:  Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4  Goalies:  Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)  Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)  On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off.  The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.  The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie.  On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner, Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play.  That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored, much less how.  From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy  Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark. But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????  What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...  #1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey next season.  #2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour, and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.  #3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season. Not a tough choice.  Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.  Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman in years to come.  Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some things you just can't argue with.

They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as many goals as they allowed, 319.  The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.

What compromise are you talking about on Cyprus. That is not Greece business to join the island to Greece. That is up to people in the island to live or not to live together. They made their decision and they are living  separetely now.There is a peace there. Greeks can't slaughter Turks anymore because turkish peacemaking force is there. Your dream will never come true. 12 mile territorialwater!!!! Are you joking or dreaming? We can declare our 12 miles territorial water which can come close to Athens. How would you like it? If you have any guts why don't you shoot at some Turkish ships in your dream 12 mile territorial waters? We do not have any city called Konstantinople. We have a city called ISTANBUL!!!! All the greeks in Istanbul are being treated just any other Turks. There is no difference among people in Turkey. You look at your own backyard first before talking about human rights in Turkey. What are the rights of Turks in Greece? Nothing. They do not even have basic human rights like right to have property, fredom of religion, fredom of press, fredom of vote elect their community leaders. Government of Greece publicly encourages people to destroy and burn schools, religious places, houses, and farms belong to turkish minority. Then, Greek government forces these minorities to go to Turkey without anything with them. You will dream to see Aegean sea as Greek lake but it will never happen. Think about the war between Turkey and Greece in 1915.

You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and **as a such you must pay the price.   You mean that any person who supports the actions and policies of the government of Greece is a good person. That is your Greek idea to say Turks are bad people. We know who we are and proud to be TURKS anywhere in the world. That is not Greeks business to tell us what kind of people we are. You are not at position to judge people because you are not civilized enough to give equal rights to your own minorities. Millions of minorities are being treated as third class citizen, their rights are taken away from them, and they have no voices under the Government of Greece. They are almost being treated as slaves even though we are getting into 21th century.

Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to education, to establish a family and have children, to human dignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are more important to human existence that the rights of states.  2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.  3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an unresolved conflict exists.  4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples and nations.  5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.  6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional political means have failed.  7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the land, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.  8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice. When people love, they share.  Having stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.  1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew and the other Palestinian-Arab.  2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner, although born in areas under current Isreali control, is not entitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.  3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For the second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each subsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.   4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and Christian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of governments and international organizations.  5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on 'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the Middle-East in a graceful manner.  Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will attempt to identify some of these:  1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However, it is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation.  2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the 'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but Israeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be defeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights (see above)  3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their point of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People overrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of human rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar Bronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing assimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its effects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see above)  4.      It may objected that only a few people in Israel/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes.  5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has merits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than $3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government and by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the Middle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a non-segregated society in that worn-torn land.  I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment.\",\" Purists often distinguish between \\\"true\\\" clubbing and \\\"pseudo\\\" clubbing, the difference being that with \\\"true\\\" clubbing the angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly negative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip). With \\\"pseudo\\\" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then negative, which is the normal situation. \\\"Real\\\" internists can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple of minutes.  Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only \\\"true\\\" clubbing is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is very reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the  congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization.   The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally.   Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however, the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.\",\"  They are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust' is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during  the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited,  assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people  because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts  of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes,  set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts  behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly  attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population  indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent  Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with  axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt alive as can be seen below.  Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions  of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and  Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion, also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from  behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of  Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed  widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena was left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from  Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide  by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian,  Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French  journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.  The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum,  Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their  villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred. The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for humanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German, Austrian, French and American authorities.  Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and  cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by  Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish  and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents.  Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of  the victims of these cruelties can be heard.

All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from  Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly  slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to  save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful  events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then  taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people   well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these  places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.  They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the  Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality  problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers  who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and  Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the   Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.   I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is   destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are   speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as   well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is   proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.\\\"                                                       Dr. Stephan Eshnanie  Serdar Argic\",\"  As usually, you are not reading.

Before that, I used to get bloody noses, nighttime asthma attacks, and eyes so itchy I couldn't get to sleep.  After about 6 months on the shots, most of those symptoms were gone, and they haven't come back.  I stopped getting the shots (due more to laziness than planning) in college. My allergies got a little worse after that, but are still nowhere near as bad as they used to be.  So yes, the shots do work. \",\" I'm not aware that the US government considers me dangerous.  In any case, that has nothing to do with the current case.  The claim against the ADL is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that was gathered by state and/or federal agencies in the course of their standard interaction with citizens such as myself.  By that I refer to things such as: address and phone number, vehicle registration and license information, photographs, etc.   You should ask the ADL, if you want an authoritative answer.  My guess is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in political criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as agents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them. At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to Israeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matters will be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.  As my previous posting shows, California law entitles people to compensation even in the absence of any specific consequences -- just for the further dissemination of certain types of private information about them.\",\"[deletion] : >Perhaps these encryption-only types would defend the digitized porn if it : >was posted encrypted? : > : >These issues are not as seperable as you maintain. : >  : Now why would anyone \\\"post\\\" anything encrypted?

I'm not sure how practical that is with the Mississippi.  You'd better check with health agencies along the way to see if there are toxic chemicals in the river.

In their names we demand justice.  In April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed  de-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a  genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The  result: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen and plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization on those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish governmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In  the face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies  shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy  merely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state  policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a  crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the  successful genocide of the Armenians.  Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet... Armenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of  Turkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as  \\\"rebels\\\".  Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population figures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.  Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims  Armenians were a \\\"threat\\\".  In a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of  approximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.  Today, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The success of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish population.  The Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and property lost as a result of this genocide.

See the discussion of \\\"high-power rocketry\\\" in the rec.models.rockets frequently-asked-questions list.  This is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy; you need proper certification.  That can be had, mostly through Tripoli (the high- power analog of the NAR), although the NAR is cautiously moving to extend the upper boundaries of what it considers proper too.  You need special FAA authorization, but provided you aren't doing it under one of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that, it's not especially hard to arrange.  As with model rocketry, this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled properly.  Proper handling takes more care, and you need a lot more empty air to fly in, but it's basically just model rocketry scaled up.  As with model rocketry, the high-power people use factory-built engines, which eliminates the major safety hazard of do-it-yourself rocketry.\",\"subscribe comp.graphics quit \",\"Hello, I am looking for commercial software packages for professional fashion designers.

Basically the Glock is great but I have heard/read that it is a lot harder to learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has.  I was looking at a Glock .40S&W and the S&W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the safties on the guns were very different.  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot more \\\"safe\\\"  (for lack of a better word) than the one on the Glock.  Of course this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  You would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.  Personally I like the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool (guess that's why they use them in so many movies) but I wouldn't get one as my first semi-auto because of the safety.  I would prefer more training with a \\\"traditional\\\" semi-auto (ala Colt .45) but of course that's just my opinion.\",\"  Let's face it, if the words don't get into your noggin in the first place,  there's no hope.

JCAG and SDPA claim responsibility.   Source: Edward K. Boghosian, \\\"Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity Meeting,\\\" The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.  ATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties, including the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both Armenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the  Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.  The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of the Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of ASALA...  Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian people, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal... Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement  was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam  Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued  support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause,  pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be  open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr.  Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that  his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that this policy will continue. \\\"The doors of our camps are always open to  Armenian freedom fighters,\\\" he affirmed.  Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet; two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of the Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations, a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.  More than significant was the large number of messages received by the  organizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary Movement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.                   SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM  Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will continue to \\\"reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,\\\" to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag \\\"Bureau.\\\" The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement, open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.  The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the Greek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence. The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

That is rediculous. The U.S. media is the most pro-israeli media in the world. Having lived in Europe I realize that incidences such as the one described in the letter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to ignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the Europeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think that might be a reason they report more clearly on the atrocities.  What is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of the inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing received from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt go away.

It's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting, since I always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity.  I understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race, religion, ethnic background, sex, or other inconsequential characteristics.  All the evidence I've seen indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics.  Thus, pending further evidence, I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people are bigots, and organizations that exclude such people are discriminatory.\",\"nan\",\"Yes, there is:  consumer confusion.  In the early 80's with the fuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage than comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their 350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big mistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine could not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with these cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer -- DON\\\"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.  Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving, LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper in the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them? Trailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines? No, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a 500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.  I own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine. Just keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline engine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that  when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350 engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about $2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long and gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine costs about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection pump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again, you never need a tune-up.

There's more to a real \\\"storage\\\" scope than just a long-persistence phosphor.  Actually, the phosphor ISN'T usually anything special at all; what makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just *behind* the phosphor, which becomes charged as the electron beam intially \\\"writes\\\" the trace. With the trace now written to the screen, a separate low-level \\\"flood\\\" electron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphor which are next to the \\\"written\\\" areas on the storage screen.  There are some problems with this - the resolution is limited compared to a non-storage tube, and the stored trace tends to \\\"bloom\\\" with time.   Of course, this is pretty much obsolete technology, done in by the current digital scopes which use raster-scan displays and keep everything in a frame-buffer memory anyways.            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Ah, yes - from the same people who brought you that amazing new reading program that's sweeping Eastern Europe: \\\"Hooked on Consonants!\\\" :-) \",\"Archive-name: space/intro Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:10 $      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO      INTRODUCTION      This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet groups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth preserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).      If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to your KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).      The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.      Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization.      Questions fall into three basic types:      1) Where do I find some information about space?      Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask     for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There     are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended     discussion.      2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?      Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been     thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for     evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.      3) Miscellanous queries.      These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of     FAQ postings.       SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE      Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.     Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]     Edit \\\"Subject:\\\" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.     Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth  100 posts).     Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST  not SPACE.     Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all  references.)     Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're  responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!     Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail  or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the  'reply' function of mailers will work.     Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone  will get on TV anyway.     Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:  keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals  (use carriage returns).

The war in 1982 was instigated by the Arabs who continually murdered Israeli children with their rocket attacks.  Israel was only trying to stop this.   Last what the heck are you talking about with \\\"1968 (Karama)\\\"?  There was  no war in 1968!       Steve -- \",\"The SDIO has \\\"contracted\\\" with the NRL (Naval Research Laboratory) to fly the Clementine Mission.  BTW we call it DSPSE (Deep Space Project Science Experiment).  The NRL is building the spacecraft, designing the detailed mission and doing the integration and operations (with help from, JPL & Goddard & prob. some folks I have left out...don't be mad).  I am on the TAMP (Trajectory Analysis & Mission Planning) team and am responsable for the IV&V of the traj that Goddard/CSC are designing.  As for why SDIO is doing it, some of the reasons are:     1)  the safety constraints are too tight to try to run the LIDAR in LEO     2)  in LEO we don't get any new radiation data on the sensors, we will get        that data on our 9 passages through the Van Allen (sp?) Belts     3)  since we are going out there...why not piggy-back some general science     4)  the intercept problem is a lot easied over LONG distances and LONG times  I am sure there are some things I have forgotten, and some I haven't been told but, those are the reasons we all talk about.  --  \",\"  Windows Sources Magazine reviewed a number of 17\\\" monitors recently and they too said that the Nanao T560i was the best monitor to get if you had the money. But they also said that the Mitsubishi Diamond Pro 17 is the next best choice and that it has superb picture quality. This monitor can be had for around $1070.  Has anyone actually seen any of these? I am also thinking of buying a 17\\\" monitor and was going to consider the Mitsubishi. If I remember correctly, I think its viewing area is 16\\\" measured diagonally.  Thanks. \",\" First off, let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about \\\"You sick perverts, you are immoral, you are all going to hell.\\\", which seems to be the usual \\\"religious\\\" post found on the alt.sex.* hierarchy.  Hopefully, you won't get flamed, either.  You will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is built on unsteady ground.  First, I do not believe that there is any way to find an \\\"objective morality\\\".  Morality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a person or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even overwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.   Second, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say, you are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by using the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so.    Third, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will always be people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we all are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the religion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring, overbearing totalitarianists?    Hm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to discuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I start off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with you.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of your own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views on homosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the purposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to have their faces uncovered.  The sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind.                                                                              (Evidence deleted)  I'm not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept \\\"The Word of God\\\" that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument for a person who shares your beliefs.  Still, I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could be interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part.   Hmmm...do I detect just a wee bit of condescence here?                                                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     not very objective.    One could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better, or \\\"more good\\\" than non-beautiful people.  I would hope that people relize that this is not necessarily true.                                           ^^^^       Might I suggest the word \\\"penis\\\"? It seems more in line with the tone of your post.              Bravo!  I respect you and your sense of humor, sir.                                                     Yes, and this theme is usually what the better stories are about.  However, they are not always selfish - I could point to examples in the work of Elf Sternberg, for example.   It serves the same purpose as it does in pornographic movies: it affirms the virility of the male involved, as well as assuring the reader that he (the character) has orgasmed.                         Your Whole Picture [TM] unfortunately only applies to people who accept your church.           In addition, if sex is for procreation, then  1) Why did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it, rather than building it in as instinct? 2) Why did God make it fallible?  Not every sexual encounter results in pregnancy, even among Catholics.  Does this mean that they have sinned?     Granted.   Pornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for it.  Many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real life, but will think about and read about and mull over.

I went for a retailer, actually mail order (CDA computers), because its price was better thant the campus computer store. I found out why later on when I tried to get a repair done at an Apple registered repair center - the CPU was a resale. The serial number had been removed and replaced with a non-standard number (probably from CDA computers). Consequently, the Apple repair man could not do ANY warrenty repairs. So I ended up with just a 90day warrenty from CDA over the Apple 12month warrenty. Boy, was I pi**ed! Moral of the story, CAVEAT EMPTOR.  However, if you go with a reliable, trustworthy mail order firm (if they exist - maybe someone could enlighten us with their experiences), you will probably get a better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail order out of state does not REQUIRE sales tax yet. Though for how much longer remains to be seen. The addition in sales tax on a CPU purchase will probably wipe out an educational discount. Again CAVEAT EMPTOR, some mail order companies DO include sales tax on purchases even if they are out of state, so check!\",\"To: Dodge Dart collectors  I have a 1964 Dodge (25th anniversary) Dart 273ci V8 wagon to turn into cash.

First somebody was accusing him of being self-righteous and unconvincing. Now we are told that we Christians should be embarrassed by him. (As well as by Josh McDowell, about whom I have no comment, having never read his work.)  Anyone who thinks that C. S. Lewis was self-righteous ought to read his introduction to The Problem of Pain, which is his theodicy. In it, he explains that he wanted to publish the book anonymously. Why? Although he believed in the argument he was presenting, he did not want to seem to presume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own suffering. He did not want people to think that he was presenting himself as some kind of model of fortitude, or that he was anything other than what he considered himself to be -- \\\"a great coward.\\\"   OFM has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be embarrassed by Lewis' liar/lunatic/lord argument (which, by the way, is part of a *much* bigger discourse.)

Presumably only recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention. The necessity it refers to has always been there, but it's been implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of the new window.   [...]  This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a border-pixel, and the problem should go away.  There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.

The outcome was decidedly mixed.  I won the battle but  lost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was  defective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below  market value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average  retail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but  the decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the  Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the  fact that if you have an automobile that does not  depreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive  to deal with you.  There is no way that the  manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and  sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded  a repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's  representative at the hearing tends to support this  point of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not  seem to take the proceeding very seriously.  I decided to take the repurchase, even though I am  getting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have  to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon  myself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on  the Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to  my elected representatives telling them how utterly  ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for  a \\\"use deduction\\\" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.   As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying  for my insurance.  Summary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton HD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992  this vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems  that required attention included the transmission,  heater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main  problem was the five speed manual transmission.  They  could not install a non-defective transmission in at  least four attempts.  So, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but  you are going to get screwed on the price, unless you  paid too much in the first place, or if your car  happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.\",\"  > I wonder if Ojeda will sue anyone - because his career may be over.

What else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial number?    To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is    first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.    S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a    64-bit block R1:      R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .     Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and    N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]      R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .     R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The    first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The    rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2    are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow    agencies. \",\"  I don't know a whole lot on Proton, but given that it is a multi stage rocket,  up to 4 stages, it may not really need the Centaur,  plus it may end up seriously beating on said centaur.

The moderator replies:  That is generally accuate, but contains one serious error.  We Catholics do believe that God's revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in the Bible can be and is passed on through the Tradition of the Church. It should be noted that the Tradition of the Church, otherwise known as Sacred Tradition, is not the same as ordinary human traditions. However, we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to the Church.  Public revelation, which is the basis of Catholic doctrine, ended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  Nothing new can be added.  Theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications that were not recognized previously, so that the Council of Nicea could define statements about the theology of the Trinity and the Incarnation that were not explicitly stated in the Bible and had been disputed before the council, but there was no new revelation at Nicea or at any subsequent council.  Cardinal Newman's _An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine_, written while he was still an Anglican, is an excellent discussion of of this point.

Today I was turning a 90 degree corner just like on any other day, but there was a slight difference-  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very tangible \\\"thunk\\\".  I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage.  My bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the lower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a \\\"bank-follower\\\", or a little stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a 100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7 mm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the mystery.  The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'm fairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.    Okay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?  How can you rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without damaging the thread in the hole ?  Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo that Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly changes phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid ?

Is this correct?? If so, why the big time delay?? I know all scripture is inspired of God, so the time of writing is I suppose un-important, but I still can't help be curious!  --------------------------------------------------- Ivan Thomas Barr   Contact me at u9126619@athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk  [The Gospels aren't dated, so we can only guess.  Luke's prolog is about the only thing we have from the author describing his process. The prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to do some investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally that say a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There are debates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly don't have the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of them seriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, and was written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die. One tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words may have been made earlier than the current Gospels.    In the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbal transmission of information.  I think many people would have preferred to hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe even from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather than from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a period when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do think there was some written material earlier, which was probably used as sources for the existing Gospels.  Establishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to confess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods used.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64 AD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the Century.  A few people vary this by a decade or so one way or the other.\",\"    Well, pardon me for trying to continue the discussion rather than just tugging my forelock in dismay at having not considered actually trying to recover the energy from this process (which is at least trying to go the 'right' way on the energy curve).  Now, where *did* I put those sackcloth and ashes?  [I was not and am not 'pretending' anything; I am *so* pleased you are not surprised, though.]   Note that I didn't say it was perpetual motion, or even that it sounded like perpetual motion; the phrase was \\\"sounds almost like perpetual motion\\\", which I, at least, consider a somewhat different propposition than the one you elect to criticize.  Perhaps I should beg your pardon for being *too* precise in my use of language?   I will believe that this process comes even close to approaching technological and economic feasibility (given the mixed nature of the trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of separating things first and having a different 'run' for each actinide) when I see them dump a few tons in one end and pull (relatively) clean material out the other.  Once the costs, technological risks, etc., are taken into account I still class this one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun.  Sure, it's possible and the physics are well understood, but is it really a reasonable approach?

It sounds like you're suggesting  Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella.      Which reports are those?      I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter. Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem.       I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners. Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.     As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak  defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have.

JPEG (pronounced \\\"jay-peg\\\") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of \\\"natural\\\", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is \\\"lossy\\\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of \\\"realistic\\\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File    Size in bytes  Comments  ship.ppm 1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits     or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z  963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress     compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.     Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif  240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif     Most of the savings is the result of losing color     info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95  155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)     This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,     at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75   58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)     You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this     from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50   38406  cjpeg -Q 50     This has slight defects; if you know what to look     for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing     the original.  Still as good image quality as many     recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25   25192  cjpeg -Q 25     JPEG's characteristic \\\"blockiness\\\" becomes apparent     at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).     Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were     of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o    6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)     Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or     indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:     the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good \\\"quality\\\" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  \\\"Quality 95\\\" does NOT mean \\\"keep 95% of the information\\\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \\\"op art\\\".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just \\\"high\\\"/\\\"medium\\\"/\\\"low\\\"-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \\\"How to find sources\\\". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with \\\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\\\" in the body.  The \\\"Anonymous FTP List FAQ\\\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for \\\"canned\\\" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the version number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on export or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits internally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to convert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first. But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG. CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check the \\\"save at normal size\\\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) \\\"msdos/graphics\\\" at Simtel20, that really means \\\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\\\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) \\\"/pub/msdos/graphics\\\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip     Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip     PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \\\"AugJPEG\\\", \\\"NewAmyJPEG\\\", \\\"VJPEG\\\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris, but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The \\\"official\\\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article \\\"How to find sources\\\", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \\\"JFIF\\\" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called \\\"color quantization\\\".  (This is something of a misnomer, \\\"color selection\\\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \\\"smeared\\\" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as \\\"256-color JPEG\\\".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit \\\"hi-color\\\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying \\\"-Q 100\\\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say \\\"-sample 1x1\\\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to \\\"do their own thing\\\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \\\"low-end\\\" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a \\\"high-end\\\" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \\\"lowest common denominator\\\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     \\\"raw JPEG\\\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is   \\\"begin\\\" line  M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with   \\\"begin\\\" line  M:'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different \\\"back end\\\" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The \\\"fair use\\\" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (\\\"ghost\\\" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \\\"dithered\\\" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to \\\"smooth\\\" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try \\\"-smooth 10\\\" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that \\\"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\\\" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net. \",\"seningen@maserati.ross.com (Mike Seningen)    The funny thing about the digital dash (87 T-bird) with the 85mph speedo  limit was that if you pressed the button to convert to kilometers it would  read all the way up to 187kph.

It seems to me the time and money involved in travelling out there (unless this person is close to you) wouldn't be worth it for a small claim. It really depends on how much money you're out.

When I eat foods with MSG I get very thirsty and my hands swell and get a terrible itchy rash. I first experienced this problem when I worked close to Chinatown and ate Chinese food almost everyday for lunch.  Now I can't tolerate MSG at all.  I can notice immediately when I have eaten any.  I try to avoid MSG completely.  Interesting fact though is that all three of my children started experiencing the exact same rash on their hands.  I couldn't understand why because I don't MSG in cooking and we ask for no MSG when we do eat Chinese (I still love it).  After some investigation I knew that Oodles of Noodles where one of their favorite foods.  One of the main ingredients in the flavor packets is MSG.  Now I look at all labels.  You would be surprised at places you find MSG. \",\": The driver had looked over at me casually a couple of times; I : know he knew I was there.  oh, okay.  then in that case it was attemped vehicular

If you don't have the GRASP package, I'm afraid I can't help you.  Sorry.

ESPN had prior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had contracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal was very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this one-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the season started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by squeezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota game) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball telecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last night).  But the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.  They must honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have something to do with it, especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach of contract with baseball.  So relax.  I'm happy.

The reason the neutral and ground are tied together in the panel is the tranformer on the power pole has a grounded center-tap secondary, with the grounded center-tap the neutral.  This gives 120v to neutral(ground) from each side of the transformer and 240v across the transformer.  So in effect the neutral and ground should be at the same potential.   ------------------------------------------------------------------ Mark E.

Yes, I think he should have done more to get out of the way.  As much as fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning the game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware that this is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch it himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.  I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against  visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the field.  Now, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or not.  Sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize his first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win. \",\" If no-one looks at the results, or acknowledges their correctness, in what meaningful sense can the chip be said to \\\"work\\\"??

Phil    ------- Forwarded Message  Subject: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption  Note:  This file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.      ---------------------------------------------------                           THE WHITE HOUSE                    Office of the Press Secretary  _________________________________________________________________  For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993                   STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY   The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?\",\"Word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centred character to indicate spaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw.  Our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character  displayed is a large hollow box.  They overlap each other and characters on each side, which is useless.  I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183). This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corel font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183 character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W. Altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font graphics displayed however!!  Is the W4W character used to indicate spaces the period-centred character?

The simple fact is that there is not a Christian on the face of the planet (that I know of!) that is perfect.  I have been known at times to have a fit of temper, or a sulk, but this does not make me any the less a Christian.  One of the points of being a Christian (as I perceive it) is to become MORE LIKE Christ.  This statement inherently suggests that we ARE NOT already like Christ.  Jesus never unrighteously lost his temper.  I do.  Jesus was perfect.  I'm not.   You must understand that this is because Christians often forget to treat others as our role-model - Christ - would.  This is because we are human and falible.  I, for one, do not pretend to be infalible, and I hope that my fellow-men will bear with me when I make mistakes.  This surely is not too much to ask, when I make every effort to bear with _them_.    And don't we know it!   Again I say, we are ALL human!  To my brethren, this:    Ms Duticci has a valid point and we as Christians ought to heed the warning in her article.  We oftimes discredit ourselves and our Saviour, in the way that we treat others.  Strive towards the goal set us by our Lord, but in the meantime, remember :       \\\"There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ...\\\"  When you blow it - go easy on yourself.  Forgive yourself, as your Father in heaven forgives you!  And remember - and this is something I firmly beieve and cling to - one day, we shall see Him face to face, and in that day, we shall (finally!) be perfected.

I've got a problem that  I need as many people's help from as possible.  Before I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell you that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy meets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...  OK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family and I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the street, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me... her name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have been writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about 2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago.   By the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.  OK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming back to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I drove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent the whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though we had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being in person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met. (She's one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could ask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to  mention WAY out of my league...although I'm  not unattractive mind you), but she had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the extent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she knows I am a Christian.   Well, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such a thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid you not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.  In out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding dates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her). She has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended up leaving school....Now we are at the present...  Let me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....   \\\"Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm not going to KU anymore because something just isn't right.

This isn't the first time a group has committed suicide to avoid persecution/capture... and you seem to miss the point that the raid SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! I find the FBI actions too damn reminiscent of the Warsaw Ghetto... fitting  that Al Gore was in Poland for events marking the 50th anniversery of that... Remove any references to dates and you have two raids by government troops wearing black uniforms, carrying automatic weapons, backed by armored vehicles, against religious minorities they claim were practicing sexually deviant  behavior and hoarding weapons... Too damn similar...  James  ps: I am not advocating the BD's, I just find the whole situation too damn  troubling. \",\"According to the official documentation, failure to use the IIfx terminator can not only affect SCSI bus performance but can also damage the bus. Whether this is your problem or not I don't know. I have had sporadic SCSI problems with my IIfx since I bought it. (I cannot connect more than three devices, fourth one causes major problems).  First thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system. If you continue to get errors it is probably the drive. If it formats fine then I would try to format it on your system with no externals. If this  fails then the SCSI controller on your IIfx needs repair/replacement.  Hope this helps.  \",\"I want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around 5 megabytes / sec for very large data transfers.  (Around 5 MB.)  I have a Quadra 950.  I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.          (using block-mode transfers) I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can          achieve 6.8 MB/s.  Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.  It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer, then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)  So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer,   Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer. Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer. Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.         ... Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer. Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.  Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously, and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho') each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.  Why?  Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time.) Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use the same bus to mac RAM?  Is there anything I can do?\",\"  ------------ Part 14 of 14 ------------ M<1D9&;\\\"P4U/M[>V+BXN+-#0T-#0TQ33%Q6=G9V=G#P\\\\/#P\\\\/9V?%Q<7%Q30T M-#0T-#0TBXOM[>WM4U.PL+\\\"P&1D9&1D9&1D9&1D9&1D9&1D9&1D9<7%Q<7$9 M&7%Q<7%Q<=+2TCT]/9F9F0,#7EY>N[N[*BHJ>GIZW]_?W]_?W]]'1T='I:6E MI4='I:6E\\\"PL+\\\"V9FQ,0Q,8>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AS$Q,<3$ MQ&9F9F9F\\\"PL+\\\"PL+I:6EI:6EI4='1T='1T='W]_?>GIZ*BJ[N[N[NUY>`P.9 MF3W2<1D9&;\\\"P4U/M[8N+-#0T-#0T-#0T-#0T-#0T-,7%Q<7%9V=G9V=G9P\\\\/ M#TQ,3$Q,3(F)B8F)B8F)B8F)B8F)B8F)B8F)B4Q,3$Q,3$Q,3`\\\\/9\\\\7%Q<4T M-(N+[;`9<=(]F0->NRIZWT='I0MF9L3$,8>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AS$QQ&9F\\\"PL+I:5'1T??WWK?

A capacitor kludged in somehow, etc?  I've got a microcontroller that is running a bunch of valves and pumps in a big instrument washer, and almost everything is being switched with zero-crossing solid state relays, so that stuff stays \\\"quiet\\\", AC-wise. But there's one steam valve that gets turned on by a mechanical relay in the water tank fill/thermostat system, and it's not under control of my SSRs, and it does sometimes generate/radiate a spike that resets one of my peripheral chips.  My software times out and tries again, but I'd love to just tack in a magic spike-killing fix that would avoid having to do some major rewiring/redesign.

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier. The Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.

But, are you using Paul to correct the words of Jesus?   \\\"So *anyone* who dissolves even one of the smallest commands and teaches others the same way, will be known as the lowest in the kingdom of the skies; whereas *anyone* who keeps the commands and teaches them too, will be known as *someone* great in the kingdom of the skies.\\\" Mat5:19 (Gaus)  Are you an \\\"anyone\\\" or are you a \\\"no one?\\\"  Why not assume, that since Jesus didn't say that his words apply only to Jews, that they apply to all human beings, irregardless of race or sex?  Why not assume, that even though Jesus did not mention your name, still Jesus was talking directly to you?   Does it say that it applies to *you*? Are you anyone or no one?   Ex20:8-11(JPS) Remember the sabbath day and keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; you shall not do any work - you, your son or daughter, your male or female slave, or your cattle, or the stranger who is within your settlements. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth and sea, and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and hollowed it.  Note: There is no specific requirement for worship here, however I for one would not be so bold as to call these verses a \\\"ceremonial detail.\\\"   Don't many Christians still practice circumcision?   It's unfortunate that Jesus didn't use your name directly, or maybe Jesus did? Are you somebody or nobody?   If you don't see a problem, then perhaps there is none. As Paul closes Romans 14 (Gaus):    In short, pursue the ends of peace and of building each other up. Don't let dietary considerations undo the work of God. Everything may be clean, but it's evil for the person who eats it in an offensive spirit. Better not to eat the meat or drink the wine or whatever else your brother is offended by. As for the faith that you have, keep that between yourself and God. The person is in luck who doesn't condemn himself for what he samples. On the other hand, the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty, because he isn't acting on his faith, and any failure to act on faith is a sin.\",\"I have a question regarding sending a NULL character across ethernet connection.

Thanks\",\" No.  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost, and Ron Hextall is the reason Quebec won.  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that goaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're Montreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it; he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides, Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.  Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more).  Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than  five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME  ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear  the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to  play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.  Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this article, if possible.   I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who) in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in regardless.   Yep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second, IMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.  Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their zone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red  Army.    But I still hate the team.  On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a powerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit.  Same goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is waving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  New Jersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario is unbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.  But I  hate that team anyway.  \",\"  And not only that, made a second clone from the same tissue sample after that of said domineering wife, to run at the helm of the more-pro-business party under guise of more free trade ... and she did inhale, many times, to boot ...

Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it (as long as my advisor doesn't catch me - which is easy enough to do), but  stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review  committees and the peer review process in general.  In today's world that's  what determines what science is: what gets funded.  And a damn good thing to. Flights of fantasy just don't have much chance of producing anything, at  least not in biomedical research.  The surest way for a graduate student to ruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with  fleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a project that actually has a good chance of producing some results.  MD's seem to  be particularly prone to this aberrant behavior.     I have to agree with Gary Merrill's response to this.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2) swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.  2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked to the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity from April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay Antenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to 11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.  3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment data; long term trend analysis is continuing.  6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation index is near the optimal level.  7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument. Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed during the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.  9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.

Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21 (Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller (TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The 10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was not metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.

Thanks a lot in advance!  --\",\"I'm a biker and a dog-lover.  First and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first.  Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent.  Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible. But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!  Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a game, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one; when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of.  With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures may be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important -- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The larger the dog, the greater your anger.  Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.  Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped punishment.\",\"I was wondering if anyone had any kind of Fenway Park gif.

It is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the \\\"normal\\\" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in absence of this, laterality can be \\\"random.\\\" People with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong side).

Without delving into a deep discussion of : >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code : >>perfect and without flaw.  : >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~  Do you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and has degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement, shouldn't we?  Perhaps the biggest \\\"imperfection\\\" of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains.  Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes.   On the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted later, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused, if introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated, since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are conserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and these are not found in or near intron sequences.   I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting \\\"theological arguments\\\" like this.  Try Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish & Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.  : Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does : God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a : theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely : scientific perspective, just different.  Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas  theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.   : I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect, : but that doesn't mean it's perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.  For the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support your assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective, unless you support it by some evidence.  In fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we've thought - for instance, sex might have evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by computer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.)    : Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma : rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.  In fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action.   : Actually, neither of us \\\"knows\\\" what the atmosphere was like at the : time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most : biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after : all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth : was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I : seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for : the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?  I'd replace \\\"created\\\" with \\\"formed\\\", since there is no need to  invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one. Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8 billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years. This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve.  I'm sorry I can't give any references, this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry I attended here.   : >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer : >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of : >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the : >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.    Again, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for this supposed \\\"degeneration\\\"?

I hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests  everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against this conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in  anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the  right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so, and not to present one's own conclusions prior to this.   Theology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions.  : >>Human DNA, being more \\\"complex\\\", tends to accumulate errors adversely : >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the  : >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  : >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence : >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial : >>diseases/disorders.  You are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators from degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to  survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it  to the present.   And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection, and thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either claim.   : But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in : answering John's question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases, : and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require : babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God's fault? (the original : question) -- I say no, it is not.  Of course, nothing \\\"evil\\\" is god's fault.  But your explanation does not work, it fails miserably.   : You may be right.  But the fact is that you don't know that : Satan is not responsible, and neither do I. :  : Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it : be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills : that affect mankind?  I don't think so.  He could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is, it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution.  : Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference. : Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the : point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I : never said that people are \\\"meant\\\" (presumably by God) \\\"to be : punished by getting diseases\\\".  Why I did say is that free moral : choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject : God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not : expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic : universe.  I am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone. I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.  What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?    : Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).  But I'm working on it.  :)  A good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.  : What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the : question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are : fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain : *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don't explain : the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.  Why is there a \\\"why behind\\\"? And your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend these books.  Is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence for this? If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al) suggest, why do people still insist on this?   : Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am : not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details : of biology and genetics, although I'm sure I'd find it a : fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do : not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the : beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its : environment.  I'm sorry, but they do.

My observations over the past 30 years (and not withstanding a little history reading beside) is that while religious differences do play a part in many of the conflicts, so does (unfortunately) race, economics and any other items that identify one group of men as being different from another.  If we want to couch the cause of conflict in Christian terms, I would put it while Christ died for our sins, we are yet sinners. While some individuals assume \\\"Christlike\\\" natures, most of us do not even come close.

Manuals still shrinkwrapped, and all  registration materials present.  Asking $125.  \",\" A number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens, and tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For citizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves on a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places, is for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place in banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc... Quite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card for such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public. Furthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information.  The only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might be taken into account is during interaction with the police, based upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are clearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field is being used to discriminate against them officially.    I take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries do know that they have nothing to fear from \\\"Israeli expansionism\\\". Militarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of land under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a sustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing the Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the Awali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal strip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire. Public opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada via territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from battle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it.  With regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree with the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating a starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal and a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders, the negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state smaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller borders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic and sensible.   Your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a \\\"center for policy research\\\".  Whether or not all of Vanunu's revelations were true has no bearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing \\\"state secrets\\\" after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that said secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished. As to which were and which weren't, I am under no moral obligation to disclose that - quite the reverse in fact. He was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue with a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the concept of \\\"Secrets of state\\\", something which every democratic govt has.   I noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist more than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted, which you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such reports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill, as tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not made public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know about it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours. This would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.   Well, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such questions are often termed \\\"tabloid journalism\\\" and are not disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity. Such questions were often used during the McCarthy era as a basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use your own example, these questions might have been lifted from the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray as a larger and dirtier picture.  My answers were not any more \\\"hysterical\\\" than the questions themselves.  The problem is not that the q's were provocative, it was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You fall into the same category of those who seek \\\"yes\\\" \\\"no\\\" answers when the real answer is \\\"of sorts\\\".

Whatthey do not tell you is that if you get mace directly   on the linings of the lungs (such as a direct snort to   the face) above certain quantities, it reacts similarly   to a mustard gas inhalation.     I know:  my father and grandfather were exposed    to poison gas in WWI and WWII; Dad went through    the side effects of any WEAPON, including those    \\\"non-toxic\\\" aerosols.    WHat the label ACTUALLY means is ::     usually, it wont kill you    it may give you permanent CSS asthsma    but that's better than blowing a hole in your     head ...    ALL aerosols are flammable IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OXYGEN   AND HIT IT WITH THE RIGHT IGNITER.  SOme of the most   non-flammable substances known will BOOM or SEARFLAME   if you hit it with the right combo.     Let's take one:  a trash can fire.  Makes black smoke;   already burned right?  Can't go boom, right?  Wrong.    Suck that smoke (made up of paper that has carbonized,   or burned about 35% of the fuel in it) into an air   conditioning return, mix with about 5:1 air, and light   a match.  200 feet of conduit is about the same, when   filled with that smoke mixture, as oh, say 200 pounds TNT     THAT is why the fire codes say NO OPEN CEILING    TILES IN BUILDINGS.  Because 3-5 stories of    a building have blown OUT by \\\"nonflammable _smoke_\\\"   So:   Take a little \\\"nonflammable aerosol\\\"   Mix with gasoline or kerosene fumes     NO electricity, remeber?  A bit of heating    on the WACO plains?  Boil water to drink    since the water was cut off?    liberally mix and allow to settle for 1-4 hours    Fumes vent down into the bus underground, and the Davidians   move the children UPSTAIRS to a saferoom (they had one,   armor plated, remember?) to BREATH, because kids get sick   and die from tear gas.    and along comes a tracer, a spark, what have you:     everyone burns to death.  Try thinking before opening mouth: it may not have happened the way the Gmen say it did.\",\"Hi,  I am new to this newsgroup, and also fairly new to christianity. I was raised as a Unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an agnostic, but recently I have developed the firm conviction that the Christian message is correct and I have accepted Jesus into my life. I am happy, but I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and quite possibly about what Christians should hold as true. This I am trying to rectify (by reading the Bible of course), but it would be helpful to also read a good interpretation/commentary on the Bible or other relevant aspects of the Christian faith. One of my questions I would like to ask is - Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological works intended for a lay person?  I have another question I would like to ask.

The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I   can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same   application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application   that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I   need to re-boot.  Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I   first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many   GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows   (with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge   machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into   the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into   the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I   was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother   board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from   SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized   fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.  The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes   rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves   the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't.   I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said   these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire   day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's   in the sppace of 20 minutes?  What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good   diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software   problem (ie EMM386 etc.)?

Can anyone provide any info? Thanks in advance, --Peter\",\" Dear Defiant (or Unfaithful or Pixie):  I will take up the challenge to reply, as I am a theist.  The foundation for faith in God is reason, without which the existence of God could not be proven.  That His existence can be proven by reason is indisputable (cf. my short treatise, \\\"Traditional Proofs for the  Existence of God,\\\" and Summa Theologica).  Now, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason, I assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?  Because God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter, the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the Measure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order to the universe (logos).  I next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is contrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And, since God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior as early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that because a human (Adam) was first responsible for man's alienation from the Source of all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship. Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.  Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim is true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.  You next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United States Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned, and thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For example, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, he could have denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true.   Therefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.  QED   --  boundary\",\"I bought my HP48sx calculator a month ago, used once but put it back in the box.

Wouldn't it just make more sense to find some way to cut down on the cost of malpractice insurance?  And maybe that's not such a good thing. I also read somewhere that it is next to impossible in Canada to litigate against the health system-class action suits are nearly impossible, and you can't sue the provincial health officials at all.   Oh no. Don't let the AMA know about this. They have enough power as it is. Ask most Americans whether they'd like the doctors' lobby to get more powerful.   Well, yeah, tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre outside Ottawa. Theoretically it's limited to service personnel, but some studies I've heard about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not only have connections but aren't \\\"urgent\\\" at all.  The problem is, in a system where hospitals' annual budgets are approved by the government, how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions? I bet that if you're an MP or MPP, or good friends with one, you're put on any hospital's \\\"urgent\\\" care list no matter how minor your problem. Which is OK  unless you're someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot.   Hmm. How much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of GNP spent on health care if dentistry and optometry were included in the accounting?  Maybe Canada spends proportionately just as much on health care as we do.   So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse. Bob Rae, the second least popular man in Ontario, warned Ontarians a few years ago that if they didn't stop cross-border shopping in such huge numbers, \\\"the services they expect from the province just won't be there in a few years\\\" (Fortunately for them (and less fortunately for the retailers here in Western New York) the  Canadian dollar went back to a more realistic value). He didn't say so, but I knew he meant the OHIP. What would happen if his warning turned out to be the  truth? Would the private insurers take up the slack? They'd be under no  obligation to. Of course, they could eventually make money again, but if what you say is true, they'd be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling  such basic services, too).   Would that it were free. Americans would start another revolution if they had to pay taxes at Canadian rates. \",\"   That brings up an interesting point. Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked  at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they were 24, and noticed some interesting things.     For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also   found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc.     It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory.

I also recall that Cecil Andrus, who was Secretary of the Interior during the Carter Administration, responded to Watt's comments by pointing out the stewardship role that God gave to man, as recorded in Genesis.  Which makes me wonder: who are the true conservatives?  It seems to me that a *conservative* should want to *conserve* things of value for long-term societal benefit.  This form of *conservation* should logically extend to the physical environment in  which people live, as well as the moral environment in which they relate to one another and to God.  IMHO, Watt's stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served  on the board of directors for Jim Bakker's organization, during a time in  which Bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed Bakker  in federal prison.\",\"     Not necessarily.  I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme is to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange, either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme like Diffie-Hellman.  If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone company or some other online central authority generates a session key and sends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of having some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for a copy of the session key for each call.      Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of every public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably, there will be some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally- signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit, stored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to everyone's public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to the security of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you don't use your designated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips.      It might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you to use either the original public/private key pair, or some other key pair and verification scheme.

(Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.) Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:  1) They don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is  still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the  load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground  return), so you still get ground and power line bounce.   2) They do help a lot with on-chip loads, as I had with the high load  on the clock lines.   3) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high  frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff  capacitors, since the RC time constant is too large.  What I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich,  but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent  diff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly  lines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probably  omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,  using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high  resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).  4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with  slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for  output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.  I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for  a MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I  needed.

One approach is simply to try and move political opinion and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Another approach is to try and amend the constitution.  The original constitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention for 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it. The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains government (particularly state and local), even though on many particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I think libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via an amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).  Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this as a problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That might be true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  If a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then falls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This is unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now, but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of, if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.\",\"------------------------------ Wrong, if a bunch of faggots from the tenderloin decide to go straight bashing and they selectively target a heterosexual man and beat the bloody fuck out of him, they would get charged as well under all the federal laws that exist about violation of civils rights. The focus of their intent is his sexual orientation, and so the law applies to them as well. The national government retains the right to make any laws necessary to sufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone's civil rights until that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it! The fact is, that at last count, gays were not beating straights for their sexual orientation. Thus, the law is getting applied only to the straights who indulge themselves. The federal government or judiciary has the right to enforce the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under law even if it takes 1000 possible charges against people who would violate them. Go read your constitutional law. We broke the back of the KKK's harrassment campaign with the same strategy in the early 1900's. So many went to jail and for so long that it cut the heart out of the KKK.  -RSW  ---------------------------------------- This \\\"mutation\\\" as you call it, protects your little butt too, if you happen to be somewhere where you're the wrong \\\"shade\\\" for somebody else's taste.

The first use of such laws was well over a hundred years ago, and constitutional scholars of all conviction recognize that this right reserved to the federal government is well established and not just some short-lived peculiarity, too!

What strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of Lucifer's fall - which, by the way, I seem to recall to be more speculation than based on biblical text, but my ex RCism may be showing - is that, as Benedikt pointed out, Lucifer had perfect nature, yet he had the free will to \\\"choose\\\" evil.  But where did that choice come from?  We know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a tempter which many assume was Satan, but how did Lucifer discover, invent, create, call the action what you will, something that God had not given origin to?  Also, where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer's free will? We make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes me as being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, like salvation, not one that all Christians believe in identically.  At least in my mind, salvation and free will are very tightly coupled, but then my theology was Roman Catholic...  Still, how do theologian explain Lucifer's fall?  If Lucifer had perfect nature (did man?) how could he fall?  How could he execute an act that (a) contradicted his nature and (b) in effect cause evil to exist for the first time?\",\"xIn article <1qgi8eINNhs5@skeena.ucs.ubc.ca> yiklam@unixg.ubc.ca (Yik Chong Lam) x>Hello, x> x>       Does anyone know how to take out the bolt under the engine x>compartment?

The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is a one-way hash function? * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.? * What are MD4 and MD5? * What is Snefru?   * What is a one-way hash function?    A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and   produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally   impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't   determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not   even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also   computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the   same hash.    A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an   encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash   function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are   relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user   is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,   and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the   signature can do the same thing.    Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.  * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?    There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a   very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which   isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it   a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption   functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have   hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1   if and only if X = H(M).    A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private   decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the   previous question, have public hashing and public verification.   Digital signature functions have private hashing and public   verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,   but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.    Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to   be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real   difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key   isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend   rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing   ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.  * What are MD4 and MD5?    MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.   Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is   available from [FTPMD].    Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft   RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a, though some   people refer to it as MD5.  * What is Snefru?\",\" I knew that Cutie would sell us out.

(818) 354-5011  Contact:  Mary A. Hardin  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993 #1506       Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to measure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.       The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airport reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took measurements as part of a program established to correlate data with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).         The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle Discovery.       \\\"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important ways,\\\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on the balloon research campaign.         \\\"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\\\" he continued.  \\\"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists, and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own right.\\\"       The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring.  Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps scientists construct more accurate computer models which are instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.       The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere; a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the atmosphere absorbs sunlight.        Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three- hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130 kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m. Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded to separate from the balloon.       \\\"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurements,\\\" Margitan explained, \\\"and we also needed to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\\\"       It will be several weeks before scientists will have the completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS scientists.           The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon Facility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a contract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.       The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.       The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements Program.                        \",\"[The following is my comment on an article by Desiree Bradley.  --clh]   Koresh did originally claim to be the Christ, but then backed off and said he was a prophet.

The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the Holocaust is a myth, archivists say.  \\\"The notes give them their authenticity,\\\" said Robert Wolfe, a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  \\\"He was supposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his own rules.\\\"  The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.  Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than 100 German secret police generals.  \\\"I also want to talk to you, quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly. I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish race.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been written and is never to be written.\\\"  [Emphasis mine--rje]  The German word Himmler uses that is translated as \\\"extermination\\\" is *Ausrottung*.  Wolfe said a more precise translation would be \\\"extirpation\\\" or \\\"tearing up by the roots.\\\"  In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism, \\\"Judenevakuierung\\\" or \\\"evacuation of the Jews.\\\"  But archives officials said \\\"extermination\\\" is the word he actually spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.  Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's \\\"final solution of the Jewish question,\\\" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.  The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum here on April 26.  The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of Himmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.   ---From p.A10 of Saturday's L.A.

Thanks for the help \",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis   Dear Josh  I appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions.  Having said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.  1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards identify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S. citizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are just trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or religious identity to any public official who so requests ?  2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all kinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy. You did not respond to my question.  3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is interesting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear weapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?  4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a Ma'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases like Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and imprisoned.  5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status of the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for the occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law). The law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so, why doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?  6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return conflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands of non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under Israel control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from returning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also left, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to return. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ? Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in his homeland ?  7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that information, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all inhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other atrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by Israeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University Press. Is this book available in your library ?  8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in Israeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very little evidence available about that. As much as I know, many Arabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are not accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want Arabs ?  9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was whether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to discourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but evaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants to keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious communities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests to officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a secular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.   I would be glad to have some more input from you after these comments.\",\" This is a very good point.  One that I have held for sometime.  We do not allow people to develop on the paths that they choose or desire.  Even with heterosexuals we tend to leave some hanging in the sense of knowledge and information about sexuality and relationships.  It is very difficult for a young person to develop and build a positive view of themself when they are constantly being told implicitly and explicitly that they are wrong and immoral. \",\"Personally, I follow the no alcohol rule when I'm on a bike.  My view is that you have to be in such a high degree of control that any alcohol could be potentially hazardous to my bike!  If I get hurt it's my own fault, but I don't want to wreck my Katana.  I developed this philosophy from an impromptu *experiment*.  I had one beer at 6:00 in the evening and had volleyball practice at 7:00.  I wasn't even close to leagle intoxication, but I couldn't perform even the most basic things until 8:30!  This made     me think about how I viewed alcohol and intoxication.  You may seem fine, but your reactions may be affected such that you'll be unable to recover from hitting a rock or even just a gust of wind.  I greatly enjoy social drinking but, for me, it just doesn't mix with riding.\",\"I've been trying to get my Fujitsu M2611T 45mb hard disk (circa  1990) to share my IDE card with a new Seagate ST3283A 245mb one.

Strange but true.  --The Bobmeister\",\" From the limited details released so far, It seems that the clipper chip  system must employ some sort of public key cryptography. Otherwise, the key  management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system  unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place at the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in  their data base?  This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key  algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is  rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that  could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.     As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to ban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they  need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont  have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, they talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed. They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without  court order even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on  their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright? I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all (legal) ways possible.\",\"The Toshiba has a 200ms access time, the NEC has a 280ms access time, right around the Sony/Apple.

The primary U.S. objection is ``Iran's international behaviour'' which includes ``extending support of violence'' to disrupt the Arab Israeli peace process and its rapid build-up of dangerous weapons.  Mack said ``Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace but first it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area.''  Mack spoke at the U.S.-GCC business conference aimed at promoting Gulf-American trade. He said the ``Middle East will be an item very high on the agenda of the U.S. administration.''  The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State Warren Christoper's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhere else in the world, Mack said. He added that the U.S. has no long-term plan to station troops in the Gulf.  Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue to pressure Iraq to ``comply with all the U.N. Security resolutions.''  ``As long as Iraq is ruled by Saddam Hussein we do not expect compliance,'' Mack told delegates. \",\"While playing around with my Gateway 2000 local-bus machine last night, it became apparent that Windows 3.1 didn't give the option for 32-bit access for virtual memory.

I guess I don't think it's out of line to talk about a generalized repentence for our contribution to or participation in \\\"The sins of society\\\" , or for our tacit approval (by our silence) of sinful attitudes or practices....it may be that we're also just plain begging for mercy, hoping God will withhold his hand of judgement on our whole country for the sake of a few, much as Abraham sought to do for the sake of Lot.

Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:  John Sorenson Carol Sigelman Carla Moore Barbara Moose Judith Schrier  Again, thank you to all who gave!  I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to  review the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.   It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett  Packard Scanners.    When initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options;  (1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3)  automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image.   I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which  parts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.  Once an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The  software gives you two \\\"errors\\\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were  converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.   Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted  correctly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more  credit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue,  you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal  dictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited,  considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary.   After a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word  processor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a  seperate TIFF or PCX file format.  I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.

While most of my faxes were received in \\\"standard\\\" mode (200x100 dpi), the  accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent.   Overall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the  limitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just  too small.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has  been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g.,  Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus,  Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences  of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera,  malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore,  control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug  resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease,  salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging  infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those  in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and  minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of  emerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more  effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs  (3).       This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \\\"Emerging Infectious  Diseases.\\\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as  surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and  public health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation  of an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4).   References  1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

During January 16-17, a  case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or  postdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls  implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset  (matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January  18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants  was initiated.       As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January- February 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the  state health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case  definition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS  (Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with  confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of  symptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A  restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients  who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating  a regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17  through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30  developed HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years  (range: 0-74 years). Idaho       Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health,  Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture- confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December  11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were  hospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13  (93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California       In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was  notified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died.  Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with  E. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993.  Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was  reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27%  increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January  1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as  postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured,  or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with  onset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993.       Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The  outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen  persons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median  age of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of  the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community  controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched  OR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients  who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular- sized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3).  Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada       On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten  at a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District  issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea  contact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody  diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness  with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with  onset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local  laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools  for E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After  SMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of  one patient 38 days after illness onset.       Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine  were hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range:  0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex- matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during  the week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence  limit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients  also implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7- 49.8). Other Investigation Findings       During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases  primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November  19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \\\"jumbo\\\" patties produced on  November 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11  lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed  to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672  (20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall.       A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the  United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing  the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter  plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one  slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.       Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in  families and child day care settings is ongoing.

Editorial Note: E. coli O157:H7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first  identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody  diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). This pathogen has since  emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common  cause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked  most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other  food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been  implicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter  study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7  that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10  participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a  higher rate than for any other pathogen.       Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most  clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  SMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses  associated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea  (often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups  and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and  complications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients  develop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,  renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%.       This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community  outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite  the magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in  three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington  (1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from  persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5).  When infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported  to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public  health action to prevent further cases.       E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can  contaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S.  Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify  critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce  the likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply.  Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with  pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens  from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be  internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook  ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices  are clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played  an important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim  recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to  155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993).       Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report  and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be  consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of  outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of  this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections  caused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E.  coli O157:H7.

Long-term use of  smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of  oral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who  currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1).  To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products,  CDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease  Prevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing  tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian,  noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This  report summarizes findings from this survey.       The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \\\"Have you used snuff at least 20  times in your entire life?\\\" and \\\"Do you use snuff now?\\\" Similar questions were  asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of  smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco  use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the  time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having  used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the  time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and  former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at  least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as  those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not  smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on  smokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or  equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide  national estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using  standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN)  (3).       In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users  of smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%)  women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco  use was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was  highest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was  highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan  Natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American  Indians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was  substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in  rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only  for women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1).       Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those  aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of  chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although  women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest  among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.       An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being  former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were  former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons  aged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users  (56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95%  CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users  was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5%  95% CI=68.9-78.1).       Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0)  currently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95%  CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95%  CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco.       Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3%  95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6- 49.6).   Reported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease  Prevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National  Center for Health Statistics, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless  tobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in  particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that  link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral  snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this  behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for  nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4).       Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among  racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels  and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require  further explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role  in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the  differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6).       In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current  smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the  prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco  users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous  study among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  occasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked  reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to  stop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health  implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use.       The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special  population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless  tobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year  2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more  than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the  prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless  tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts,  enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes  commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to  routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based  prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit  tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).

I was wondering how you filled your crankcase though as I welded my hood shut also out of fear that somebody might steal my air-filter.\",\"  Dr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally  be believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing  Goebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks  who are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's  informed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For  instance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they  watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can  read the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what  really happened.   There are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee  Alumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society,  the Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation,  the Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek  Men's Lycee Foundation.    As for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish'  in titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts  have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association,  the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti  Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks in Western Thrace. Such community associations had been  active until 1984. But they were first told to remove the word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down. This is also the  final verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.  In the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish parentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment with no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was of Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three  years. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than  a vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority  complex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye.   The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,'  which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference  to 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the  existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the  essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger  Turkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the  three nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of  themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized  according to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'  It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece  and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world. The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish minority. They pursue the same denial in connection with  the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition, in 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091, virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting religious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek  governments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective of the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in Greece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders. Talk about democracy.  The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic  convention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an  attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a  violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called'  Greek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection  of historical monuments.   The government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new  churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward  Hellenizing the region.  And you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human  Rights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by  the Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation  of the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation,  Sidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of  Kefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina.  His employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in  24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his  involvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice  and remains without a job.   Helsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating  the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their  findings were published in a report titled    'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'  The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the  Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance,  the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in  Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against  the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the  Lausanne Convention.   The Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik were attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in Karotas was razed by bulldozers.  Shall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going  to take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The  discussion of human rights violations in Greece does not  stop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles  I shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks in Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.  It has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration  has an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made  plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it  has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on  conventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek  and Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned  to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the  transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern  Cyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of  the agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.  An acceptable method may certainly be found when there is a will. But we know of various kinds of violent behaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning of buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were  dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there.  Shots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.  Now wait, there is more.

The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus    and the 90 Turkish travellers, men and women who were in it ordered    to descend. And there in the open street, under the eyes of their    husbands, fathers and brothers, the women without distinction of age    were violated, and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst    the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi, a native of Tripoli, and a    captain whose name is not known, and to whom the Hellenic authorities    had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.     2. Before the battle, the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from    her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers, she was even stript    of her garments and her servant Assie was violated.     3. The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the    following manner: Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire    and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt    end of a gun.     4. During the firing of the town, eleven children, six little girls    and five boys, fleeing from the flames, were stopped by Greek soldiers    in the Ramazan Pacha quarter, and thrown into a burning Jewish house    near bridge, where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath    by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.     5. The clock-maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and    dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then    killed in the court of the Greek Church, but Ahmed Effendi has been    no more heard of.     6. At the market, during the fire, two unknown people were wounded    by bayonets, then bound together, thrown into the fire and burnt alive.     The Greeks killed also many Jews. These are the names of some:    Moussa Malki, shoemaker          killed   Bohor Levy, tailor               killed   Bohor Israel, cobbler            killed   Isaac Calvo, shoemaker           killed   David Aroguete                   killed   Moussa Lerosse                   killed   Gioia Katan                      killed   Meryem Malki                     killed   Soultan Gharib                   killed   Isaac Sabah                      wounded   Moche Fahmi                      wounded   David Sabah                      wounded   Moise Bensignor                  killed   Sarah Bendi                      killed   Jacob Jaffe                      wounded   Aslan Halegna                    wounded....>>  Serdar Argic\",\"Does anybody know the FTP site with the latest Windows drivers for the ATI GUP?

I see...  :-)   You can believe that if you wish.  It is undeniable, however, that people  have left the compound unharmed and alive earier in the standoff.  And since their leader was preaching that they would have an apocalypse, you  can not say undeniably that there wouldn't have been a mass suicide if the  FBI had simply stayed outside and waited another 51 days.   I am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense. You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this  compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless  to me.  I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't  stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me  sad and sick.   Have you ever heard of Jonestown? The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority  worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these  people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot  more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as  last year.   By all means, the FBI should be investigated, too.   BTW, I thought the second ammendment was God.  :-)   \",\"Hello all!  For few past days I've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync 3D (predecessor of 3FG) to work properly with the internal video of Mac IIvi.  With a VGA-adapter (as described in Dale Adams' posting about Quadra video) it works, only some minor interferences occur, small enough not to prevent any action on screen to be visible & clear.  But because the scanrates & stuff of 3D are well enough for emulating Apple 13\\\" RGB, I first made an adapter, then got one fron the local distributor of NEC. With both adapters I can get a picure, which looks excellent most of the time or every now and then. But with radical changes on screen (opening palettes, large windows etc.) there are major interferences in sync. The picture either tilts sideways or scrables up totally. Even when it is clear, there are some \\\"spiky\\\" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing pull-downs etc. With the self-made adapter, almost identical to the VGA one, only sense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a picture clear enough to shut down from menu... With the adapter from NEC, everything is well most of the time, but sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely lost. But not nearly as often as with the self-made one.  I know, with self made adapters there can always be interference, but with the one provided by NEC... where's the source of this interference?  I'll give you the pinouts of the whole mess, and I hope that you can, at least someone (please try =) figure out what could be the best pin assignment for NEC 3D. I am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and isolations, as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be arranged, especially syncs and groundings.

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.  Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise OED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument.  Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job.  Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \\\"It is raining\\\" or \\\"Today is Tuesday\\\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to be true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning of \\\"deny\\\", not the everyday meaning.  The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular arrangement of words used to express it.  So \\\"God exists\\\" and \\\"There exists a God\\\" both express the same proposition.  An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \\\"a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition\\\".  An argument consists of three stages.  First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions.   Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \\\"because\\\", \\\"since\\\", \\\"obviously\\\" and so on.  (The phrase \\\"obviously\\\" is often viewed with suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to question it.  You can always say \\\"Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious\\\" when you've heard the explanation.)  Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of valid inference.  The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \\\"implies that\\\" or \\\"therefore\\\".  Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as \\\"therefore\\\", \\\"it follows that\\\", \\\"we conclude\\\" and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.  For example:  Every event has a cause (premise) The universe has a beginning (premise) All beginnings involve an event (premise) This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference) Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)  Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.  Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example, the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated  afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if  sometimes a little confusing.  Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some statements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:  \\\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,  or the Son of God.\\\"  This is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its  conclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll come to those later.)  Another example:  \\\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\\\"  The phrase \\\"do your duty to God\\\" is not a proposition, since it is neither true nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an argument.  Finally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \\\"A because B\\\".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the statement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then it is not an argument, it is an explanation.  For example:  \\\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not  start.\\\" -- This is an argument.  \\\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\\\"  -- This is an explanation.  There are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions -- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion is true.  An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid; however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments, and about how probable their premises are.  There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.  It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly  counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more carefully.  Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions.  For example:     All insects have wings (premise)    Woodlice are insects (premise)    Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)  Here, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false.  If the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true.  The argument is thus entirely valid.  More subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises, as in:     All fish live in the sea (premise)    Dolphins are fish (premise)    Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)  However, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \\\"truth table\\\" for implication.  The symbol \\\"=>\\\" denotes implication; \\\"A\\\" is the premise, \\\"B\\\" the conclusion.  \\\"T\\\" and \\\"F\\\" represent true and false respectively.  Premise Conclusion Inference    A        B        A=>B ----------------------------    F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference    F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.     T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion                              false, the inference must be invalid.     T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,                              the conclusion must be true.  A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound  argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments.  To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.  In everyday English the term \\\"fallacy\\\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair enough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or convincing.  So for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive.  ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)  The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \\\"might makes right\\\".  The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.  For example: \\\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM  Argumentum ad hominem is literally \\\"argument directed at the man\\\".  The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.  For example: \\\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\\\"  Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by  showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not argumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's testimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).  The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent's particular circumstances.  For example: \\\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue otherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?\\\"  This is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent's argument.  This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For  example:  \\\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing.  You're white.\\\"  This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is also known as \\\"poisoning the well\\\".  ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM  Argumentum ad ignorantium means \\\"argument from ignorance\\\".  This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true, a basic scientific principle.)  Examples: \\\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\\\"  \\\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has shown any proof that they are real.\\\"  Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty.  Also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can  validly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:  \\\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water, even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no such flood occurred.\\\"  In science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred, however.  ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM  This is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is  committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a  conclusion accepted.  For example:  \\\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me guilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan.\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM  This is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language.  For example:  \\\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\\\"  \\\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM  This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more likely it is that that proposition is correct.  ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM  The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion.  For example:  \\\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\\\"  This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly between:  \\\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\\\" and \\\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent  computer\\\"  Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable  whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.  THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT  The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose \\\"accidental\\\" circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific.  For example:  \\\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must dislike atheists.\\\"  This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.  CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION  This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases.  For example: \\\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are insincere.\\\"  SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER  A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization.  NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  These are known as False Cause fallacies.  The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For  example:  \\\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God cured me of the headache.\\\"  The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For  example:  \\\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons.\\\"  CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.  PETITIO PRINCIPII  This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached.  CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO  This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:  \\\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job.  Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open to blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office.\\\"  Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the  conclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees.  Another example is the classic:  \\\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God.\\\"  COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION  This is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded  question:  \\\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\\\"  The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination, when they ask questions like:  \\\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\\\"  Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:  \\\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\\\" or \\\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\\\"  IGNORATIO ELENCHI  The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument  supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion.  For example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.  Sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light.  EQUIVOCATION  Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument.  For example:  \\\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\\\"  AMPHIBOLY  Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing.  ACCENT  Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case, the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized.  For example, consider:  \\\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\\\" and \\\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\\\"  FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION  One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole.  For example:  \\\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very  lightweight.\\\"  The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:  \\\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses.\\\"  FALLACY OF DIVISION  The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like its opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:  \\\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\\\"  The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item.  For example:  \\\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\\\"  THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT  This argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful events.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event.  For example: \\\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana.\\\"  \\\"A IS BASED ON B\\\" FALLACIES / \\\"IS A TYPE OF\\\" FALLACIES  These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.  Examples: \\\"Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of history?\\\"  \\\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a form of Christianity?\\\"  \\\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?\\\"  AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form \\\"A implies B, B is true, therefore A is true\\\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for implication given earlier.  DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form \\\"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\\\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy.  Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has the form \\\"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\\\", where A does NOT in fact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is invalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about B.  CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL  This fallacy is an argument of the form \\\"If A then B, therefore if B then A\\\".  ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM  This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old, or because \\\"that's the way it's always been.\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM  This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else.  ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM  The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those with more money are more likely to be right.  ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM  The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam.  ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM  This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard.  An \\\"argumentum ad nauseum\\\" is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something.  BIFURCATION  Also referred to as the \\\"black and white\\\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist.  PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS  This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question.  NON SEQUITUR  A non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it.  RED HERRING  This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the points being made, towards a different conclusion.  REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION  Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.  SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF  The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.  STRAW MAN  The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position, then to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made.  THE EXTENDED ANALOGY  The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two  different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a  claim that those situations are analogous to each other.  This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about  anti-cryptography legislation:  \\\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\\\"  \\\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported  Martin Luther King.\\\"  \\\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the  struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\\\"  TU QUOQUE  This is the famous \\\"you too\\\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:  \\\"You're just being randomly abusive.\\\" \\\"So?  You've been abusive too.\\\"\",\"  i would like to remind my jewish colleague mzm that much of the stories of the holocaust (including the ones in the u.s. holocaust memorial museum) were *not* eaten up by some of the papers.  we just have to wait to build muesums for it..    \",\":    Watch us soar in 1993!

Thanks a lot,  Joerg Haber \",\"   Is there any Israeli a civilian, in your opinion ?  Now, I do not condone myself bombing villages, any kind of villages. But you claim these are villages with civilians, and Iraelis claim they are  camps filled with terrorists. You claim that israelis shell the villages with the 'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad,  civilians die, right ? I am not so sure.   As somebody wrote, Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting manner. And he also claimed 'civilians murdered'. Let me ask you, isn't there  at least a slight chance that you (not only, and the question is very general,  no insult) are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in southern Lebanon ?  Now, a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil' kind of Mediteranean sea. How do you define Israeli soil ? From what you say, if you do not clearly  recognize the state of Israel, you condone killing israelis anywhere.   I do not know what was the pupose of the action you describe. If it was  to kill civilians (I doubt), I certainly DO NOT CONDONE IT. If civilians were  killed, i do not condone it.       Mr. Hernlem, it was YOU, not ME, who was showing a huge satisfaction for 3  israelis (human beings by most standards, Don't know about your standards) killed.  If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a  question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing justifies murder. I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ? Am I wrong ?   Now tell me, did you also condone Saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in, let's say, Tel Aviv ? From what I understand, a lot of palestineans cheered. What does it show? It does not qualify for freedom fighting to me ?

It takes of vertically.    For several reasons.  Vertical landings don't require miles of runway and limit noise pollution.  They don't require wheels or wings.  Just turn on the engines and touch down.  Of course, as Henry pointed out, vetical landings aren't quite that simple.   Well, to be blunt, yes.  But at least you're learning.   The Soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets just before they hit the ground.  Parachutes are, however, not especially practical if you want to reuse something without much effort.  The landings are also not very comfortable.

It is sometimes used as a framework to view Scripture.  But if you look at Collosions, without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be  a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.  against us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days, or the keeping of the sabbath.  The word for sabbath in this verse is \\\"sabbaton\\\" and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.  If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption \\\"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law\\\" then he will have to find some way around it, like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the 7tH day, Because \\\"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.\\\"  But Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal  statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings.  Also, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which talks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society that did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were slaves.

It seems to me from 1Cor 12 that God doesn't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all but that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a better question is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where God is trying to place me.  If a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church they go to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family of God. People should hop around from church to church as often as they hop from natural family to family.  If you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an  easily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are more like an orphan. Prayerfully go and \\\"leave yourself on a few doorsteps\\\" and see if anyplace feels like home.   I wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where you have difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other hand there are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of looking for problems you will both find them and make them. On the other hand if you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread that wherever you go.   In general, I think that God will try to place you in a church that talks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is expanding on that base.\",\" Gee!  Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something  I say can't be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \\\"scientific\\\"  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \\\"If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.\\\"    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \\\"There've got to be controlled studies\\\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying \\\"We don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.\\\"    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  \\\"Why should I prove your  theory?\\\"  and  \\\"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\\\"   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of  books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as I'm capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \\\"doctrinnaire\\\"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\": >NEWSPAPER AD CENSORSHIP : > : >San Fran.

I don't think it is the function overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time in BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered in porting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of invalid C++ assumptions.  I have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but the reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in which static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are getting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the owner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all other pieces of ctrltest work fine.  Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:  - The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,   rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ   between MSC and BC).  - All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++   assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place   of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for   references).  I am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have not encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope that some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS's hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that. \",\"    No....Hal McRae is the worst manager in baseball.

A tutorial will be on Thursday the 24th and the conference proper on the 25th with the annual meeting at the dinner on the evening between the two days.  All conference attendees are welcome at the annual meeting, though only Consortium members will be able to vote.  This year's theme is    Application Construction by Non-Programmers  Much of the effort on X toolkits has been aimed at programmer construction of applications.  There have, however, been some excellent UIMS systems built on top of X.  Papers addressing the theme will consider questions such as  What is needed for application construction by non-programmers?  Can we avoid programming altogether, or is a simple language needed?  Is it sufficient to create applications, or must users be able to create new widgets?  Should widgets and applications be able to print themselves?  Your participation in the conference is welcome.  Papers are appropriate on the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System, including   applications  experience with users  new objects  reviews of and proposals for revision of    internal Andrew protocols  We expect to have an RS/6000 with video projector available if you would like to do a demonstration.    Paper proposals should be submitted by 15 May 1993. Acceptance will be 1 June with final papers due by 15 June.

Here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects.  One is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related public relations campaign about Iran in recent months. These include:  1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade    Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not    succeeded in this. They, however, have indirectly created    the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist    Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.  2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and    other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and    outlaw state.  3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I     suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and    perhaps intensify.  Why this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have been behind this. These include:  1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical    Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This    movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily    fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this     movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return    colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of    democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian    military coup against the democratically elected Algerian    Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.    A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news    on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.  2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia    and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil    sources from this region.  3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense    expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of    Soveit Union.  The recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed from Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict of interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal and friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on the rise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran .\",\"Any comments of AMD microprocessors?  good?, bad?\",\" Who is the you Arabs here.

Say, for example, there are people living on a volcanic island, and a group  of geologists determine that a volcano is imminent. They warn the people on  the island that they are in danger, and should leave. A group of people on  the island is given the task of warning others of the danger.  They believe the danger is real, but others may not.   Does that mean that the first group are NECESSARILY arrogant in warning  others of the danger? Does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs  are correct, and all others are false?  Some might indeed react to opposition with arrogance, and behave in an  arrogant manner, but that is a personal idiocyncracy.

It draws nutrients from the soil through it's roots,  And gathers its force from the sun  It puts forth a whole lot of blossoms and fruit,  Then recedes itself when it is done.  Who programmed the seed to know just what to do?  And who put the sun in the sky?  And who put the food in the dirt for the roots?  And who told the bees to come by?

My father recently bought a business, the business price was 150,000 pounds and my father approached the people in the community for help, he raised 60,000 pounds in interest free loans from friends and relatives and  Muslims he knew, 50,000 had cash and the rest he got a business loan, after paying off the Muslim lenders many of them helped him with further loans to help him clear the bank debt and save him from further intrest, this is an example of a Muslim community helping one another, why did they help because of their common identity as Muslims. In turn my father has helped with people buying houses to minimise the amount of intrest they pay  and in some cases buy houses intrest free with the help of those more fortunate in the community.

I've been seeing  her every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28)  and during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every  4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period.  As it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that  though I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she  mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13  weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had  an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no  problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain  in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very  difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or  move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for  when I do need to go out.)   Anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from  the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about  2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.   (I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating  very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well  now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile  related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my  upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I  was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because  it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt   no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I  ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had  turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if  I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it  wasn't as much of a problem.  So the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid  fatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware  of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have  been avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat  foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.    But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat  except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts,  fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I  should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only  have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day (  potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in  a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or  steamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have  some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if  I'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it  from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if  she's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her  recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on  cholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She  originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the  entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I  started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and  she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also  asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them  are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain,  and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did  want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be  temporary for that one week.   What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I  would understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying  that anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she  assumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that  because of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to  use the energy from the food I do eat.   Any opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm  truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet  because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few  minutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I  don't find any foods satisfying.  Thanks \",\"Ed Campion Headquarters, Washington, D.C.                             April 23, 1993 (Phone:  202/358-1780)  Kyle Herring Johnson Space Center, Houston (Phone:  713/483-5111)  RELEASE:  93-76  HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS   The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability for an additional two, if needed.   The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times required using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual EVA tasks on previous missions.   \\\"Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the dynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,\\\" Mission Director Randy Brinkley said. \\\"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.\\\"   In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the spacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives during the mission.   \\\"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through lowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays, WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each spacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate,\\\" said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight Director for the mission.   While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than previous missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.   \\\"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,\\\" Heflin said.  \\\"In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible to accomplish the mission objectives.\\\"   Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions that include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated simulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone underwater training \\\"runs\\\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.   Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the mission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight will be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.   Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission. The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.   Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the experience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and trainers.   Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.   The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that time the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in 1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have become necessary.\",\"  I think we agree on much.  However the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of \\\"progress\\\" and \\\"rationality\\\" in science.  Since I've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past, I won't go into them again now.  What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps even the \\\"correct\\\") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes \\\"forward\\\" (and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the \\\"critical function\\\" of science.  (Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery. If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true of the application of any \\\"critical function\\\" concerning replication. This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an \\\"anything goes\\\" view.)  True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is *not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science.\",\"   Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else, one can get too much of a good thing.   Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries, essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her, necessarily.    Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected.     These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.    People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that \\\"pisses off\\\" their body. Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard, causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it.    See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly.  and brain damage.   The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin, and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.   poisoning.   Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating , say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home, plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of things.  But it might be the MSG.    If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.   Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.\",\" John 1:1 says (NKJV - the little green gideon someone forced on me one day) \\\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was  God.\\\"  The Word refers to Jesus Christ so from this John declares that God and Jesus are one.  Therefore, \\\"The Lord\\\" refers to both.  Also, David in the Psalms refers to both God in heaven and the coming messiah as his Lord.  Once again this refers to God and Jesus.     swear/curse?  Does it say anything about this in the bible?

However, to answer your question: The bible speaks of this in many places, A previous post to James is a good one.  Another is Psalm 15: \\\"Lord, who may abide in your tabernacle?  Who may dwell in your holy hill?  He who walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart He who does not backbite with his tongue, nor does evil to his neighbor, nor does he take up a reproach against his friend; I whose eyes a vile person is despised, but he honors those who fear the Lord; he who swears to his own hurt and does not change; He who does not put out money at usury, nor does he take a bribe aginst the innocent.

On 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe the last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolan pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his 939th base, which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot of publicity at Rickey's expense. IMO, Rickey deserves it, and it seems as most of the net agrees with me from what I've seen on it lately. They are both great players, but IMO, Nolan has outclassed Rickey, both in playing and more importantly, in attitude.

In other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice    but to obey.  This is a primary problem in the Church today.  What you are saying is more or less heresy.  You might call it \\\"infallibilism\\\".  It's the idea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does. This is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.  The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and well-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he can make mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.  A couple historical examples come to mind.  Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the English Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigning Pope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  Bishop Grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though maybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, even when they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would just collect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there. This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop Grosseteste was quite right in what he did!  Another example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages. He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific Vision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a defined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn't quite get around to defining it.  Now there's no way this is compatible with Catholic doctrine.  The Pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church. He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In the end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he recanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the Church.  If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such subjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you will find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall into heresy or schism.\",\" Gee.

About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes  under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement  of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of  the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced  the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor   suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.   While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being   manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently  increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (  palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part  the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had  been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the  pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is   persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3  and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides  minor reductions in pain and is only short term.     My questions are:        Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the      levels of pain?       Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?       Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?

In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called \\\"stolen hits\\\", defined as a play made that \\\"an average fielder would not make with average effort.\\\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \\\"Plays Kurt Stillwell would not have made.\\\"  OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by?  To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double Plays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).  Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't take it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article.  The short version -- definition of terms HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder NEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.

I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published  solutions to it.   The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw  the object we   1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively  computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume  that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not  exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable  measure. 2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment  of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two  triangles which will be filled in to color the surface. 3) Depth sort the triangles 4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw  and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is  along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge  colored with a special \\\"edge color\\\"   It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface. The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated. They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area.\",\"Panasonic KX-T3000H, Combo black cordless & speaker phone all in one.  new- $160, now- $100 + shipping OBO.

The  federal protection of individual rights supersedes the non-feasance of the state. Something similar has long been traditional ( well he's queer so I beat him up...) for gays   As Anatole France said; \\\"The law in its impartial majesty forbids the rich as well as the poor from sleeping under bridges.\\\"  Equality of law can be construed in any number of ways. For example the fact that all property thefts, regardless of value, are not punished equally is an inequality which protects those who have a lot of money from having it stolen. You could easily define equality to regard the property in terms of it's significance for the owner. This would a form of equality that would be skewed toward poorer people.  In fact, most anti-gay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal  protection. They make it an offense to damage people based on a  motivation of hatred for sexual orientation. Thus the law in its impartial majesty protects hets as well as gays from being bashed.

I   >don't know how a public-key system could work in this regard, but it might   [...]   heh heh... I posted this just before reading all the Clinton Chip messages..  I guess they beat me to it..  Anyway, I think it would be a great idea to  develop such a product, perhaps in the underground, as it would otherwise  probably become illegal pretty quickly here...  It's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's needed is a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codec functions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.  You'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and have a good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in the middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on a byte stream.  With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work.  Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.  At the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatible modems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on the cost of such a box.  In practice, you really ought to be able to get the price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nasty home RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I bought for 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software (which I don't).  The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one - the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip. Economics, I'm afraid.  However... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with the bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha) and the new NREN, it might then be trivial to run compressed speech over a tcp/ip connection on the Internet.  Perhaps we should start thinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible for everyone, and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet for all our phone calls in future :-)  [1/2 joking]\",\"****************************   SPHINX   ***************************   Sphinx is a user-friendly, state-of-the-art image processing and analysis package that runs across a spectrum of high performance  computer platforms operating UNIX and the X-Window System.   It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists  conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques.        Intuitive Graphic Interface   Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and  point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast.  This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image  layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.        Image Format Compatibility   Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.        Image Analysis & Processing   For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution  product or principal component analyses. An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions.        Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis   Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.). The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation, and 3-D image projection.        Easy External Program Interfacing   Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions.        Quick Quality Presentation   Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images, graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as  histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers.  Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external  graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?        Software Support & Development    Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)  of the Universite de Lille, France. The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features on-line help, is supported by an Internet address   sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and  version updates provided without delay.        Performance Tested    CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data  collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today, the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center and is widely used in many French laboratories, including the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure , Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire  de Meteorologie Dynamique.

I've been doing it my self over 200,000 miles, on my current toyota truck I've got over 150k. I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission. My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use?  On some old pieces of junk I drove, the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless. To date I've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy. Some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker & easier they where to shift.  My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window, I lightly press the accelerator & try agian. I've found that clutchless shifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000).

If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably be sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz per channel sampling rate.)  That level of analog multiplexing should be rather easy to accomplish.  Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without generating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner is in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to keep balanced.

The above certainly says a mouthful about the mindset of Ted Frank, and also of statists everywhere.\",\"Went to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night.   Astacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night. In the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then a single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the throw home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.   Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza batting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder and Webster.   Piazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards. The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by Offerman.   By the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but the score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive plays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner trying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base, etc.   Karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into the outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going through, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw to third and EASILY got the runner at third.   My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.   Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game with the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.   Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3 innings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning game had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh given his light work out Tuesday.   Gross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit to the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted in a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it 3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next thing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had scored long before that.   Meanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning. Lee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros and Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?). Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but that was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his third straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my free Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this up all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year.   The final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits. Dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.\",\" These new rule changes are great!  However, I think that your rules are MUCH too complicated.

The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were VERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise.  The biggest problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.  In almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outlets with the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things you can plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers they were a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memory periodically.  With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be less of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longer recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their equipment.

Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.

The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is public-key cryptography? * What's RSA? * Is RSA secure? * How fast can people factor numbers? * What about other public-key cryptosystems?   * What is public-key cryptography?    In a classic cryptosystem, we have encryption functions E_K and   decryption functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for any plaintext   P. In a public-key cryptosystem, E_K can be easily computed from some   ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published, so   that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed   from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.   That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie   and Hellman in 1976.    In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to   send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than   them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,   and you don't have to worry about spies.    This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an   extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,   applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the   mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.  * What's RSA?    RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and   Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at   RSA.COM. Here's a small example.    Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples   (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,   and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We   define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.    Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as   anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair   (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a   secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.  * Is RSA secure?    Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.   See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization   algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to   prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that   matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by   ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,   ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to   prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and   theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative   results.''  * How fast can people factor numbers?    It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra   and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three   weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;   each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The   algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a   bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers   n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in   any case.    An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple   polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n   log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,   but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100   and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.    Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few   years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are   developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from   factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number   field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic   sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)  * What about other public-key cryptosystems?\",\"It seems to me that all discussions about Clipper security are almost  irrelevant - if I cannot choose the key, but have to use a key chosen for me by the foundry, the security of the WHOLE UNIVERSE OF USERS is as good (or as bad) as the security of VLSI Technologies Inc.

Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news     frequently.       WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?      The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).      The \\\"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\\\" ASC G&C 2102,   \\\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is  commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower  clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)  orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a  negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other  advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort  maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of  the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining  downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target  in second stage.\\\"      This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try     to interpret.      1) We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2) Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack  between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the  \\\"relative wind\\\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line  between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly  negative angle (\\\"a negative q-alpha\\\"). This causes a little bit of  \\\"downward\\\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z  direction) and this force \\\"alleviates structural loading.\\\"  We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the  most \\\"delicate\\\" part of the vehicle.      3) The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more  mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or  to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be  the case if we didn't roll (\\\"performance gain\\\").      4) The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated  flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort  maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\\\"decreased abort maneuver  complexity\\\").      5) The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio  antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio  antennae on the Orbiter (\\\"improved S-band look angles\\\").      6) The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a  helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7) The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is  more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east  (usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity  in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:  velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.  The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its  velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question, \\\"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?\\\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \\\"top\\\"     [Orbiter side] and the \\\"bottom\\\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the     Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics. He added that the \\\"roll     maneuver\\\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.     The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a \\\"quaternion,\\\" a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.       HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT      NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite     dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72     degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed     over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from     California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.     It's worth asking if yours doesn't.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.

CONTROLLER VS9         The function of VS-9 controller is to load TV-images into  PC/AT.        VS-9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV-frame from        a field of 724x600 pixels.        The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in        the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image. This        provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal        and vertical directions.        The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.        Video signal capture time - 2.5s.                       CONTROLLER VS52         The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM        PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was        created on the base of modern elements, including user        programmable gate arrays.        The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different        resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change        technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any        other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning        devices).        The controller has the following technical characteristics:        - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;        - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64        to 1024x512 pixels ;        - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024        pixels;        - video signal capture time - 40 ms.        - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024        pixels ;        - number of gray level - 256 ;        - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;        - 4 input video multiplexer ;        - input/output lookup table (LUT);        - possibility to realize \\\"scroll\\\" and \\\"zoom\\\";                     - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external        controlling signal) ;        - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -        digital converter;        - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.

National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even   hole filling.    The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.    GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,   documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been   developed by Spyglass.

It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,   tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting   things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of   images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined   convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw   data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also   does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,   though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac   that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version   from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)  PhotoMac --------   Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700  PhotoPress ----------   Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973  PixelTools and TCL-Image ------------------------   \\\"Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications   software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

It is easily   extensible through \\\"script\\\" (or indirect command) files. These script   files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are   executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.   The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame   grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides   conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF.\\\"    Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville, TN 37933 615-966-9200  Satellite Image Workshop ------------------------   It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all   sorts of image enhancing on it. You'll need at least a Mac II with co-   processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn't   run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1    In the documentation the contact address is given as:  Liz Smith, Jet   Propulsion Laboratory, MS 300-323, 4800 Oak Grove Dr,.Pasadena, CA 91109   (818) 354-6980  Visualization Workbench -----------------------   \\\"An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image   analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting.\\\"    Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112  Adobe Photoshop ---------------    The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey   scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,   blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,   EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,   PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the \\\"auto selection tool\\\"   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close   hues, color range and mask.

Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283  Digital Darkroom ----------------   The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and   editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by \\\"painting\\\" it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator \\\"paint\\\" with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd., Suite J San Diego, CA   92126 619-695-6956  Dimple ------   It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or   II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has   the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image   enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and   unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations.

Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: \\\"Laplacian, medium noise filter\\\", etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,   the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu   (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)   Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,   VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic, etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is   available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - \\\"AIPS++\\\" - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and   Australia to name a few.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using   the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Been around for   a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000   with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display\\\"  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil   exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual   pages, and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.   For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun   console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X   windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of   convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]    MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,    byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or    without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,    line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp    masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,    line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan    bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to    region target mean, median, or modal value. o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,    brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive    background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical    aperture shape to image isophotes.  o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot    of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`    centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,    change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and    adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function    or histogram equalization. o  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for    registration. o  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or    2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers    can be cycled through. Interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting,    point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and    quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights    or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass    back to calling function. Dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars)    to file or printer.  Change to user specified coordinate system. o  Tricolor image combination and display, hardcopy halftone printout to    HP-PCL compatible printers (Laserjet, deskjet, etc.) o  Documentation is over 300 pages in custom vinyl binder.

In fact, a calf _must_ have a sufficient amount of colostrum (early milk) within 12 hours to effectively develop the immune system, since for the first (less than) 24 hours the intestines are \\\"open\\\" to the IG passage.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages.

[AFS]     Just a quick comment:: [AFS] [AFS]     Armenians killed Turks------Turks killed Armenians. [AFS] [AFS]     Simple as that. Can anybody deny these facts?  Jews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was  quite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi  revisionists say!  [SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in [SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups) [SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother. [SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were  [SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy  [SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not  [SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.  OK.  [SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my [SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these  [SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe  [SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people, [SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...  There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the Armenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno- Georgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever  killed in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of Anatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian- Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after the Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the extermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died in this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of preparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish  genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers away!  [SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people [SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women', [SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed [SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these  [SY] people not to hate all Armenians.   I don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.  [SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region, [SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation. [SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some [SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts. [SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish [SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with [SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately [SY] very easy to start a fire!  Again, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to do with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that the Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan,  and Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through  Tiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians  militarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of Caucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement  caused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years  earlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek ->  Erzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople ->  Massachusetts.   [SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people.

Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves [SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.  My grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste potato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian young man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential, local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive  today.  [SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense. [SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But [SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before.

The show hosts are pretty good about handling these guys, but it's still annoying.

I can resolve to abstain from  sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail. I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided  the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation. If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.  To willingly judge \\\"others\\\" as deserving punishment seems to me to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.      So what's the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in \\\"deviant\\\" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS of deviant sexual behavior with HIV+ people and never be infected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors, many of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors carry the risk of transmission.      The end of all things is to know, love and serve God, growing daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  Even so I could get AIDS.  Anyone could, unless they remain forever celibate, IV-drug-free, and transfusion free.

The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to ten megatons yield behind a \\\"pusher plate\\\" attached to the main spacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the ship.    Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave into the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton, helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission products).    Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once they're there.    I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?    Thanks.  --   --Jim \",\"Just an apology in advance for posting a binary to this newsgroup. I've had several attempts to mail it to the original poster but  it's not getting through intact. \",\"    The following is from a critique of a \\\"60 Minutes\\\" presentation on MSG    which was aired on November 3rd, 1991.  The critique comes from THE TUFTS    DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]   \\\"Chances are good that if you watched '60 Minutes' last November  3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In  the segment entitled 'No MSG,' for instance, show host Ed Bradley  makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them  ('millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently  sick'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven  personal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the  substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive   those studies are.   Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to  a study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order  to back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that MSG,  a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as  in many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT  make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on  humans but on rabbits.   One of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist  Patricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that  a small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get   headaches from it.  'But,' she explains, 'the show probably   overemphasized the extent of the problem.'   A second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor  at the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley  remarks, 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory  animals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' because  it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney's  research with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human  youngsters.   In fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney's   experiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected  extremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing   their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,  and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance  to very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither  of those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG   with food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by  enzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little  reaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human  blood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations  found in Dr. Olney's lab animals.....   The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of  that fact.  And so does the European Communities' Scientific  Committee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,  have concluded that MSG is safe.   Their determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never  been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed  to it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a  burning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe  of clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently  exonerated the much-maligned substance.   That's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of  monosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever  we eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one  of the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken  down into glutamate during digestion.   It's a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the  most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes  up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in  milk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.   That doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small number  of people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore  sensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international  professional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus  reached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large.\\\" \",\" Do people expect the Texans congressmen to act as the N.J.

The issue wasn't gays, but the principles were the same. Thanks for a well put testimonial. Stan Krieger and his kind who think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the only acceptable position in scouting should take notice. The BSA has been hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts haven't given up. Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that scouting is still worth fighting for.  On a cautionary note, you must realize that if your experience with this camp leader was in the BSA you may be putting him at risk by publicizing it.

Professional group, with primary  membership of major aerospace firms. Headquartered in the DC area.  Acts as the \\\"voice of the aerospace industry\\\" -- and it's opinions  are usually backed up by reams of analyses and the reputations of  the firms in AIA.       [address needed]      AIAA -- American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.  Professional association, with somewhere about 30,000-40,000  members. 65 local chapters around the country -- largest chapters  are DC area (3000 members), LA (2100 members), San Francisco (2000  members), Seattle/NW (1500), Houston (1200) and Orange County  (1200), plus student chapters. Not a union, but acts to represent  aviation and space professionals (engineers, managers, financial  types) nationwide. Holds over 30 conferences a year on space and  aviation topics publishes technical Journals (Aerospace Journal,  Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, etc.), technical reference books  and is _THE_ source on current aerospace state of the art through  their published papers and proceedings. Also offers continuing  education classes on aerospace design. Has over 60 technical  committees, and over 30 committees for industry standards. AIAA acts  as a professional society -- offers a centralized resume/jobs  function, provides classes on job search, offers low-cost health and  life insurance, and lobbies for appropriate legislation (AIAA was  one of the major organizations pushing for IRAs - Individual  Retirement Accounts). Very active public policy arm -- works  directly with the media, congress and government agencies as a  legislative liaison and clearinghouse for inquiries about aerospace  technology technical issues. Reasonably non-partisan, in that they  represent the industry as a whole, and not a single company,  organization, or viewpoint.   Membership $70/yr (student memberships are less).

An awful lot of the starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.  Perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children are dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the supposed \\\"Pro-Life\\\" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against abortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more of those by fighting for human rights in China.  And besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory forced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case. \",\"Anyone in Europe got any advice for a US citizen whose going to be living and working in Italy for a year and wants to buy a motorcycle there?

I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using XPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay around when the window is refreshed.  Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with:     /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */    /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */    palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;    palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;    palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;    XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);    XFlush( myDisplay);     XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);    XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);  Then to draw I do:     XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);    XFlush( myDisplay);  And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do:     XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);   What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of whatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are over a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxor function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases and redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).

Note: cryptography is generally not well integrated into email yet   and some system proficiency is required by users to utilize it.  _____ <4.3> What is the cypherpunks mailing list?    Eric Hughes <hughes@toad.com> runs the `cypherpunk' mailing list   dedicated to ``discussion about technological defenses for privacy   in the digital domain.''  Send email to   cypherpunks-request@toad.com to be added or subtracted from the   list. From the charter:    > The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption.   > To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  But to encrypt   > with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for   > privacy. Cypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will   > learn how best to defend it.  _____ <4.4> What are some privacy-related newsgroups?  FAQs?

Balenson     <belenson@tis.com>    Send email to pem-info@tis.com for more information.  See ``RFCs    related to privacy'' for information on how to obtain RFCs.    _____ <4.6> What are other Requests For Comments (RFCs) related to privacy?    RFC-822:  SMTP, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol   RFC-977:  NNTP, Network News Transfer Protocol   RFC-1036: Standard for interchange of network news messages   RFC-1208: Glossary of Networking Terms   RFC-1207: Answers to ``experienced Internet user'' questions   RFC-1206: Answers to ``new Internet user'' questions   RFC-1355: Privacy issues in Network Information center databases       RFC-1177 is ``FYI: Answers to commonly asked ``new internet user''    questions, and includes: basic terminology on the Internet (TCP/IP,   SMTP, FTP), internet  organizations such as IAB (Internet   Activities Board) and IETF  (Internet Enbgineering Task Force), and   a glossary of terms.  Also from ftp.eff.org:   /pub/internet-info/internet.q.    > RFCs can be obtained via FTP from NIC.DDN.MIL, with the pathname   > RFC:RFCnnnn.TXT or RFC:RFCnnnn.PS (where `nnnn' refers to the   > number of the RFC).

The first line of the text of the message must be `SEND   > RFCnnnn.TXT-1', where nnnn is replaced by the RFC number.    _____ <4.7> How can I run an anonymous remailer?    Cypherpunk remailer source is at soda.berkeley.edu in the   /pub/cypherpunks directory.  It's written in PERL, and is   relatively easy to install (no administrative rights are required).   Karl Barrus  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> has more information and   modifications. Also, most remailer operators mentioned above are   amenable to discussing features, problems, and helping new sites   become operational. Address all points in the section   ``responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to   advertising your service.  You should be committed to the long-term   stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously.  _____ <4.8> What are references on privacy in email?

For more   information send email to crosslink@athena.mit.edu.   MISCELLANEOUS =============  _____ <5.1> What is ``digital cash''?    With digital encryption and authentication technologies, the   possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be   realized.  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks   (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may   be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and   anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an   economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum   (~Dec.1992).    An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus   <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the   cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to   elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:      ::     command: help          user@host    where `user@host' is your email address.      _____ <5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?    These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,   especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past   a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as   breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most   internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a   ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,   curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a   system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and   patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also   the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.     _____ <5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?    From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:    > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were   > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy   > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,   > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant   > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people   > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,   > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek   > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or   > their opinions.    See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.    See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary   in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.  _____ <5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?    Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the   techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication   but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself.    Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the   proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible   to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,   typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is   posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually   untraceable  communication can take place between sender and   receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic   realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where   individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual   users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An   anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman   (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to   <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following   commands in the subject line:      subscribe     unsubscribe     help  _____ <5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?    `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain   protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information   or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make   public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade   `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be   concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in   operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that   some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious   because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This   argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet   posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a   very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at   worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ   for alt.security.        Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic   Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First   International Symposium on National Security & National   Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:    > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep   > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's   > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If   > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there   > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I   > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into   > an environment where any information which is at all interesting   > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little   > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,   > but you may differ...  _____ <5.6> What are `identity daemons'?      RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to   query a remote user's login name after connection to a local   communication socket (a connection of this type is established   during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not   widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement   it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to   anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system   adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a   trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.  _____ <5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?     Remailing/Posting   -----------------      - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,     publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.   - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET     postings.   - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information     obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,     encrypted addresses, etc.)   - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and     remailer site chaining.      General   -------      - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy     shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the     general public and their governments.   - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies      by systems designers into     hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'     `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.   - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than     wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement     agencies.   - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government     agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to     strengthening and protecting it.   ISSUES ======  _____ <6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?    From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:    > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic   > media which connect us.  Computer-based communication media like   > electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis   > of new forms of community.  These communities without a single,   > fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an   > electronic frontier.   >    > While well-established legal principles and cultural norms give   > structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like   > newspapers, books, and telephones, the new digital media do not   > so easily fit into existing frameworks.  Conflicts come about as   > the law struggles to define its application in a context where   > fundamental notions of speech, property, and place take   > profoundly new forms. People sense both the promise and the   > threat inherent in new computer and communications technologies,   > even as they struggle to master or simply cope with them in the   > workplace and the home.   >    > The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been established to help   > civilize the electronic frontier; to make it truly useful and   > beneficial not just to a technical elite, but to everyone; and to   > do this in a way which is in keeping with our society's highest   > traditions of the free and open flow of information and   > communication.      EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor, founder of   Lotus software, and John Barlow, lyricist for the Grateful Dead   rock band.  A highly publicized endeavor of the organization   involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI   raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``Steve   Jackson Games'').  The foundation publishes EFF News (EFFector   Online) electronically, send requests to effnews-request@eff.org.      In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee   with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated   November 5, 1991,  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented   Mitchell Kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national   public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly   by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' (complete text in    ftp.eff.com:/pub/pub-infra/1991-12):    > ...we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to   > work with other sectors of the communications industry to create   > a consumer-oriented, public information network. Please let me or   > my staff know what policies you and others in the computer   > industry believe would best serve the public interest in creating   > a reasonably priced, widely available network in which   > competition is open and innovation rewarded.  I also want to   > learn what lessons from the computer industry over the past ten   > to fifteen years should apply to the current debate on   > structuring the information and communications networks of the   > future....I ask your help in gaining input from the computer   > industry so that the Subcommittee can shape policies that will   > bring this spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship to the   > information services industry.      ftp.eff.org   ===========      /pub/eff/about-eff   ---     A file of basic information about EFF including goals, mission,     achievements, and current projects.

The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility have been   working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues   since ~1982.  The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,   Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation   against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other   U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation   on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,   NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in   Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on   Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to   testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and   caller identification.    CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available   via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising   the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For   more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.     (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions   here.)  _____ <6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?    In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies   on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in   such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.      (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):    > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May   > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card   > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success.    > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying   > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of   > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some   > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department   > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide   > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of   > jurisdictions.    Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated   instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a   crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal   search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of   Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST   by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science   Fiction Magazine:    > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional   > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the   > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared   > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,   > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin   > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only   > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place.    > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that   > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document   > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.    FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed   on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier   Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe   Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:      > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret   > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal   > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a   > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,   > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment.    >    > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in   > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,   > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke   > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer   > seizure policies.  While the Service has seized dozens of   > computers since the crackdown began in 1990, this is the first   > case to challenge the practice.    >    > Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin   > science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never   > suspected of a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal   > research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and   > the suspected illegal activities of an employee, or to determine   > that the company was a publisher. Indeed, agents testified that   > they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the   > special Secret Service school on computer crime.    >    > \\\"How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what   > Steve Jackson Games did, what it was?\\\" asked Sparks. \\\"An hour?    >    > \\\"Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to   > Steve Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything   > taken?    >    > \\\"Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had   > a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen   > -- saying he was a computer crime suspect?    >    > \\\"Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material   > could harm Steve Jackson economically?\\\"    >    > Foley replied, \\\"No, sir,\\\" but the judge offered his own answer.    >    > \\\"You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go   > out and hire a lawyer and sue you.\\\"    >    > More than $200,000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier    > Foundation in bringing the case to trial.

ISDN is a high-speed data communications standard that utilizes   existing copper telephone lines, and is a possible inexpensive and   intermediate alternative to laying fiber optic cable for phone   networks.  The speeds involved may be sufficient for audio and   video transmission applications.  G.

FOOTNOTES =========   _____ <7.1> What is the background behind the Internet?     The article ``Internet'' in Fantasy and Science Fiction by Bruce   Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> contains general and nontechnical   introductory notes on origins of the Internet, including the role   of the RAND corporation, the goal of network resilience in face of   nuclear attack, MIT, UCLA, ARPANET, TCP/IP, NSF, NREN, etc.:    > ARPANET itself formally expired in 1989, a happy victim of its    > own overwhelming success.  Its users scarcely noticed, for   > ARPANET's  functions not only continued but steadily improved.    > The use of  TCP/IP standards for computer networking is now   > global.  In 1971, a  mere twenty-one years ago, there were only   > four nodes in the  ARPANET  network.  Today there are tens of   > thousands of  nodes in  the Internet,  scattered over forty-two   > countries, with more coming  on-line every day.

Last year the Internet was growing at   > a rate of  twenty percent a *month.*  The number of `host'   > machines with direct  connection to TCP/IP has been doubling   > every year since  1988.

Depends really on the surrounding system and whether you are talking ARM6x or ARM6xx (the latter has a cache, and so is essential to run at this kind of speed with slower memory).  I'll stop saying things there 'cos I'll hopefully be working for ARM after graduation...

The lunar-orbit mission was an afterthought, after Hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten during a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion into lunar orbit couldn't be positively confirmed.  It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takes a long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit. If you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit, you do have to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel, although it is reduced from what you'd need for the brute-force approach.\",\"Has anyone noticed or commented on the fact that so many of those who were willing, nay demanding, that we wait forever for Mr Hussein and Iraq, that we use tremendously costly \\\"sanctions\\\", to avoid a loss of life, are now at the fore front of those clammoring that we should have smashed those \\\"religious radicals\\\" and we were wasting money allowing this stand off to go on  ?

X X XGOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X    * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X XRULES: X X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules: X X    1) Your entry must be a complete program. X X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or } X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536. X X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format: X X---entry--- Xrule: 1993 Xfix: y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry) Xtitle: title of entry        (see comments below) Xentry: Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0) Xdate: Date/time of submission in UTC     (see comments below) Xhost: Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested X Use tab indented lines if needed X---remark--- X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author--- Xname: your name Xorg: School/Company/Organization Xaddr: postal address X use tab indented lines to continue X don't forget to include the country Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain. X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines. Xanon: y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info) X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X * The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X   and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X   It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X   incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X   consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X * The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X   to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()  X   using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X * You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X   it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the  X   ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same  X   title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be  X   sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X * With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above  X   format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X   something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X   Email message to the judges. X X * Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless  X   'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X * To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X   each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X   should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X * The entry's remarks should include: X     - what this program does X     - how to run the program (sample args or input) X     - special compile or execution instructions, if any X     - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X     - information about any ---data--- files X     - why you think the program is obfuscated X     - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X     - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X * Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X   portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They  X   should not be required to exist. X X   If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X   section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple  X   ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X   each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X    'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X    'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X        digit, followed by '.c' X    your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X        title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not  X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to: X X  ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate X  obfuscate@toad.com X X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'. X X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however. X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC. X X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry X       must be sent in a separate Email letter. X X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.   X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed. X X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user, X       special owner or group) are not allowed.

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers  X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with  X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor  X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X * look at the original source X * convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X * run it through a C beautifier X * examine the algorithm X * lint it X * compile it X * execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting \\\"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake\\\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X #define d define X #d foo     <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X int i; X j;     <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you  X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in  X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X int i; X char *c; X i[c];     <--- use c[i] instead X (i+3)[\\\"string\\\"];   <--- use \\\"string\\\"[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X * assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X * casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X * passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X * passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X * performing arithmetic on va_list variables X * using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X * are very hardware specific X * are very OS or Un*x version specific X      (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X       code is likely not to be) X * dump core or have compiler warnings X      (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X * won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X * abusing the build file to get around the size limit X * obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X * are longer than they need to be X * are similar to previous winners X * are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X * are as concise and small as they need to be X * do something at least quasi-interesting X * pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X * are portable X * are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X * MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X * make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X where this program differs from the contest rules, the X contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

If an entry wins, we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition, X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award, X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X * Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X * Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X  cc prog.c -o special_name  need special binary X X     or  rm -f special_src.c   need special source X  cp prog.c special_src.c X  cc special_src.c -o special_name X X     or  rm -f special_build   need special build X  tail +4 build > special_build X  sh < special_build X X * Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of  X   your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You  X   should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the  X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X     X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer  X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as  X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many  X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X date -u \\\"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\\\" X date -u | sed -e 's/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/' X sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X ---entry--- section X all ---author--- sections X all ---info--- sections X ---build--- section X ---program--- section X any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X * reading the ---entry--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X * passing the source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X * performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X * passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X * linting the source X * compiling/building the source X * running the program X * performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X * best small one line program X * best small program X * strangest/most creative source layout X * most useful obfuscated program X * best game that is obfuscated X * most creatively obfuscated program X * most deceptive C code X * best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X * best abuse of ANSI C X * worst abuse of the rules X * <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry  X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,  X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X     comp.lang.c    comp.unix.wizards alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X     comp.sources.d   alt.sources.d  misc.misc X     comp.sources.misc   comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners  X    have appeared in books (\\\"The New Hackers Dictionary\\\") and on T-Shirts. X X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-) X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X X    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.

Plus extras like hot showers, Tours, a Concourse  D'Elegance and more.     This is first time in the 49'er Rally's 20-year history that the   event is being held in Quincy.  And according to Pat Gardner, Rally Chairman,  \\\"The 49'er Rally's continuing growth and the need for a larger and more  complete facility led us to Quincy.

For pre-registration forms and additional information, write Doug  Hubbard, BMW Club of Northern California, 41236 Norman Court, Fremont, CA  94539, or telephone <US> (510) 651-2195   ADDITIONAL NOTES::     This is a not for profit event and riders DO get their monies worth.    Whether you've ever attended a rally before or not This is the one    to make.  The only problem has been that there are so    many activities that attendees have to choose one over another.     Quincy is a beautiful campground, lots of grass and little dust.    For folks who have been to previous 49'er rallies at Mariposa,     Quincy has lots of space, all of it flat so room is not a problem.    There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather.    Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us.     Registration will begin on thursday.  Of course there are always early    arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays    for camping Thursday through Monday (5 days).  There will be a tour Friday    with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the    awards ceremony.  \",\"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----        >So, don't just think of replacements for clipper, also think of front    >ends.

Come on, Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant. Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders.   YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**. Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.  But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel doesn't have a game like that in him.   Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about Roussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah, Dom has played well too.   FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a team picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the same picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning, Kasper...   Mostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain autographs on the team photos. I don't like that method since I've seen guards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they got their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies.\",\"Following a series of miscarriages, my wife was given a transfusion of my white cells. (The theory as I understand it is that there is some kind of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as it normally would a \\\"foreign\\\" body.

Originally I was inspired by the NAPLPS graphics standard (a summary of  which hit this group about 2 weeks ago).  Following up on software availability of NAPLPS supporting software I find that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being PP3 which runs soley on MSDOS machines leaving Mac and Amiga users to buy full commercial software if they want to try out the BBS (I know I wouldn't)  Next most interesting possibility is to port MGR to PC, Mac, Amiga. I know there is an old version of a Mac port on bellcore.com that doesn't work under System 7 But I can't seem to find the source anywhere to see if I can patch it.  Is there a color version of MGR for Linux?  I know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year but I misplaced it.  Does anyone on this group know if MGR as been ported to PC or Amiga ?

It *does* make a difference whether the speculation is well-founded or not.     Though this is a good point.  The one speculation is \\\"safer\\\", because it can be reversed.\",\"  I think you missed one of my points there.  It takes *more* than a great GM to win a stanley cup, even once.  Some of the guys on the list you gave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey- that is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better  than yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original post (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not the coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:   I think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved here which transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for  us to say, \\\"He should hire a different coach.\\\"  In fact, he has talked about doing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to  prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second round.  He needs to, as the papers say, \\\"get that monkey off his back.\\\" So it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all a little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will improve as a result.  I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how good of a GM he really is.   I may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussing it with you. \",\"   Is the so-called material world \\\"outside\\\" the Kingdom of God?

(other than wuarchive, umich,.. something off the beaten path??)\",\" (excerpts from posting on this topic)    (I've seen satellites at midnight - they're not only in twilight.) :o)    Now my comments:   I'd like to add that some of the \\\"protests\\\" do not come from a strictly  practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for  research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend, \\\"getting away from it all\\\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters  much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.   But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't  fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever -  like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch  commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,  truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.    To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage  of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at  8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it  if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could  be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that  as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,  even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. \",\"Sender:  Reply-To: harmons@gyro.WV.TEK.COM (Harmon Sommer) Distribution:  Organization: /usr/ens/etc/organization Keywords:     Unless they have been taught to \\\"neck rein\\\".

John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400% does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus, before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is.   The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a player who gets an out gets a \\\"negative probability\\\" in most cases. Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes, they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also, the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given them a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.       No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score  in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The offence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.           No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look, if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers, fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \\\"negative chance\\\" that the team would win.   From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda. At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really does not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens. So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to player performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15% on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%. I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.  How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's, etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more valuble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better  pitcher?  They were probably about the

Follow the parts that you think are suitable for modern life. Ignore the others. For heaven's (!) sake don't take it literally.      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   So you think it is easy to be a Muslim? Or be a Buddhist? The Buddha's commandments are 500 yrs older than Christ's and in my opinion tougher to follow. Moreover the Buddha says that we are  intrinsically good (as against Christ's \\\"we are all sinners\\\").  Only we allow ourselves to be distracted. By meditating we can awaken  ourselves (etc etc). Also there is no concept of God in Buddhism.  (In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist). But to \\\"awaken\\\" yourself is no easy task. Can you stay away from eating meat? Can you sit still and think of nothing (meditate) for sometime everyday? Buddhists do (or are supposed to). Can you pray five times a day?  Can you fast for a month every year (Ramzan). Are you willing to give 1/6 th of your income as tithe? Muslims do. In fact I think  Jesus was an ordinary man (just as Buddha and Mohamed) probably with a  philosopy ahead of the times (where he lived).  Considering the fact that Christianity is a young religion (compared to Hindiusm, Judaism, Zorasterism, Buddihsm) it is also very probable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas. (There was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and the middle east at the time of Christ). And perhaps some more.

I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my  childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes.   I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very  angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It  carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some  time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and  `Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To  become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would  consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared  to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a  better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable  riches of knowing Christ.  As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that  they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time  they had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They  didn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.   For example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.    When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her  death, she said to me, \\\"As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew.\\\"  What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a  Jew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with  matzoh balls.:-))   I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My  sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who  do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people  Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.  This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their  experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while  following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.    I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.   It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have  a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small  sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it  and do not want to ask for it back.  And while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.   I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the  Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is  that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again,  being rooted in the past.   This is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess  around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of  Easter).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.  I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all  believers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish  Christian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. \",\" XGA or XGA-2?

All is not lost, however, as you still might belong spiritually to the Church by your desire to belong to it.  As you said, only God can judge the condition of a man's soul.  About judgment, on the other hand, St. Paul  1 Cor 5:12) urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians.  Following the Apostle's teaching, I judge that you should reconsider    returning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  He is the God who lives.    Concerning what you were told about non-believers when you were a catholic, that is true.  As I have posted before, Vatican II (Lumen Gentium, II,    n. 16) teaches: \\\"Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Chruch, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and moved by grace, try in their actions to do His will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation.\\\"    Responding to your solicitation for opinions on the thinking processes of God, the best I can do is refer you to Scripture.

It's more likely that the Moon will never be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch,  and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat  sink capacity could offer some military utility for \\\"high ground\\\" military weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space  travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as  Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor  activity in the global scope of things.  Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to prevent calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it's too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink, and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.  We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few centuries, if not much longer.  Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument. The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for conventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from a bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little ultimate profit either.

Well, think again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple computer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:  In the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort by Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple's attention a problem with certain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice \\\"stick\\\" in the down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the machine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the reported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of BCGA65431. You'll recognize this \\\"sticky button\\\" symptom immediately if you have such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle.  Liam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead  suggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly (_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described my defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told Apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of warranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering where my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the serial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed) range Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.  Nothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make it worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice. Please, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don't assume you know what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start hacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it. Please take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:                    United States      1-800-776-2333                   Canada             800-665-2775                   UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01                   Australia          61-2-452-8000                   Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500  If the number isn't toll-free, call collect.

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.  Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch.  That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game, Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about  winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch.  Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible.  Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games.  I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.  But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan.    -- The Beastmaster   \",\"A few comments on the ATF's botched handling of this case:  1. Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation    we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult    members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit    of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,    you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule    is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is    incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.  2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were    outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When    questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault    was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were    thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew    you could!  3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,    hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and    referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm    more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not    related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up    some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's    now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by    the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I    was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI    agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say    uncomplimentary.  4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that    the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the    reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing    this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references    to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around    the \\\"He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\\\"    flag.  Sigh.  5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege    reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought    processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button    because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My    only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to    the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to    an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in    the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the    forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In    that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones    Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:    Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and    other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the    BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have    been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it    was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's    paranoid delusions.     --   #include <std_disclaimer.h>\",\" actually,  teh D means the registered driver has diplomatic immunity.

The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away, heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this moment is hazy.  I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not. So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!  Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.  What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?  I eagerly await comment.

NEWSPOT, January 1993   MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.  Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.    Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine.    Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly magazine  \\\"ENA\\\"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek general election.    Bulev said in the interview: \\\"I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.\\\" Sideropoulos said  in the  article that \\\"Greece  should recognise Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the border, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC are falling.\\\"    The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court summons,  was   that  \\\"they  have   spread...intentionally  false information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the citizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the international interests of the country (Greece).\\\"    The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian.    In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000 in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.    Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian human rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live.    Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent, especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.    Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections are over.  Serdar Argic\",\" This is a ridiculous argument for being a Christian.

In keeping with more classic command and control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.

I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens, and not multiple X displays.   Given this:   - Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple  as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's  nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between  screens?   - Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate  screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there?

I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a \\\"fake\\\" Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data.  Quest 1. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.) I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?  Quest 2. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever.

They have healthier starting pitchers (so far, at least) and better relievers.  I see no reason why they shouldn't win ~85 games.  Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles and the Tigers *still* have no pitching.

From all I've heard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg- ressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car at the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that he grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in Germany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic). What you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due to fear':  When driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody fails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can go (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :). So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex- posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to handle it - or you lose...  That's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation -  whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to the volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more people (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened) and each accident is one accident too much.   Better designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto- bahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word -  a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high); those guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals can crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is that esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very timid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.   You're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) - but the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that in Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding the local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm used to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I consider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...   Sorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a Peugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over here - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.   I disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars weigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at 130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph, it makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on a bicycle: Your're dead.

The most dangerous effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function.  Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas, among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic circulation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis.  These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in men, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplant.  Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in your friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully he or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to you, and offer you support.\",\"Panasonic KX-T3000H, Combo black cordless & speaker phone all in one.  new- $160, now- $100 + shipping OBO.

The above, while literaly true, is a clasic straw-man claim in the context of non-real-time circuits such as E-mail and the like.   I would modestly propose that a mandated use of ISDN would do more for commun- ications than this lot.   Normmaly DES.                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Note the use of the word \\\"business\\\" in the above. The whole tenor of this release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only \\\"business\\\" use is legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's ear to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate. Note that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only reference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized release' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who have legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info. These people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the keys.  The criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens to go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several of them would be a better idea than CLipper!  Them again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded over the last decade ofr so.                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ NSA   Yeah, this bit is VERY true.   Note the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption. A demo of the above claim on an ordanary POTS would be a good nights entertainment I suspect. Note also the 'many'. not 'all', as the general tone implies.                                  ^^^^^^^^^                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  The case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening of the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by the use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law enforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms is blurred yet again.                                   Lets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the word \\\"ensure\\\". As to 'protect', or 'law-abiding', I will leave to you. So to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions, the answer in this press release is, YES.   Just as they only can wiretap now with a warrent.    Just makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved.   Where do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-) And as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have. It will be very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it. After all, it is secure, isn't it. The govt will answer that point by its own actions.                                                  ^^^^^^^^  Again, personal use seems to be a unaskable question.                                                    ^^^^^  Ah, so warrents are not always needed it seems.   The ITARs seem to slightly impeed this.   Note that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret. Only the 'proper people' will be able to express an opinion, hence only the desired result will emerge.   Encryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in equilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have no doubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. Probably fofr practical purposes by the middle of the next century.   It is a little hard to critisise a non-proposal.   Note we drop back to 'phone-mode' again. If this is a true answer, it can be rephrased as \\\" It sucks big time. Anyone who can drive the crypt work-bench will use it for light amusement before breakfast.\\\"   This link between the security of the key-eschrow, and the actual algorithm is  a real winner. Given that I have 2 secret 40 bit numbers, could someone please explain how the details of an encryption algorithm will reveal them?   Just make sure you read the CVs REAL carfully, OK.   Quick, with out looking back, What name is missing from that list?   The people who agree with us and who think there is a buck in it for them.   The reverse engineering provisions of the 'Mask-work' act could be relevent here.   You don't. Not unless you are one of the 'right people'.   They missed the word secret here. He needs a grammar lesson too.   I would say \\\"less secure, less conveniant, more expensive ( PGP is free ), less available, and more prone to being comprimised\\\" Proofs to the contarary will be welcome. Note PROOF.   They don't seem to be saying anything that makes much sense. And this proposal DOES prohibit it except in a very limited way. And, this is the one explicit reference to personal rights. It is a denial. And yes, I don't think that the Mexicans, Brazilians, and Canucks are included in Clinton et als magnanamous gesture.   The 'false tension' is false. The balance is between two repugnant points. The RIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the \\\"false assessment\\\". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps YOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined in the govenment language to be non-existant. If you don't agree, you must be a criminal, as only criminals don't agree with out laws. Also note the non- question. \\\"If what is here was not possible...\\\"   It indicates we know that Bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty < insert suitable retoric > and will stamp out this disorderly, unruley outbreak of freedom and ultra-national sentiment.   This one is a real giggle. In Australia or France, they will have to reveal the keys, and the algorithm.

Q. How do I become an astronaut?      A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably     impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying     passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have     so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to     win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet     experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you     want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \\\"mission     specialist\\\".      If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,     the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly     exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,     but thinning the lineup down to manageable length. It is not enough     to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,     many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.      Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands     dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer     programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-     seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in     another seems to be a frequent winner.      Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight. (DO NOT get a     radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows     what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term     effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other     significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,     you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.      Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in     appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying     to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you     are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you     will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is     a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and     proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.     Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,     and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.     Keep your nose clean.      Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;     experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.      Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,     43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were     a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).     If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job     at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \\\"you     do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\\\".      Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance     to demonstrate motivation.      Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.         NASA     National Aeronautics and Space Administration     Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center     Houston, Texas      Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates     ==================================================================      Astronaut Candidate Program     ---------------------------      The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for     Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates     to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a     continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.      Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be     considered.      All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in     Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation     program.      Space Shuttle Program Description     ---------------------------------      The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated     that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming     routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in     the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then     returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and     flight crew.      The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment     and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation     of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials     processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will     eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space     station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher     orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space     Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include     government agencies and private industries.      The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,     and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are     assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA     astronauts.      Pilot Astronaut      Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.     During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,     crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the     commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the     pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing     the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other     payload operations.      Mission Specialist Astronaut      Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,     have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations     in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and     experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to     have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed     knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and     objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the     experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission     specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling     using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific     experimental operations.      Astronaut Candidate Program     ===========================      Basic Qualification Requirements     --------------------------------      Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to     submitting an application.      Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:      1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,     biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be     followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,     professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable and may be     substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master's     degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). Quality of academic     preparation is important.      2. Ability to pass a NASA class II space physical, which is similar to a     civilian or military class II flight physical and includes the following     specific standards:    Distant visual acuity:        20/150 or better uncorrected,        correctable to 20/20, each eye.    Blood pressure:        140/90 measured in sitting position.      3. Height between 58.5 and 76 inches.      Pilot Astronaut Candidate:      1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,     biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be     followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,     professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of     academic preparation is important.      2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight     test experience highly desirable.      3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a     military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following     specific standards:    Distant visual acuity:        20/50 or better uncorrected        correctable to 20/20, each eye.    Blood pressure:        140/90 measured in sitting position.      4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.      Citizenship Requirements      Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of     the United States.      Note on Academic Requirements      Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic     education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --     specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum     in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's     degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,     biological science, physical science, or mathematics.        The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the     sciences, are not considered qualifying:       - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,  Medical Technology, etc.)       - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological  Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).       - Degrees in Nursing.       - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)       - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.      Application Procedures     ----------------------      Civilian      The application package may be obtained by writing to:   NASA Johnson Space Center  Astronaut Selection Office  ATTN: AHX  Houston, TX 77058      Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA     decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be     given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is     made. Applications received after that date will be retained and     considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually     of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate     continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants     who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from     consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the     preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be     requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as     supervisors and references may be contacted.      Active Duty Military      Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their     respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application     procedures will be disseminated by each service.      Selection     ---------      Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required     for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.     Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered     will be notified of the outcome of the process.      Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the     selection of additional candidates during a one year period following     their establishment.      General Program Requirements      Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be     assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,     Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and     evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or     scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to     ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut     training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills     required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot     astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during     their candidate period.      Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does     not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut     will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and     evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the     training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become     permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for     a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not     selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA     depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that     time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a     specified tour of duty.      NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified     minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.     Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.      Pay and Benefits     ----------------      Civilians      Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal     Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,     and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements     and experience.      Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and     participation in group health and life insurance plans.      Military      Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center     but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and     other similar military matters. \",\"This appeared today in the \",\"Well, I'm amazed at how successful this exercise was. I received 20 responses and 4 requests for summary. Thanks to everyone who made it possible.  On my own I was able to find out about Codebase, Accsys, and Q+E. Codebase and Accsys are C libraries without SQL. Q+E is a Windows application that can be communicated through Windows DDE calls, where you send a SQL string and receive the results.  Most people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Borland. Other  products mentioned were: Microsoft's ODBC, Accsys, Quadbase, Codebase, RBASE, and Q+E. Only ODBC, Quadbase, RBASE, and Q+E have SQL.  For myself, I decided on Codebase, mostly because it has an ANSI C portability version that runs under DOS, UNIX, etc, and includes the source code, and portability is important in my application. It works with DBASE, FoxPro, or Clipper files.  However, I feel that Microsoft's ODBC looks very promising. It's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries, and formatting query results. As the responses say, it's available via ftp, except it's effectively unusuable without two manuals: the \\\"ODBC Programmer's Reference\\\" and the \\\"ODBC SDK Guide\\\". Moreover, ODBC doesn't actually interpret SQL and liase with databases, that's  up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers. Also, it's Windows only (it's actually an extension to the Windows SDK).  Nevertheless, it's a start at a SQL interface standard, and should make life interesting in the future.  Here's my original post, followed by the responses, separated by  a line of asterisks (*).   ****************************************************************************  Borland has a product called Paradox Engine that does just what you want.

With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a  large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand him and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something  like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that \\\"different is good\\\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in  more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a certain \\\"propriatory nature\\\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to  learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.   Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.    I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time.    Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off.   The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always  take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later).     Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).     All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and  shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.   Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.   I think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it's a small one B^)).   I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.    9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the street cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry the \\\"Highway Patrolman\\\".

And much of it is IMHO, but do check Ayoob's book.\",\"   Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power.  When graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft, presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft doesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes 'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope'.   Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans, such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed taxi tests).

Yes (2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000  running at 15.87 Mhz. (3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a  lot of memory. (4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors  that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors  sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell  memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most  memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether  the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine  California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB -  $140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that  are selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here. (5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an  average access time of about 25 ms. (6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a  backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move  your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or  non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.  Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay  for it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to  sell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about  $650.

But I wouldn't miss your adolescent ravings for the world, everyone needs a good laugh now and then. :-) \",\"store and reply of mouse and keyboard events --------------------------------------------  To produce regression tests or automatic demo's we would like to store all mouse and keyboard events produced by a user. It should be possible to filter the mouse and keyboard events from the server's queue an to store them in a file. This sequence of events, stored in a file, should be given  to the server's queue as if a user is working.   1. Exists a tool that is capable to save and reply all    mouse and keyboard events (where)?  2. Where one can catch these events to store them ?    In our case the server's queue is on a X Terminal (HP).    Where can we catch all events coming from a given    server.    If this is not possible, can we catch all events given    to a certain client and how ?     3. Where one can send a stored sequence of events to simulate a user ?    Is there a central dispatcher on the clients machine who manages    all incoming events from a given server and how can we reach it ?   Thanks in advance\",\" They don't move, to anybody much bigger than an electron :-)  noah\",\"  I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues. The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example, was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign. His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound.  Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately.  I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.  I seem to recall CM pitching well initially, though I don't have stats handy.\",\"    They did the rollout already??!?  I am going to have to pay more attention to the news.  Are any of the gifs headed for wuarchive??    Patrick  \",\"   Let me add another of my concerns: Yes, I can buy a port of Motif for \\\"cheap\\\", but I cannot get the source for \\\"cheap\\\", hence I am limited to using whatever X libraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of Motif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have not seen it myself).    Currently, I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which only three came with Motif. On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available.    The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True, I could buy another port of Motif, but that sort of ruins the whole idea of \\\"free\\\", doesn't it?

The Israelites were a direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable. Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to  God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And not just for a few chosen people.

I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm on the Mac side. I have used Procomm, Kermit, and Softerm (on OS/2) on the PC (or PS) side. I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardware ahdshaking cables. And know MY hands are shaking from the effort. Nothing has allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS.  In general, I can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sides are set to speeds OVER 9600 baud. I cannot send files from the Mac to the PS at all, and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible. When I do a straight ascii send, I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly. I can send Binhex files this way quite fast, and I know that the transmission is error free. But straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors. Unless, of course, I do text pacing so slow that it is like human typing. (well, like 2-3 times faster than human typing).  I would like to hear from ANYONE who has been able to transfer files from a Duo 210 to a PS via modem or null modem. If you can do it, please tell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software. Obviously, I am talking of a true serial port modem, not the express modem. Maybe some kind soul with access to a modem and a Duo 210 can check this out for me.  Right now, I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds because of the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speeds because of some crazy reason I don't understand.  Could I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information out the serial port of a Duo 210 fast? Like via a modem or via a sys-ex dump?  Could anyone with a Duo help me out?? I am going absolutely INSANE. I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos, or just me.  Yes, I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times. And not only can I type back and forth, but Zterm alerts the users if s/he uses hardware handshaking and CTS is down. So I know that hardware handshaking is working. And also, According to Zterm port stats, the buffer never overflows.

This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in a powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was told by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return the original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for returning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.  Well, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were ever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me \\\"Why we never received your old chips.\\\"  I then explained I the procedure that I had followed to return them, to which the person replied \\\"You mean you sent them US Mail?\\\" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that I should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly what I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were absolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted to trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to TechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.) Sales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them to \\\"make it right.\\\"  I finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking them to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously appeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with the service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way of knowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengths to prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c'est la vie.

Generally, these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, for example, we have the following set regarding children:   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to   the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum   [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem   families and received as servants when they are left alone through   the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect   all such children in your province and send them to the places of   deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to   the people.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [1]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the   time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their   lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.      Minister of the Interior,       Talaat\\\" [2]   \\\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.    November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the   orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their   places of exile.        Abdullahad Nuri. [3]    \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been   opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is   done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt   of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or   any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it   purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as   detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received   into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish   special orphanages for them.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat.\\\" [4]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.     Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures   to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with   the caravans.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [5]   \\\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.    At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows   of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is   not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by   Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble   in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned   out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of   deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent   away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [6]  In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \\\"rationalizing\\\" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:   \\\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for   its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks   it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I   shall die for it.\\\" [7]   These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these \\\"death march orders\\\" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.  For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.  If one were to examine the sample \\\"authentic text\\\" provided in the Turkish  Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it  too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the  Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or  Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery.   Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide  architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a  heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.  This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian.     - - - references - - -  [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60  [2] ibid, page 60  [3] ibid, page 60  [4] ibid, page 61  [5] ibid, page 61  [6] ibid, page 62  [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and     London), 1926, page 387  \",\" Pardon me?   *I* am trying to apply human terms to non-humans?

I was making the point that, if the same standards are used to validate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history, then virtually nothing is known of the first century.  You seem to be saying that the Bible -cannot- be true because it speaks of the existence of God as it it were a fact. Your objection has nothing to do with history, it is merely another statement of atheism.\",\"  Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by sentence.   1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.  Origins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?  2) Science cannot explain origins.  This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends on what origins we are talking about.  3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science.  Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \\\"higher truth\\\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \\\"higher\\\" or  \\\"lower\\\"; they are simply true.  More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the scope of discussion.  4) This is a false premise.  If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.  5) By the way, I enjoy science.  On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read. However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy, perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.  6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.  Let us not quibble; count this one as true.  7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]  Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification:  \\\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\\\"  -----  It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.\",\"   I had this one time.

While I'll agree that these are generally held to be \\\"good things\\\", I question whether they come very close to being objective values. Especially considering that at one time or another each has been viewed as being undesirable.  I doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally \\\"good\\\" or \\\"bad\\\".  And when I referred to \\\"the truth\\\" I was using the term hypothetically, realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing.   True enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than personal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some \\\"higher authority\\\" (aka, absolute moral truth).   An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth? Interesting notion.   :-)  Certainly one can have as one's morals a belief that compromise is good.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?   Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating production.  The equation is always more complex than presented. To characterize relative morals as merely following one's own conscience / desires is to unduly simplify it. \",\"After I have produced a schematic with PADS-LOGIC, how do I import it into  PADS-PCB to create a PCB pattern?

And Windows 3.1 is also flexible enough at install time that you can copy all the files onto your hard disk, which greatly speeds things up and makes them less annoying, if you can spare the 7 or so compressed megs.   No, we're not.  But we're also not going to promote pandering to corporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience.  I don't *like* dealing with floppies.  Personally, I have no use for changing the registration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to be solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour reinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one way or another.  So, while I'm not going to put much time into it myself, here's the procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:  1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want to install it.  I've been using c:\\\\WINSTALL myself.  2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\\\\WINORIG.  3.  Install from c:\\\\winstall.  4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.       i.e., comp *.* \\\\winorig\\\\*.* >\\\\report.txt  5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming they didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one file should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate said offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hex editor, and do the same for the modified one.  6.  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don't really do cryptography.  It's probably just an xor key or something; I think MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing his copy than with \\\"real pirates\\\" who will probably just disassemble the damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original floppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able to back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a compare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).  As I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and don't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one directory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff I've mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if they'd ever find out.  If you aren't careful with the disk editor, you could also mung something important... duh.  I guess that's a disclaimer.  Have at it....  Rob\",\" [...]   You seem to be saying that a LIMITED government will provide MORE opportunities for private interests to use it to pursue their own agendas, and asking libertarians to prove that this will NOT happen. While I can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area. I rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is more likely to become such a tool, and that it IS such a tool in many instances.   I suspect that this is because \\\"improvement in the human condition\\\" as you define it is not the primary goal of libertarianism, and would not be the primary goal of a libertarian government.

The point is that the land was sold legally, often at prices above its actual value.  It was legal, and good business for the sellers, though it left the Palestinians who worked the land in a poor situation.    I don't know if others share this opinion.  It is mine, and I'm sure there are some who agree and some who don't The way I see it, the fallahin were caught in circumstances  beyond their control, in that since they didn't own the land, they didn't have a say. Of course, now for the sake of the \\\"greater  Arab unity\\\" the Arabs are angry that the land was sold to the Jews (an act that is illegal in Jordan), but when it happened, it was just  business.

Good and evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.  The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's rebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of the Scriptures.  Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words of St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, this is called \\\"theosis,\\\" or \\\"deification.\\\"  One can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul, and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the Creator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God, their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in their lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.  The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil, its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.  Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining of self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?  God must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There is no other way to achieve union with God.  Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities. He was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites, and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God, not in His essence, but in His energies.  The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25.\",\" What about the common joystick found in all computer shops?\",\":Yea, there are millions of cases where yoy *say* that firearms :'deter' criminals.

So what is the actual loop current required for an \\\"off hook\\\"  indication, do you know?\",\"Please Ineed information about desk top publishe- post graduate courses and if possible email address or normal mail. thanks in advance \",\" The interesting notion is that (I watched TV tonight) Koresh never claimed officially to be Jesus Christ.

The  satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section  housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof  mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The  proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation  pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered  around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.       TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The  2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a  single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be  powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).       Further info on TRIAD, DISCOS, etc. can be found in \\\"Spacecraft Design  Innovations in the APL Space Department,\\\" Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest,  Vol. 13, No. 1 (1992).\",\" And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of  better encryption phones, because \\\"the only reason a person would want  one is to evade the police.\\\"  They don't have to track customer lists - they merely have to digitally listen to any phone line and eliminate any that don't have the clipper header/signature.  (No-one has said how it will be modulated - want a bet it's a non-standard and hence easily recognisable baudrate?)  Devices to scan exchanges and detect modems etc already exist.  I've seen them advertised in the trade press.  Once you eliminate crippled crypto devices and ordinary data modems, what's left is crypto worth looking more closely at.  I guess any substitute scheme will have to be v32bis or v.fast to disguise it, though then they just start looking at the data too...  Whatever happens though, the effect of this new chip will be to make private crypto stand out like a sore thumb.\",\"  What evidence are you aware of.

It was  romantic, swashbuckling daredevils,  \\\"those daring young men in their flying machines\\\".  But in reality, it sucked.  Death was a highly likely occurence,  and  the environment blew.  Ever see the early navy pressure suits,  they were modified  diving suits.  You were ready to star in \\\"plan 9 from outer space\\\".   Radios  and Nav AIds were a joke,  and engines ran on castor oil.  They  picked and called aviators \\\"men with iron stomachs\\\",  and it wasn't due to vertigo.  Oddly enough, now we are in the golden age of flight.  I can hop the shuttle to NY for $90 bucks,  now that's golden.  Mercury gemini, and apollo were romantic,  but let's be honest. Peeing in bags,  having plastic bags glued to your butt everytime you needed a bowel movement.  Living for days inside a VW Bug. Romantic,  but not commercial.   The DC-X  points out a most likely new golden age.  An age where  fat cigar smoking business men in loud polyester space suits will fill the skys with strip malls and used space ship lots.  hhhmmmmm,  maybe i'll  retract that golden age bit.

Instead, they should be translated using a predicate letter.  Using \\\"g\\\" to designate God and \\\"j\\\" to designate Jesus, and the predicate letter \\\"E\\\" for the property of being eternal, the first premise is Eg and the conclusion is Ej.     The second premise appears to contain an \\\"is\\\" of identity, in which case it can be properly symbolized as j = g.  But your remark that \\\"Jesus is a subset of God\\\" suggests that strict identity is not desired here. If, however, the first premise means that all members making up the set God have the property of being eternal, the same conclusion follows.\",\"  While I think it is unrealistic to suppose that the federal agencies will fail to promptly comply with a court order, there is  still a good point here.  Local law enforcement will be unable to perform a wiretap without bringing in federal agencies.   Based on the (possibly incomplete) understanding of the system quoted from D. Denning, only the FBI will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer, which seems to be needed even to identify what escrowed keys to request.  This moves a great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level.  The reason I like this point is that it may sway or even persuade people who don't generally line up with the civil liberties crowd.  A national police force is opposed by people from a broad range of political  viewpoints. \",\"As of yet, there has been no description of the general principles behind the Clipper proposal. For example, is this a public key system or a private key system? If the latter, then I don't see how the system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and not the person).  Further, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks. I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks and a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic. I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system, but it does make you think. Of course, this is easily fixable by  giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the  real 80-bit key.\",\"My company has developed an application for the Mac that emulates a chart recorder - virtual pen traces scroll smoothly across the screen.

This led us to investigate Color Quickdraw performance across the Apple line.  The results:  The fastest QuickDraw color performing computer Apple makes is the (drumroll please) LCIII.

Stace \",\"I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly, (motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only \\\"real solution\\\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the \\\"internal nerves\\\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that \\\"force\\\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\",\"I have been looking for a book that specifically addresses the mystery of God in the paradox.

In practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed  with inkjet because smudges etc. can happen.   A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of  that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than  you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the  printer. (I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the  printer)  A sage said to me: \\\"Do you want one copy or lots of copies?\\\", \\\"One\\\",  \\\"Inkjet\\\".    Paper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter  will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that  are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.  HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the  software package has no inkjet driver.   There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a  page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a  laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers  actually use this facility.

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.   The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password   and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full   descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli   [BER91].    decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.    There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,   Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will   decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox   files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you   think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a   call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files   that have a 10 char or less pw key.''  * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?    A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the   plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.   If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the   following:     1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.   (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of   the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.    If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something   over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different   key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes   of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which   indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.    2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This   removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since   English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of   text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing   plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact   one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)    If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a   standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis   texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in   the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.   See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].  * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]    Here's one popular method, using the des command:      cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail    Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called   PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through   1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.   There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this   writing.    There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting   mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own   newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ   as well.    PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm   without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)   in the USA.    RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which   is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside   the USA.    Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of   the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the   message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there   have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and   algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as   we know).  * Is the UNIX crypt command secure?    No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt   breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks   on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].  * How do I use compression with encryption?    A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by   some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).    Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact   distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's   impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse   characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up   more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy   has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some   redundancy in your compressed output.    Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they   have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that   actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of   UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''   that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.      This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a   bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means   removes the need for strong encryption.    Compression after encryption is silly.  * Is there an unbreakable cipher?    Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the   one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as   plaintext.    Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be   useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by   likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is   expected to remain valid.  * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?    Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom   number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be   cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to   predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of   the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of   0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.    A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function   of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently   random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by   the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps   generated by a hardware random number source).    Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,   generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of   entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,   cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo    gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in   it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,   for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random   string.    When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is   important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that   because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \\\"random\\\".  For   example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be   unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a   clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.  * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?    See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount   of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in   the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number   of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this   can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to   back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.    Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have   multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security   from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.    Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic   measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives   probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext   for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible   plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys   are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally   deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine   the likelihood of events of interest.    Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than   D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not   enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of   possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,   which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to   8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but   the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work   required to find the key after approximately D characters have been   intercepted.    In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used   in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key   size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if   it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few   practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all   manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack   some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic   considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a   recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.   Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and   information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most   promising directions.    Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information   statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal   1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the   possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].  * What is key management and why is it important?    One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in   full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,   and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of   course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling   Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)   Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can   eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in   modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are   transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but   also enough key material to cover the traffic.    Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and   handling of keys.    A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology   is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use   employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key   Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that   certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control   personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and   to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the   reporting of lost CIKs.    This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management   problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,   many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''  * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?    Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from   relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a   linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random   number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds   and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a   high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically   this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for   cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more   complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---   but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable   structure at all.    See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].  * What is the correct frequency list for English letters?    There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than   the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:   namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of   English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,   but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.    The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do   you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a   fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It   has changed over time; it is different between different authors.   Any particular message will have different statistics from those of   the language as a whole.    The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have   exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all   reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.   In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other   buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood   estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a   text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with   reasonably robust answers.    So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will   be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.  * What is the Enigma?    ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of   information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by   the British during WWII.''    See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].  * How do I shuffle cards?    Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of   values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output   permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you   need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly   distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that   function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH   is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two   addresses given)    for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;    modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since   ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the   error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s   modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less   than y, go back and get another ranno() value.   * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?    Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with   possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted   separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps   even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.    As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard   PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the   keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be   encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in   part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one   of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.    If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must   be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in   the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.   The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the   illegal copy.   * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?    Utah sells products that break the password scheme of a number of   popular Macintosh and PC software packages.  Their telephone number   is (801) 224-6970    No PD software has been cited but there are many papers on the   subject....

Most atheists are perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesus--but are quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into  misunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications.  They can always make an analogy with the _Iliad_, a book that tells the story of the historical Trojan War, but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations.   I don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of  Christianity through argument.  We have to help foster faith and an understanding of God.  I could be wrong--are there any former atheists here who were led to Christianity by argument?\",\"  The problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about the Bible which they don't actually believe or practice. I've known all sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to the fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the  conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is a (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyone who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition. While I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official position of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).  The particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in terms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact  that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane  and give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this  (other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would  show them that what they claim about the Bible and what they  actually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.  While this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians, I would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this case, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually put into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and look at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying to express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the Christian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as \\\"Word of God\\\", \\\"inerrant\\\", \\\"infallibale\\\", \\\"The Manufacturer's Handbook\\\", \\\"The only rule of faith and practice in the church today\\\" to describe the Bible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at the mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably false and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even when the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical example is from the garden of Eden where God asks \\\"Where are you?\\\" and Adam explains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had answered God's words he would have said something like \\\"I'm here in this tree.\\\" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these words are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of the place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases and explanations that others use.  I hope this helps. --                                                                      ___ Bill Rea                                                            (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---\",\"We have a user that has Word 5.0 and is using symbols such as pi and other mathematic sysmbols, plus doing fractions, etc.  The document shows up on the screen with no problems, looks fine.

For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth, you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer. A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be the payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within the capability of the amateur rocketry community.  It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reduction of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'. Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed here: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year on the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of an orbital eyesore/CCD burner.  I wouldpledge $1000 for the first person to bring it down, and I am sure there are at least 999 other astronomers, nature lovers, or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.  Of course, a  Gerald Bull solution might be simpler. (Either the solution Gerald Bull would apply--the use of a large caliber gun; or the solution which was applied to Gerald Bull--the use of a small caliber gun.)\",\"     Yo--earth to Clayton--*my* philosophy?

Just ascribe to me whatever you want--I know you'll choose wisely. After all, I *do* believe in personal responsibility.    Duh.  What else would you *expect* a socialist to do?     (a) Just when and where have I encouraged people not to be responsible for themselves?  Be specific--but do make up random dates and heinous acts as you see fit.  (b) You and I have encouraged many people to do many things.  How does that in any way make our audiences less responsible for their actions?  Is there a finite amount of responsibility, so (cf. conservation of energy) as I become more responsible for an occurrence by encouraging it the actual perpetrator becomes correspondingly less so?  At what point does the perpetrator become completely innocent altogether?  You know, this lends a whole new meaning to the term \\\"the moral high ground\\\".     I will pass the info on.  Out of curiosity, what kind of jobs would these be?  What's the demographic mix wrt race, age, culture?    Life's a bitch, ain't it?

I do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards.  He does not have too much offensive capabilities, but he is an awesome defensively. Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:) I forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.   As far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who beat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.   I agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that Lankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make a perfect throw?   I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don't forget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/ Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant race when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I will never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading in the right direction.   One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds, but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the East), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they lose.  Maybe this is the year that they will go all the way.

The whole organization (read: EJ and Ley, and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much of a dupe to know how much he was being blind-sided by EJ) dumped on Francis all season, starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract, publicly  humiliating him, stripping him of the \\\"C\\\", and then trading him that Spring to the Penguins. Classy guy, that EJ.  The loss of Francis (and too a lesser extent, Ulf), was one of a series of decimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fan-awareness from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today.  [Gratuitous good EJ note...he did preside over the organization when it acquired Verbeek, Cassels, Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, etc. He stripped the roster but he DID lay a foundation.]\",\"  And yet, Jayne,  as we read the Gospels and in particular the topics that Jesus himself spoke on, Hell figures in a large % of the time -certainly more than heaven itself.  Paul, as we learn in I Thess, taught new believers and new churches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation.  Rev, chapter 20:11-15 is very specific and cannot be allegorized.  I think the word \\\"throne\\\" is used 45 times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the assignment of the severity of judgement, for in John 3 we read that they are already judged.  Rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut.  There is no recourse, excuse or defense.  Yes I agree with you.  Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to extremes before stopping at \\\"moderation.\\\"  I think we have seen the extreme of the \\\"hell fire & brimstone\\\" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme where hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones sensibilities.  I forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a story.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the point of telling him that he didn't believe in Satan or hell.  He believed everybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to pray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man wouldn't do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don't believe in hell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn't exist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn't exist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And yet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.  I'd use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it.  When I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul that isn't called, oi vey!.  What's with that ref that he didn't make that call.  It's unfair.  And just so in life, righteousness demands payment.  As the surgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that which is still of the old creation.  We must preach the Gospel in all its richness which includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life, then broad is the way to distruction.   I think I would fall in there somewhere.  Actually it was both.  After all, repentance isn't only a turning towards, but also a turning away from! No, again, if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we should do it also.  In love, of course, but in truth most assuredly.    I have thought about writing something on this topic, but not now and here.  I would say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its eternality.  1) God is Light.  Yes He is love, but His love has the boundary of Holiness. 2) Dignity of Man.  Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature.    If responsible, then he is also accountable. 3) The awfulness of sin.  Today we have a poor, poor concept of sin & God. 4) Christ.  He was willing to die and go there Himself to offer an avenue to    the \\\"whosoever will.\\\"\",\"The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory, a 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season.  Roster move:  Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill  Injuries:  Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes  Dominic Roussel  Game Summary:  I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts I didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by a few things I did pick up:  First Period:  Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51  Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp) Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda, Har (interference) 18:43  Second Period:  Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00  Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09  Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38 Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski, Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50  Third Period:  Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)  Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11  Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38 Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30  Overtime:  Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15. Penalties - None  Power Play:  Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4  Goalies:  Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)  Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)  On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off.  The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.  The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie.  On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner, Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play.  That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored, much less how.  From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy  Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark. But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????  What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...  #1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey next season.  #2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour, and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.  #3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season. Not a tough choice.  Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.  Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman in years to come.  Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome, he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year.  Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total. But consistency became a problem for him.

If you're interested, you can send him mail at:  att!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK  The FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning percentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in Patrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as many goals as they allowed, 319.  The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.  I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey News that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have no other way of getting them.  I hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have. Knowing the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time almost bearable.

Government of Greece publicly encourages people to destroy and burn schools, religious places, houses, and farms belong to turkish minority. Then, Greek government forces these minorities to go to Turkey without anything with them. You will dream to see Aegean sea as Greek lake but it will never happen. Think about the war between Turkey and Greece in 1915. The river called SAKARYA flood 21 days filled with blood in 1915.    **Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment **directly or indirecly is a \\\"bad\\\" person. **It is not your nationality that makes you bad, it is your support **of the actions of your goverment that make you \\\"bad\\\". **People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you **are. You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and **as a such you must pay the price.   You mean that any person who supports the actions and policies of the government of Greece is a good person. That is your Greek idea to say Turks are bad people. We know who we are and proud to be TURKS anywhere in the world. That is not Greeks business to tell us what kind of people we are. You are not at position to judge people because you are not civilized enough to give equal rights to your own minorities. Millions of minorities are being treated as third class citizen, their rights are taken away from them, and they have no voices under the Government of Greece. They are almost being treated as slaves even though we are getting into 21th century. Therefore, do not make me laught at you.    **You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks.Just **as Greeks, Arats, Slavs, Kurds and all other people who had **the luck to be under Turkish occupation. **They will talk to you about murders,rapes,distruction. **You do not learn about Turks from history books, you learn about **them from people who experienced first hand Turkish friendliness.  The Government of Greece is actively supporting terrorism against Turkey.Armenian and Kurdish terrorists have headquarters in Athens. They are being trained in special camps in Greece. They are taught how to kill innocent women and children.This not a claim, this is a fact known by whole world. In conlusion, you are in action to murder, rape, destroy the innocent people. I do not take you seriously because you are not at any positions to talk about human rights and dignity. Your own government, the Government of Greece actively supports atrocities in Bosnia. Serbs's Barbarism pleases your government. Please Napoleon think twice before you write anything about Turks and Turkey. You are the worst in human right conditions and treatment of the minorities. Who wants to be a fried with someone whose government does not respect the human rights, supports terrorism in Turkey,barbaric actions in Bosnia, treats Turkish minorities as third class citizen and take away all of their rights, treating them as slaves at the beginning of 21th century???????

Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to education, to establish a family and have children, to human dignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are more important to human existence that the rights of states.  2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.  3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an unresolved conflict exists.  4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples and nations.  5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.  6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional political means have failed.  7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the land, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.  8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice. When people love, they share.  Having stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.  1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew and the other Palestinian-Arab.  2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner, although born in areas under current Isreali control, is not entitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.  3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For the second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each subsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.   4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and Christian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of governments and international organizations.  5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on 'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the Middle-East in a graceful manner.  Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will attempt to identify some of these:  1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However, it is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation.  2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the 'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but Israeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be defeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights (see above)  3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their point of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People overrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of human rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar Bronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing assimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its effects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see above)  4.      It may objected that only a few people in Israel/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes.  5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has merits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than $3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government and by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the Middle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a non-segregated society in that worn-torn land.  I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment.\",\" Purists often distinguish between \\\"true\\\" clubbing and \\\"pseudo\\\" clubbing, the difference being that with \\\"true\\\" clubbing the angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly negative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip). With \\\"pseudo\\\" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then negative, which is the normal situation. \\\"Real\\\" internists can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple of minutes.  Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only \\\"true\\\" clubbing is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is very reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the  congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization.   The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally.   Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however, the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.\",\"  They are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust' is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during  the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited,  assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people  because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts  of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes,  set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts  behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly  attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population  indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent  Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with  axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt alive as can be seen below.  Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions  of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and  Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion, also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from  behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of  Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed  widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena was left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from  Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide  by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian,  Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French  journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.  The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum,  Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their  villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred. The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for humanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German, Austrian, French and American authorities.  Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and  cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by  Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish  and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents.  Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of  the victims of these cruelties can be heard.

According to accounts by those who were able to  save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful  events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then  taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people   well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these  places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.  They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the  Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality  problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers  who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and  Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the   Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.   I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is   destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are   speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as   well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is   proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.\\\"                                                       Dr. Stephan Eshnanie  Serdar Argic\",\"  As usually, you are not reading.

In any case, that has nothing to do with the current case.  The claim against the ADL is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that was gathered by state and/or federal agencies in the course of their standard interaction with citizens such as myself.  By that I refer to things such as: address and phone number, vehicle registration and license information, photographs, etc.   You should ask the ADL, if you want an authoritative answer.  My guess is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in political criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as agents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them. At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to Israeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matters will be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.

The bones are said to have been loaded at Mudania on the Sea of Marmora and to be the remains of the victims of massacres in Asia Minor. In view of the rumors circulating it is expected that an inquiry will be instigated.     - - - Reference - - -  [1] _New York Times_, December 23, 1924, page 3, column 2 (bottom)     - - - - - - - - - - - -  On the 78th Commemorative Anniversary of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians, we remember those whose only crime was to be Armenian in the shadow of an  emerging Turkish proto-fascist state. In their names we demand justice.  In April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed  de-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a  genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The  result: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen and plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization on those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish governmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In  the face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies  shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy  merely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state  policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a  crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the  successful genocide of the Armenians.  Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet... Armenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of  Turkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as  \\\"rebels\\\".  Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population figures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.  Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims  Armenians were a \\\"threat\\\".  In a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of  approximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.  Today, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The success of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish population.  The Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and property lost as a result of this genocide.

See the discussion of \\\"high-power rocketry\\\" in the rec.models.rockets frequently-asked-questions list.  This is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy; you need proper certification.  That can be had, mostly through Tripoli (the high- power analog of the NAR), although the NAR is cautiously moving to extend the upper boundaries of what it considers proper too.  You need special FAA authorization, but provided you aren't doing it under one of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that, it's not especially hard to arrange.  As with model rocketry, this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled properly.  Proper handling takes more care, and you need a lot more empty air to fly in, but it's basically just model rocketry scaled up.  As with model rocketry, the high-power people use factory-built engines, which eliminates the major safety hazard of do-it-yourself rocketry.\",\"subscribe comp.graphics quit \",\"Hello, I am looking for commercial software packages for professional fashion designers.  Any recommendation and pointers are greatly appreciated. Please e-mail me, if you may.  Thanks a million.  -- Ge \",\" All very true.  I'm going on what I have read and heard from friends. Basically the Glock is great but I have heard/read that it is a lot harder to learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has.  I was looking at a Glock .40S&W and the S&W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the safties on the guns were very different.  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot more \\\"safe\\\"  (for lack of a better word) than the one on the Glock.  Of course this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  You would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.  Personally I like the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool (guess that's why they use them in so many movies) but I wouldn't get one as my first semi-auto because of the safety.  I would prefer more training with a \\\"traditional\\\" semi-auto (ala Colt .45) but of course that's just my opinion.\",\"  Let's face it, if the words don't get into your noggin in the first place,  there's no hope.

JCAG and SDPA claim responsibility.   Source: Edward K. Boghosian, \\\"Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity Meeting,\\\" The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.  ATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties, including the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both Armenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the  Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.  The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of the Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of ASALA...  Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian people, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal... Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement  was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam  Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued  support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause,  pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be  open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr.  Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that  his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that this policy will continue. \\\"The doors of our camps are always open to  Armenian freedom fighters,\\\" he affirmed.  Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet; two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of the Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations, a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.  More than significant was the large number of messages received by the  organizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary Movement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.                   SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM  Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will continue to \\\"reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,\\\" to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag \\\"Bureau.\\\" The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement, open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.  The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the Greek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence. The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

Differences in the number of pages?  Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..  No need to use the same book size and the same letter   charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!    The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year  first published..   And you tried to hide the whole point..  the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about  how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given   by Serdar Argic exist!!

That is rediculous. The U.S. media is the most pro-israeli media in the world. Having lived in Europe I realize that incidences such as the one described in the letter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to ignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the Europeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think that might be a reason they report more clearly on the atrocities.  What is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of the inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing received from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt go away.

It's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting, since I always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity.  I understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race, religion, ethnic background, sex, or other inconsequential characteristics.  All the evidence I've seen indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics.  Thus, pending further evidence, I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people are bigots, and organizations that exclude such people are discriminatory.\",\"nan\",\"Yes, there is:  consumer confusion.  In the early 80's with the fuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage than comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their 350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big mistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine could not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with these cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer -- DON\\\"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.  Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving, LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper in the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them? Trailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines? No, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a 500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.  I own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine. Just keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline engine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that  when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350 engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about $2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long and gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine costs about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection pump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again, you never need a tune-up.  If you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal. Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.\",\"  Again, from my alcohol server's class: The absolute *most* that eating before drinking can do is slow the absorption down by 15 minutes.

There's more to a real \\\"storage\\\" scope than just a long-persistence phosphor.  Actually, the phosphor ISN'T usually anything special at all; what makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just *behind* the phosphor, which becomes charged as the electron beam intially \\\"writes\\\" the trace. With the trace now written to the screen, a separate low-level \\\"flood\\\" electron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphor which are next to the \\\"written\\\" areas on the storage screen.  There are some problems with this - the resolution is limited compared to a non-storage tube, and the stored trace tends to \\\"bloom\\\" with time.   Of course, this is pretty much obsolete technology, done in by the current digital scopes which use raster-scan displays and keep everything in a frame-buffer memory anyways.            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Ah, yes - from the same people who brought you that amazing new reading program that's sweeping Eastern Europe: \\\"Hooked on Consonants!\\\" :-) \",\"Archive-name: space/intro Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:10 $      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO      INTRODUCTION      This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet groups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth preserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).      If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to your KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).      The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.      Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization.      Questions fall into three basic types:      1) Where do I find some information about space?      Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask     for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There     are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended     discussion.      2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?      Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been     thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for     evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.      3) Miscellanous queries.      These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of     FAQ postings.       SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE      Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.     Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]     Edit \\\"Subject:\\\" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.     Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth  100 posts).     Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST  not SPACE.     Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all  references.)     Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're  responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!     Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail  or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the  'reply' function of mailers will work.     Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone  will get on TV anyway.     Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:  keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals  (use carriage returns).

The war in 1982 was instigated by the Arabs who continually murdered Israeli children with their rocket attacks.  Israel was only trying to stop this.   Last what the heck are you talking about with \\\"1968 (Karama)\\\"?  There was  no war in 1968!       Steve -- \",\"The SDIO has \\\"contracted\\\" with the NRL (Naval Research Laboratory) to fly the Clementine Mission.  BTW we call it DSPSE (Deep Space Project Science Experiment).  The NRL is building the spacecraft, designing the detailed mission and doing the integration and operations (with help from, JPL & Goddard & prob. some folks I have left out...don't be mad).  I am on the TAMP (Trajectory Analysis & Mission Planning) team and am responsable for the IV&V of the traj that Goddard/CSC are designing.  As for why SDIO is doing it, some of the reasons are:     1)  the safety constraints are too tight to try to run the LIDAR in LEO     2)  in LEO we don't get any new radiation data on the sensors, we will get        that data on our 9 passages through the Van Allen (sp?) Belts     3)  since we are going out there...why not piggy-back some general science     4)  the intercept problem is a lot easied over LONG distances and LONG times  I am sure there are some things I have forgotten, and some I haven't been told but, those are the reasons we all talk about.  --  \",\"  Windows Sources Magazine reviewed a number of 17\\\" monitors recently and they too said that the Nanao T560i was the best monitor to get if you had the money. But they also said that the Mitsubishi Diamond Pro 17 is the next best choice and that it has superb picture quality. This monitor can be had for around $1070.  Has anyone actually seen any of these? I am also thinking of buying a 17\\\" monitor and was going to consider the Mitsubishi. If I remember correctly, I think its viewing area is 16\\\" measured diagonally.  Thanks. \",\" First off, let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about \\\"You sick perverts, you are immoral, you are all going to hell.\\\", which seems to be the usual \\\"religious\\\" post found on the alt.sex.* hierarchy.  Hopefully, you won't get flamed, either.  You will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is built on unsteady ground.  First, I do not believe that there is any way to find an \\\"objective morality\\\".  Morality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a person or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even overwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.   Second, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say, you are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by using the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so.    Third, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will always be people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we all are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the religion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring, overbearing totalitarianists?    Hm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to discuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I start off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with you.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of your own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views on homosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the purposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to have their faces uncovered.  The sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind.                                                                              (Evidence deleted)  I'm not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept \\\"The Word of God\\\" that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument for a person who shares your beliefs.  Still, I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could be interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part.   Hmmm...do I detect just a wee bit of condescence here?                                                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     not very objective.    One could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better, or \\\"more good\\\" than non-beautiful people.  I would hope that people relize that this is not necessarily true.                                           ^^^^       Might I suggest the word \\\"penis\\\"? It seems more in line with the tone of your post.              Bravo!  I respect you and your sense of humor, sir.                                                     Yes, and this theme is usually what the better stories are about.  However, they are not always selfish - I could point to examples in the work of Elf Sternberg, for example.   It serves the same purpose as it does in pornographic movies: it affirms the virility of the male involved, as well as assuring the reader that he (the character) has orgasmed.                         Your Whole Picture [TM] unfortunately only applies to people who accept your church.           In addition, if sex is for procreation, then  1) Why did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it, rather than building it in as instinct? 2) Why did God make it fallible?  Not every sexual encounter results in pregnancy, even among Catholics.  Does this mean that they have sinned?     Granted.   Pornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for it.  Many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real life, but will think about and read about and mull over.

I went for a retailer, actually mail order (CDA computers), because its price was better thant the campus computer store. I found out why later on when I tried to get a repair done at an Apple registered repair center - the CPU was a resale. The serial number had been removed and replaced with a non-standard number (probably from CDA computers). Consequently, the Apple repair man could not do ANY warrenty repairs. So I ended up with just a 90day warrenty from CDA over the Apple 12month warrenty. Boy, was I pi**ed! Moral of the story, CAVEAT EMPTOR.  However, if you go with a reliable, trustworthy mail order firm (if they exist - maybe someone could enlighten us with their experiences), you will probably get a better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail order out of state does not REQUIRE sales tax yet. Though for how much longer remains to be seen. The addition in sales tax on a CPU purchase will probably wipe out an educational discount. Again CAVEAT EMPTOR, some mail order companies DO include sales tax on purchases even if they are out of state, so check!\",\"To: Dodge Dart collectors  I have a 1964 Dodge (25th anniversary) Dart 273ci V8 wagon to turn into cash.

First somebody was accusing him of being self-righteous and unconvincing. Now we are told that we Christians should be embarrassed by him. (As well as by Josh McDowell, about whom I have no comment, having never read his work.)  Anyone who thinks that C. S. Lewis was self-righteous ought to read his introduction to The Problem of Pain, which is his theodicy. In it, he explains that he wanted to publish the book anonymously. Why? Although he believed in the argument he was presenting, he did not want to seem to presume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own suffering. He did not want people to think that he was presenting himself as some kind of model of fortitude, or that he was anything other than what he considered himself to be -- \\\"a great coward.\\\"   OFM has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be embarrassed by Lewis' liar/lunatic/lord argument (which, by the way, is part of a *much* bigger discourse.) I would just like to add that, far from being embarrassed by Lewis, I am in a state of continual amazement at the soundness and clarity of the arguments he presents.   - Phil -\",\"     I had a kz440 and thought it was the best $100 bike I've ever     ridden.

The necessity it refers to has always been there, but it's been implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of the new window.   [...]  This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a border-pixel, and the problem should go away.  There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.

The outcome was decidedly mixed.  I won the battle but  lost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was  defective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below  market value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average  retail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but  the decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the  Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the  fact that if you have an automobile that does not  depreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive  to deal with you.  There is no way that the  manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and  sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded  a repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's  representative at the hearing tends to support this  point of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not  seem to take the proceeding very seriously.  I decided to take the repurchase, even though I am  getting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have  to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon  myself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on  the Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to  my elected representatives telling them how utterly  ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for  a \\\"use deduction\\\" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.   As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying  for my insurance.  Summary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton HD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992  this vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems  that required attention included the transmission,  heater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main  problem was the five speed manual transmission.  They  could not install a non-defective transmission in at  least four attempts.  So, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but  you are going to get screwed on the price, unless you  paid too much in the first place, or if your car  happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.\",\"  > I wonder if Ojeda will sue anyone - because his career may be over.

What else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial number?    To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is    first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.    S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a    64-bit block R1:      R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .     Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and    N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]      R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .     R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The    first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The    rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2    are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow    agencies. \",\"  I don't know a whole lot on Proton, but given that it is a multi stage rocket,  up to 4 stages, it may not really need the Centaur,  plus it may end up seriously beating on said centaur.

The moderator replies:  That is generally accuate, but contains one serious error.  We Catholics do believe that God's revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in the Bible can be and is passed on through the Tradition of the Church. It should be noted that the Tradition of the Church, otherwise known as Sacred Tradition, is not the same as ordinary human traditions. However, we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to the Church.  Public revelation, which is the basis of Catholic doctrine, ended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  Nothing new can be added.  Theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications that were not recognized previously, so that the Council of Nicea could define statements about the theology of the Trinity and the Incarnation that were not explicitly stated in the Bible and had been disputed before the council, but there was no new revelation at Nicea or at any subsequent council.  Cardinal Newman's _An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine_, written while he was still an Anglican, is an excellent discussion of of this point.

Today I was turning a 90 degree corner just like on any other day, but there was a slight difference-  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very tangible \\\"thunk\\\".  I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage.  My bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the lower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a \\\"bank-follower\\\", or a little stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a 100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7 mm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the mystery.  The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'm fairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.    Okay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?  How can you rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without damaging the thread in the hole ?  Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo that Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly changes phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid ?

Is this correct?? If so, why the big time delay?? I know all scripture is inspired of God, so the time of writing is I suppose un-important, but I still can't help be curious!  --------------------------------------------------- Ivan Thomas Barr   Contact me at u9126619@athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk  [The Gospels aren't dated, so we can only guess.  Luke's prolog is about the only thing we have from the author describing his process. The prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to do some investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally that say a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There are debates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly don't have the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of them seriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, and was written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die. One tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words may have been made earlier than the current Gospels.    In the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbal transmission of information.  I think many people would have preferred to hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe even from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather than from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a period when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do think there was some written material earlier, which was probably used as sources for the existing Gospels.  Establishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to confess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods used.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64 AD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the Century.  A few people vary this by a decade or so one way or the other.\",\"    Well, pardon me for trying to continue the discussion rather than just tugging my forelock in dismay at having not considered actually trying to recover the energy from this process (which is at least trying to go the 'right' way on the energy curve).  Now, where *did* I put those sackcloth and ashes?  [I was not and am not 'pretending' anything; I am *so* pleased you are not surprised, though.]   Note that I didn't say it was perpetual motion, or even that it sounded like perpetual motion; the phrase was \\\"sounds almost like perpetual motion\\\", which I, at least, consider a somewhat different propposition than the one you elect to criticize.  Perhaps I should beg your pardon for being *too* precise in my use of language?   I will believe that this process comes even close to approaching technological and economic feasibility (given the mixed nature of the trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of separating things first and having a different 'run' for each actinide) when I see them dump a few tons in one end and pull (relatively) clean material out the other.  Once the costs, technological risks, etc., are taken into account I still class this one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun.  Sure, it's possible and the physics are well understood, but is it really a reasonable approach?   And I still wonder at what sort of 'burning' rate you could get with something like this, as opposed to what kind of energy you would really recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power with and without the energy recovery.

It sounds like you're suggesting  Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella.      Which reports are those?      I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter. Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem.       I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners. Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.     As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak  defensively if Blauser plays.

JPEG (pronounced \\\"jay-peg\\\") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of \\\"natural\\\", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is \\\"lossy\\\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of \\\"realistic\\\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File    Size in bytes  Comments  ship.ppm 1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits     or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z  963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress     compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.     Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif  240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif     Most of the savings is the result of losing color     info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95  155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)     This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,     at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75   58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)     You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this     from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50   38406  cjpeg -Q 50     This has slight defects; if you know what to look     for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing     the original.  Still as good image quality as many     recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25   25192  cjpeg -Q 25     JPEG's characteristic \\\"blockiness\\\" becomes apparent     at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).     Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were     of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o    6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)     Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or     indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:     the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good \\\"quality\\\" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  \\\"Quality 95\\\" does NOT mean \\\"keep 95% of the information\\\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \\\"op art\\\".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just \\\"high\\\"/\\\"medium\\\"/\\\"low\\\"-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \\\"How to find sources\\\". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with \\\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\\\" in the body.  The \\\"Anonymous FTP List FAQ\\\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for \\\"canned\\\" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the version number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on export or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits internally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to convert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first. But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG. CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check the \\\"save at normal size\\\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) \\\"msdos/graphics\\\" at Simtel20, that really means \\\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\\\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) \\\"/pub/msdos/graphics\\\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip     Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip     PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \\\"AugJPEG\\\", \\\"NewAmyJPEG\\\", \\\"VJPEG\\\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris, but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The \\\"official\\\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article \\\"How to find sources\\\", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \\\"JFIF\\\" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called \\\"color quantization\\\".  (This is something of a misnomer, \\\"color selection\\\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \\\"smeared\\\" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as \\\"256-color JPEG\\\".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit \\\"hi-color\\\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying \\\"-Q 100\\\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say \\\"-sample 1x1\\\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to \\\"do their own thing\\\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \\\"low-end\\\" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a \\\"high-end\\\" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \\\"lowest common denominator\\\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     \\\"raw JPEG\\\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is   \\\"begin\\\" line  M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with   \\\"begin\\\" line  M:'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different \\\"back end\\\" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The \\\"fair use\\\" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (\\\"ghost\\\" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \\\"dithered\\\" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to \\\"smooth\\\" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try \\\"-smooth 10\\\" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that \\\"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\\\" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net. \",\"seningen@maserati.ross.com (Mike Seningen)    The funny thing about the digital dash (87 T-bird) with the 85mph speedo  limit was that if you pressed the button to convert to kilometers it would  read all the way up to 187kph.

I thought, hey I can rin a PSPICE simulation using 741 opamp  models. Yea, great! It worked. But, I guess the 741 wasn't made for High power amps. As a result, I got a Voltage gain of ~15mV/V. Worse than I started with 8(... Does anyone have a PSPICE CKT file with cheap yet good gain? How about some models for some of the chips listed in this  E-mail? Any ASCII Chip info you guys can send me?   I'm open to Suggestions/Ideas/Comments/Help! Please E-mail since I have little time to search the News...  And I'll post if there's and interest!

However greatly we extoll Mary, it is quite obvious that she is in no way God or even part of God or equal to God.  The Assumption of our Blessed Mother, meant that because of her close identification with the redemptive work of Christ, she was Assumed (note that she did not ASCEND) body and soul into Heaven, and is thus one of the few, along with Elijah, Enoch, Moses (maybe????) who are already perfected in Heaven.  Obviously, the Virgin Mary is far superior in glorification to any of the previously mentioned personages.  Jung should stick to Psychology rather than getting into Theology.\",\" When Apple came with their demos to Iowa State, I got a chance to run Speedometer3.1 on some of the new Macs.  Both machines were running System7.1, had a 14\\\" RGB.  Don't know what the caches were set to. Neither machine had an FPU  It appears that the Centris610 is quite a bit faster than the LC III:    Centris610  LCIII  CPU  13.01   6.92 Graf  15.67   7.69 Disk  2.22   2.44 Math  25.57   10.19  P.R. Rating 12.91   6.58  So, there is a comparison.  There is definitely a very noticable speed difference between these two machines according to Speedometer3.1.  \",\"I heard the diesels are considered cleaner-burning than gas engines because the emit less of: Carbon Monoxide, Hydrocarbons, and Oxides of Nitrogen.  (CO, HC, NOX).  But they can put out a lot of particulate matter.  I heard something about legislation being discussed to \\\"clean up diesel emissions\\\".  Is there anything in the works to install \\\"scrubbers\\\" for diesels?  How about the feasibility of installing them on trucks and cars?  Would it be any different than a catylitic converter?  I'd assume easier, since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting gasses.

It seems to me the time and money involved in travelling out there (unless this person is close to you) wouldn't be worth it for a small claim. It really depends on how much money you're out.

When I eat foods with MSG I get very thirsty and my hands swell and get a terrible itchy rash. I first experienced this problem when I worked close to Chinatown and ate Chinese food almost everyday for lunch.  Now I can't tolerate MSG at all.  I can notice immediately when I have eaten any.  I try to avoid MSG completely.  Interesting fact though is that all three of my children started experiencing the exact same rash on their hands.  I couldn't understand why because I don't MSG in cooking and we ask for no MSG when we do eat Chinese (I still love it).  After some investigation I knew that Oodles of Noodles where one of their favorite foods.  One of the main ingredients in the flavor packets is MSG.  Now I look at all labels.  You would be surprised at places you find MSG. \",\": The driver had looked over at me casually a couple of times; I : know he knew I was there.  oh, okay.  then in that case it was attemped vehicular

ESPN had prior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had contracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal was very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this one-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the season started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by squeezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota game) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball telecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last night).  But the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.  They must honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have something to do with it, especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach of contract with baseball.  So relax.  I'm happy.

The reason the neutral and ground are tied together in the panel is the tranformer on the power pole has a grounded center-tap secondary, with the grounded center-tap the neutral.  This gives 120v to neutral(ground) from each side of the transformer and 240v across the transformer.

Yes, I think he should have done more to get out of the way.  As much as fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning the game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware that this is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch it himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.  I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against  visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the field.  Now, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or not.  Sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize his first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win. \",\" If no-one looks at the results, or acknowledges their correctness, in what meaningful sense can the chip be said to \\\"work\\\"??

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?\",\"Word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centred character to indicate spaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw.  Our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character  displayed is a large hollow box.  They overlap each other and characters on each side, which is useless.  I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183). This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corel font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183 character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W. Altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font graphics displayed however!!  Is the W4W character used to indicate spaces the period-centred character?

The simple fact is that there is not a Christian on the face of the planet (that I know of!) that is perfect.  I have been known at times to have a fit of temper, or a sulk, but this does not make me any the less a Christian.  One of the points of being a Christian (as I perceive it) is to become MORE LIKE Christ.  This statement inherently suggests that we ARE NOT already like Christ.  Jesus never unrighteously lost his temper.  I do.  Jesus was perfect.  I'm not.   You must understand that this is because Christians often forget to treat others as our role-model - Christ - would.  This is because we are human and falible.  I, for one, do not pretend to be infalible, and I hope that my fellow-men will bear with me when I make mistakes.  This surely is not too much to ask, when I make every effort to bear with _them_.    And don't we know it!   Again I say, we are ALL human!  To my brethren, this:    Ms Duticci has a valid point and we as Christians ought to heed the warning in her article.  We oftimes discredit ourselves and our Saviour, in the way that we treat others.  Strive towards the goal set us by our Lord, but in the meantime, remember :       \\\"There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ...\\\"  When you blow it - go easy on yourself.  Forgive yourself, as your Father in heaven forgives you!  And remember - and this is something I firmly beieve and cling to - one day, we shall see Him face to face, and in that day, we shall (finally!) be perfected.    I look forward to seeing you there.

I've got a problem that  I need as many people's help from as possible.  Before I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell you that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy meets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...  OK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family and I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the street, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me... her name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have been writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about 2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago.   By the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.  OK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming back to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I drove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent the whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though we had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being in person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met. (She's one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could ask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to  mention WAY out of my league...although I'm  not unattractive mind you), but she had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the extent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she knows I am a Christian.   Well, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such a thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid you not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.  In out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding dates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her). She has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended up leaving school....Now we are at the present...  Let me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....   \\\"Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm not going to KU anymore because something just isn't right. College just wasn't clicking with me here. Greek life is really big here and that just isn't my way. I wasn't taking any classes that truly interested me & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. I was interested in something medical (Physical Therpy) & I love working with  kids, but 'it' just didn't work for me at this university. And my parents could tell.  \\\"So I'm working full time at the Bass Store [Bass shoes that is] and now I have a part-time job at a local daycare. I work in the infant room M-W-F. I've really enjoyed it so far. It spices up my week a little bit and  it's great experience.  \\\"As of now, I'm not planning on going back to school in the very near future. The main reason being my indecision on what I want to study. But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple of years. Where? I have no idea--except for one thing, it won't be to Kansas.  \\\"Right noew I'm discussing a promotion with my boss and district  manager. It looks like I'll train at the store I work at now for about 4-6 months as Assistant Manager and when that's done, I'll  basically be given a list of stores (newly or soon to be built) to  chose where i would like to manage. I've pretty much decided on either one of the Carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) Wouldn't it be fun to actually see each other more than once every few years?? What do you think abou that? I would like to know your opinion.  \\\"This job would pretty much be temporary. But it is VERY GOOD pay and any thye of management experience would look good on an application or resume. The company is solid and treats it employees very well. Good benefits, bonuses & medical plans. Plus- after 1 year of full-time service, they will reimburse tuition. I do have school money waitng for me, but this will help, especially since I will probably end up  paying out of state tuition wherever I go.  \\\"Chris, i really would like to know what you think of my decision. I  respect your opinion. I've been completely lost for what to do for  soooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really  good. I do like my job although I'm about 99.9% sure that i want to do more with my life than reatil management..but it IS something. I don't think earning about $20,000 a year for a 20 year old female is too bad.   \\\"Anyway, onto your career decisions.

What do you think she meant about the marraige thing??   I dream at night about marrying her, and then she mentions it in her letter!!! I don't know what to think??  Since she wants to move to the Carolina's should i search out a  Bass store near here and aske her to come to Carolina???  I always pick on those people who graduate from high school and get married....but what does she mean???   I've had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that  I don't date beacause 1) No time  2) Not that much $$ 3) that most college women are wrapped up in the social scene with  the Greeks whic as a Christian I can't support-----and here she says she doesn't like the Greek thing either!!  Maybe I'm so stunned because there is actually a girl that I am so attracted to paying some real attention to me.  I mean, what if she did move to NC...what would I do??? I'm only 19 and she 20....I'm only a Sophmore struggling through classes..  I have prayed about this over the past year from time to time.. saying, \\\"God if she is the right one, let the situation open up..\\\"  Could this be my sign???  I would do ANYTHING to get her to NC...here is some moree that makes  it worse..  Should I call her?? I'm terrible over the phone. I don't even like to talk to my friends here for longer than 3 minutes.  I mean, what would a girl as perfect as her want with a very average guy like me??

Whether this is your problem or not I don't know. I have had sporadic SCSI problems with my IIfx since I bought it. (I cannot connect more than three devices, fourth one causes major problems).  First thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system. If you continue to get errors it is probably the drive. If it formats fine then I would try to format it on your system with no externals. If this  fails then the SCSI controller on your IIfx needs repair/replacement.  Hope this helps.  \",\"I want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around 5 megabytes / sec for very large data transfers.  (Around 5 MB.)  I have a Quadra 950.  I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.          (using block-mode transfers) I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can          achieve 6.8 MB/s.  Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.  It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer, then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)  So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer,   Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer. Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer. Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.         ... Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer. Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.  Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously, and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho') each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.  Why?  Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time.) Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use the same bus to mac RAM?

Worshipping Lenin that will make life pleasant for the working people is, eh, somehow similar, or what.

A capacitor kludged in somehow, etc?  I've got a microcontroller that is running a bunch of valves and pumps in a big instrument washer, and almost everything is being switched with zero-crossing solid state relays, so that stuff stays \\\"quiet\\\", AC-wise. But there's one steam valve that gets turned on by a mechanical relay in the water tank fill/thermostat system, and it's not under control of my SSRs, and it does sometimes generate/radiate a spike that resets one of my peripheral chips.  My software times out and tries again, but I'd love to just tack in a magic spike-killing fix that would avoid having to do some major rewiring/redesign.  A varistor would help but might not be sufficient.

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier. The Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.

But, are you using Paul to correct the words of Jesus?   \\\"So *anyone* who dissolves even one of the smallest commands and teaches others the same way, will be known as the lowest in the kingdom of the skies; whereas *anyone* who keeps the commands and teaches them too, will be known as *someone* great in the kingdom of the skies.\\\" Mat5:19 (Gaus)  Are you an \\\"anyone\\\" or are you a \\\"no one?\\\"  Why not assume, that since Jesus didn't say that his words apply only to Jews, that they apply to all human beings, irregardless of race or sex?  Why not assume, that even though Jesus did not mention your name, still Jesus was talking directly to you?   Does it say that it applies to *you*? Are you anyone or no one?   Ex20:8-11(JPS) Remember the sabbath day and keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; you shall not do any work - you, your son or daughter, your male or female slave, or your cattle, or the stranger who is within your settlements. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth and sea, and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and hollowed it.  Note: There is no specific requirement for worship here, however I for one would not be so bold as to call these verses a \\\"ceremonial detail.\\\"   Don't many Christians still practice circumcision?   It's unfortunate that Jesus didn't use your name directly, or maybe Jesus did? Are you somebody or nobody?   If you don't see a problem, then perhaps there is none. As Paul closes Romans 14 (Gaus):    In short, pursue the ends of peace and of building each other up. Don't let dietary considerations undo the work of God. Everything may be clean, but it's evil for the person who eats it in an offensive spirit. Better not to eat the meat or drink the wine or whatever else your brother is offended by. As for the faith that you have, keep that between yourself and God. The person is in luck who doesn't condemn himself for what he samples. On the other hand, the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty, because he isn't acting on his faith, and any failure to act on faith is a sin.\",\"I have a question regarding sending a NULL character across ethernet connection.

Thanks\",\" No.  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost, and Ron Hextall is the reason Quebec won.  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that goaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're Montreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it; he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides, Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.  Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more).  Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than  five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME  ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear  the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to  play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.  Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this article, if possible.   I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who) in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in regardless.   Yep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second, IMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.  Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their zone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red  Army.    But I still hate the team.  On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a powerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit.  Same goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is waving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  New Jersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario is unbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.  But I  hate that team anyway.  \",\"  And not only that, made a second clone from the same tissue sample after that of said domineering wife, to run at the helm of the more-pro-business party under guise of more free trade ... and she did inhale, many times, to boot ...

Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it (as long as my advisor doesn't catch me - which is easy enough to do), but  stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review  committees and the peer review process in general.  In today's world that's  what determines what science is: what gets funded.  And a damn good thing to. Flights of fantasy just don't have much chance of producing anything, at  least not in biomedical research.  The surest way for a graduate student to ruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with  fleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a project that actually has a good chance of producing some results.  MD's seem to  be particularly prone to this aberrant behavior.     I have to agree with Gary Merrill's response to this.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2) swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.  2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked to the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity from April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay Antenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to 11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.  3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment data; long term trend analysis is continuing.  6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation index is near the optimal level.  7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument. Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed during the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.  9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 260 hours   GDS (Ground Data Systems):  1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21 (Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller (TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The 10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was not metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.

Thanks a lot in advance!  --\",\"I'm a biker and a dog-lover.  First and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first.  Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent.  Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible. But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!  Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a game, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one; when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of.  With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures may be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important -- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The larger the dog, the greater your anger.  Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.  Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped punishment.\",\"I was wondering if anyone had any kind of Fenway Park gif.

It is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the \\\"normal\\\" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in absence of this, laterality can be \\\"random.\\\" People with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong side).

Perhaps the biggest \\\"imperfection\\\" of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains.  Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes.   On the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted later, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused, if introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated, since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are conserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and these are not found in or near intron sequences.   I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting \\\"theological arguments\\\" like this.  Try Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish & Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.  : Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does : God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a : theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely : scientific perspective, just different.  Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas  theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.   : I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect, : but that doesn't mean it's perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.  For the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support your assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective, unless you support it by some evidence.  In fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we've thought - for instance, sex might have evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by computer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.)    : Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma : rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.  In fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action.   : Actually, neither of us \\\"knows\\\" what the atmosphere was like at the : time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most : biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after : all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth : was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I : seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for : the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?  I'd replace \\\"created\\\" with \\\"formed\\\", since there is no need to  invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one. Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8 billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years. This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve.  I'm sorry I can't give any references, this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry I attended here.   : >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer : >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of : >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the : >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.    Again, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for this supposed \\\"degeneration\\\"?   I can understand Scott's reaction:  : > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be : > jesting.  Do you know what pathogens are?  Do you know what  : > Point Mutations are?  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME : > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!   :  : In response to your last statement, no, and neither do you. : You may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you : cannot *know* that.  I hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests  everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against this conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in  anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the  right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so, and not to present one's own conclusions prior to this.   Theology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions.  : >>Human DNA, being more \\\"complex\\\", tends to accumulate errors adversely : >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the  : >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  : >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence : >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial : >>diseases/disorders.  You are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators from degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to  survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it  to the present.   And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection, and thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either claim.   : But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in : answering John's question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases, : and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require : babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God's fault? (the original : question) -- I say no, it is not.  Of course, nothing \\\"evil\\\" is god's fault.  But your explanation does not work, it fails miserably.   : You may be right.  But the fact is that you don't know that : Satan is not responsible, and neither do I. :  : Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it : be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills : that affect mankind?  I don't think so.  He could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is, it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution.  : Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference. : Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the : point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I : never said that people are \\\"meant\\\" (presumably by God) \\\"to be : punished by getting diseases\\\".  Why I did say is that free moral : choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject : God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not : expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic : universe.  I am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone. I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.  What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?    : Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).  But I'm working on it.  :)  A good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.  : What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the : question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are : fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain : *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don't explain : the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.  Why is there a \\\"why behind\\\"? And your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend these books.  Is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence for this? If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al) suggest, why do people still insist on this?   : Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am : not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details : of biology and genetics, although I'm sure I'd find it a : fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do : not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the : beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its : environment.  I'm sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture, and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation. It can come into existence without a Supreme Being.  Try reading P.W.

My observations over the past 30 years (and not withstanding a little history reading beside) is that while religious differences do play a part in many of the conflicts, so does (unfortunately) race, economics and any other items that identify one group of men as being different from another.  If we want to couch the cause of conflict in Christian terms, I would put it while Christ died for our sins, we are yet sinners. While some individuals assume \\\"Christlike\\\" natures, most of us do not even come close.  I realize that in many ways this is a trite answer, but I guess that it is my way of rationalizing man's constant (or so it seems) conflict.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------\",\" Splitfires work mainly by providing a more-or-less unshrouded spark to the combustion chamber.

Manuals still shrinkwrapped, and all  registration materials present.  Asking $125.  \",\" A number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens, and tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For citizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves on a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places, is for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place in banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc... Quite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card for such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public. Furthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information.  The only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might be taken into account is during interaction with the police, based upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are clearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field is being used to discriminate against them officially.    I take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries do know that they have nothing to fear from \\\"Israeli expansionism\\\". Militarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of land under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a sustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing the Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the Awali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal strip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire. Public opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada via territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from battle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it.  With regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree with the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating a starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal and a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders, the negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state smaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller borders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic and sensible.   Your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a \\\"center for policy research\\\".  Whether or not all of Vanunu's revelations were true has no bearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing \\\"state secrets\\\" after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that said secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished. As to which were and which weren't, I am under no moral obligation to disclose that - quite the reverse in fact. He was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue with a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the concept of \\\"Secrets of state\\\", something which every democratic govt has.   I noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist more than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted, which you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such reports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill, as tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not made public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know about it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours. This would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.   Well, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such questions are often termed \\\"tabloid journalism\\\" and are not disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity. Such questions were often used during the McCarthy era as a basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use your own example, these questions might have been lifted from the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray as a larger and dirtier picture.  My answers were not any more \\\"hysterical\\\" than the questions themselves.  The problem is not that the q's were provocative, it was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You fall into the same category of those who seek \\\"yes\\\" \\\"no\\\" answers when the real answer is \\\"of sorts\\\".

I was raised as a Unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an agnostic, but recently I have developed the firm conviction that the Christian message is correct and I have accepted Jesus into my life. I am happy, but I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and quite possibly about what Christians should hold as true. This I am trying to rectify (by reading the Bible of course), but it would be helpful to also read a good interpretation/commentary on the Bible or other relevant aspects of the Christian faith.

Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows   (with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge   machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into   the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into   the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I   was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother   board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from   SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized   fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.  The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes   rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves   the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't.   I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said   these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire   day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's   in the sppace of 20 minutes?  What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good   diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software   problem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After   Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or   gdi.exe.

Can anyone provide any info? Thanks in advance, --Peter\",\" Dear Defiant (or Unfaithful or Pixie):  I will take up the challenge to reply, as I am a theist.  The foundation for faith in God is reason, without which the existence of God could not be proven.  That His existence can be proven by reason is indisputable (cf. my short treatise, \\\"Traditional Proofs for the  Existence of God,\\\" and Summa Theologica).  Now, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason, I assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?  Because God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter, the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the Measure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order to the universe (logos).  I next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is contrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And, since God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior as early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that because a human (Adam) was first responsible for man's alienation from the Source of all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship. Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.  Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim is true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.  You next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United States Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned, and thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For example, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, he could have denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true.   Therefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.  QED   --  boundary\",\"I bought my HP48sx calculator a month ago, used once but put it back in the box.

Wouldn't it just make more sense to find some way to cut down on the cost of malpractice insurance?  And maybe that's not such a good thing. I also read somewhere that it is next to impossible in Canada to litigate against the health system-class action suits are nearly impossible, and you can't sue the provincial health officials at all.   Oh no. Don't let the AMA know about this. They have enough power as it is. Ask most Americans whether they'd like the doctors' lobby to get more powerful.   Well, yeah, tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre outside Ottawa. Theoretically it's limited to service personnel, but some studies I've heard about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not only have connections but aren't \\\"urgent\\\" at all.  The problem is, in a system where hospitals' annual budgets are approved by the government, how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions? I bet that if you're an MP or MPP, or good friends with one, you're put on any hospital's \\\"urgent\\\" care list no matter how minor your problem. Which is OK  unless you're someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot.   Hmm. How much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of GNP spent on health care if dentistry and optometry were included in the accounting?  Maybe Canada spends proportionately just as much on health care as we do.   So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse. Bob Rae, the second least popular man in Ontario, warned Ontarians a few years ago that if they didn't stop cross-border shopping in such huge numbers, \\\"the services they expect from the province just won't be there in a few years\\\" (Fortunately for them (and less fortunately for the retailers here in Western New York) the  Canadian dollar went back to a more realistic value). He didn't say so, but I knew he meant the OHIP. What would happen if his warning turned out to be the  truth? Would the private insurers take up the slack? They'd be under no  obligation to. Of course, they could eventually make money again, but if what you say is true, they'd be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling  such basic services, too).   Would that it were free. Americans would start another revolution if they had to pay taxes at Canadian rates. \",\"   That brings up an interesting point. Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked  at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they were 24, and noticed some interesting things.     For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also   found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc.     It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory.     I guess Ray Knight makes his rebuttal tonight.   \",\" I do recall Watt making a comment to this effect, though it was quite a few years back and I can't cite the specifics.  I also recall that Cecil Andrus, who was Secretary of the Interior during the Carter Administration, responded to Watt's comments by pointing out the stewardship role that God gave to man, as recorded in Genesis.  Which makes me wonder: who are the true conservatives?  It seems to me that a *conservative* should want to *conserve* things of value for long-term societal benefit.  This form of *conservation* should logically extend to the physical environment in  which people live, as well as the moral environment in which they relate to one another and to God.  IMHO, Watt's stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served  on the board of directors for Jim Bakker's organization, during a time in  which Bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed Bakker  in federal prison.\",\"     Not necessarily.  I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme is to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange, either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme like Diffie-Hellman.  If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone company or some other online central authority generates a session key and sends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of having some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for a copy of the session key for each call.      Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of every public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably, there will be some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally- signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit, stored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to everyone's public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to the security of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you don't use your designated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips.      It might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you to use either the original public/private key pair, or some other key pair and verification scheme.  Unfortunately, this would not allow you to call most people and establish secure communications....\",\"      Ncd has an excellent document titled \\\"Host Loading Considerations in the X    environment\\\".

(Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.) Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:  1) They don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is  still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the  load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground  return), so you still get ground and power line bounce.   2) They do help a lot with on-chip loads, as I had with the high load  on the clock lines.   3) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high  frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff  capacitors, since the RC time constant is too large.  What I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich,  but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent  diff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly  lines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probably  omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,  using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high  resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).  4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with  slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for  output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.  I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for  a MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I  needed.

One approach is simply to try and move political opinion and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Another approach is to try and amend the constitution.  The original constitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention for 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it. The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains government (particularly state and local), even though on many particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I think libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via an amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).  Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this as a problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That might be true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  If a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then falls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This is unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now, but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of, if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.\",\"------------------------------ Wrong, if a bunch of faggots from the tenderloin decide to go straight bashing and they selectively target a heterosexual man and beat the bloody fuck out of him, they would get charged as well under all the federal laws that exist about violation of civils rights.

The national government retains the right to make any laws necessary to sufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone's civil rights until that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it!

What strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of Lucifer's fall - which, by the way, I seem to recall to be more speculation than based on biblical text, but my ex RCism may be showing - is that, as Benedikt pointed out, Lucifer had perfect nature, yet he had the free will to \\\"choose\\\" evil.  But where did that choice come from?  We know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a tempter which many assume was Satan, but how did Lucifer discover, invent, create, call the action what you will, something that God had not given origin to?  Also, where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer's free will? We make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes me as being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, like salvation, not one that all Christians believe in identically.

The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is a one-way hash function? * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.? * What are MD4 and MD5? * What is Snefru?   * What is a one-way hash function?    A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and   produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally   impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't   determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not   even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also   computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the   same hash.    A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an   encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash   function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are   relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user   is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,   and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the   signature can do the same thing.    Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.  * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?    There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a   very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which   isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it   a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption   functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have   hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1   if and only if X = H(M).    A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private   decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the   previous question, have public hashing and public verification.   Digital signature functions have private hashing and public   verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,   but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.    Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to   be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real   difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key   isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend   rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing   ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.  * What are MD4 and MD5?    MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.   Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is   available from [FTPMD].    Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft   RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a, though some   people refer to it as MD5.  * What is Snefru?\",\" I knew that Cutie would sell us out.

(818) 354-5011  Contact:  Mary A. Hardin  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993 #1506       Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to measure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.       The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airport reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took measurements as part of a program established to correlate data with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).         The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle Discovery.       \\\"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important ways,\\\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on the balloon research campaign.         \\\"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\\\" he continued.  \\\"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists, and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own right.\\\"       The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring.  Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps scientists construct more accurate computer models which are instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.       The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere; a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the atmosphere absorbs sunlight.        Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three- hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130 kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m. Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded to separate from the balloon.       \\\"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurements,\\\" Margitan explained, \\\"and we also needed to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\\\"       It will be several weeks before scientists will have the completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS scientists.           The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon Facility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a contract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.       The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.       The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements Program.                        \",\"[The following is my comment on an article by Desiree Bradley.  --clh]   Koresh did originally claim to be the Christ, but then backed off and said he was a prophet.

The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the Holocaust is a myth, archivists say.  \\\"The notes give them their authenticity,\\\" said Robert Wolfe, a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  \\\"He was supposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his own rules.\\\"  The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.  Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than 100 German secret police generals.  \\\"I also want to talk to you, quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly. I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish race.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been written and is never to be written.\\\"  [Emphasis mine--rje]  The German word Himmler uses that is translated as \\\"extermination\\\" is *Ausrottung*.  Wolfe said a more precise translation would be \\\"extirpation\\\" or \\\"tearing up by the roots.\\\"  In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism, \\\"Judenevakuierung\\\" or \\\"evacuation of the Jews.\\\"  But archives officials said \\\"extermination\\\" is the word he actually spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.  Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's \\\"final solution of the Jewish question,\\\" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.  The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum here on April 26.  The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of Himmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.   ---From p.A10 of Saturday's L.A.

Having said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.  1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards identify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S. citizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are just trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or religious identity to any public official who so requests ?  2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all kinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy. You did not respond to my question.  3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is interesting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear weapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?  4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a Ma'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases like Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and imprisoned.  5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status of the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for the occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law). The law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so, why doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?  6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return conflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands of non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under Israel control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from returning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also left, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to return. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ? Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in his homeland ?  7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that information, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all inhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other atrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by Israeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University Press. Is this book available in your library ?  8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in Israeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very little evidence available about that. As much as I know, many Arabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are not accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want Arabs ?  9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was whether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to discourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but evaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants to keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious communities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests to officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a secular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.   I would be glad to have some more input from you after these comments.\",\" This is a very good point.  One that I have held for sometime.  We do not allow people to develop on the paths that they choose or desire.  Even with heterosexuals we tend to leave some hanging in the sense of knowledge and information about sexuality and relationships.  It is very difficult for a young person to develop and build a positive view of themself when they are constantly being told implicitly and explicitly that they are wrong and immoral. \",\"Personally, I follow the no alcohol rule when I'm on a bike.  My view is that you have to be in such a high degree of control that any alcohol could be potentially hazardous to my bike!  If I get hurt it's my own fault, but I don't want to wreck my Katana.  I developed this philosophy from an impromptu *experiment*.  I had one beer at 6:00 in the evening and had volleyball practice at 7:00.

The former is  rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that  could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.     As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to ban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they  need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont  have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, they talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed. They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without  court order even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on  their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright? I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all (legal) ways possible.\",\"The Toshiba has a 200ms access time, the NEC has a 280ms access time, right around the Sony/Apple. Access time is, of course, somewhat important, but not as vital in the case of CDs as data transfer rate.  All the drives are double-speed drives with maximum data transfer rates of 300K/second. Any is a good choice. Apple's is very cheap when included with new Macs and I agree with Christian's comment about drivers.  Plus, Apple's is bootable on the Centris and Quadra 800.

The primary U.S. objection is ``Iran's international behaviour'' which includes ``extending support of violence'' to disrupt the Arab Israeli peace process and its rapid build-up of dangerous weapons.  Mack said ``Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace but first it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area.''  Mack spoke at the U.S.-GCC business conference aimed at promoting Gulf-American trade. He said the ``Middle East will be an item very high on the agenda of the U.S. administration.''  The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State Warren Christoper's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhere else in the world, Mack said. He added that the U.S. has no long-term plan to station troops in the Gulf.  Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue to pressure Iraq to ``comply with all the U.N. Security resolutions.''  ``As long as Iraq is ruled by Saddam Hussein we do not expect compliance,'' Mack told delegates. \",\"While playing around with my Gateway 2000 local-bus machine last night, it became apparent that Windows 3.1 didn't give the option for 32-bit access for virtual memory.

I guess I don't think it's out of line to talk about a generalized repentence for our contribution to or participation in \\\"The sins of society\\\" , or for our tacit approval (by our silence) of sinful attitudes or practices....it may be that we're also just plain begging for mercy, hoping God will withhold his hand of judgement on our whole country for the sake of a few, much as Abraham sought to do for the sake of Lot.  (Hmmm, the results there were pretty cautionary...)  A few times lately when I've observed some either out-and-out sinful  activity, or just some self-destructive activity, I've gotten a strong impression that many folks really don't know any better.  Christ's pity on the crowds as being \\\"like sheep without a shepherd\\\" rings true to me. If these folks don't have a clue, do I bear _any_ responsibility for my not having communicated a better way?  Worse still; have I expressed  judgement and disgust at their doings, and thus alienated them from any  positive relationship whereby I might pass along anything positive?

We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard Scanjet IIp was purchased this week.  Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:  John Sorenson Carol Sigelman Carla Moore Barbara Moose Judith Schrier  Again, thank you to all who gave!  I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to  review the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.   It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett  Packard Scanners.    When initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options;  (1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3)  automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image.   I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which  parts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.  Once an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The  software gives you two \\\"errors\\\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were  converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.   Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted  correctly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more  credit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue,  you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal  dictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited,  considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary.   After a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word  processor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a  seperate TIFF or PCX file format.  I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  an Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.   While most of my faxes were received in \\\"standard\\\" mode (200x100 dpi), the  accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent.   Overall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the  limitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just  too small.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has  been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g.,  Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus,  Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences  of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera,  malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore,  control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug  resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease,  salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging  infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those  in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and  minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of  emerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more  effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs  (3).       This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \\\"Emerging Infectious  Diseases.\\\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as  surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and  public health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation  of an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4).   References  1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that  identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from  one restaurant chain. Washington       On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of  Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an  increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a  case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or  postdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls  implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset  (matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January  18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants  was initiated.       As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January- February 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the  state health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case  definition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS  (Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with  confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of  symptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A  restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients  who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating  a regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17  through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30  developed HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years  (range: 0-74 years). Idaho       Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health,  Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture- confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December  11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were  hospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13  (93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California       In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was  notified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died.  Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with  E. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993.  Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was  reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27%  increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January  1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as  postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured,  or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with  onset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993.       Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The  outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen  persons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median  age of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of  the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community  controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched  OR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients  who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular- sized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3).  Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada       On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten  at a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District  issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea  contact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody  diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness  with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with  onset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local  laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools  for E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After  SMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of  one patient 38 days after illness onset.       Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine  were hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range:  0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex- matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during  the week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence  limit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients  also implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7- 49.8). Other Investigation Findings       During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases  primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November  19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \\\"jumbo\\\" patties produced on  November 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11  lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed  to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672  (20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall.       A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the  United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing  the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter  plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one  slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.       Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in  families and child day care settings is ongoing.

Editorial Note: E. coli O157:H7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first  identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody  diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). This pathogen has since  emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common  cause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked  most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other  food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been  implicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter  study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7  that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10  participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a  higher rate than for any other pathogen.       Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most  clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  SMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses  associated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea  (often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups  and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and  complications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients  develop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,  renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%.       This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community  outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite  the magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in  three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington  (1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from  persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5).  When infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported  to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public  health action to prevent further cases.       E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can  contaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S.  Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify  critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce  the likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply.  Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with  pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens  from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be  internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook  ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices  are clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played  an important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim  recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to  155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993).       Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report  and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be  consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of  outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of  this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections  caused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E.  coli O157:H7.

Long-term use of  smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of  oral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who  currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1).  To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products,  CDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease  Prevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing  tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian,  noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This  report summarizes findings from this survey.       The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \\\"Have you used snuff at least 20  times in your entire life?\\\" and \\\"Do you use snuff now?\\\" Similar questions were  asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of  smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco  use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the  time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having  used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the  time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and  former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at  least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as  those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not  smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on  smokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or  equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide  national estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using  standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN)  (3).       In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users  of smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%)  women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco  use was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was  highest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was  highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan  Natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American  Indians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was  substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in  rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only  for women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1).       Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those  aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of  chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although  women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest  among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.       An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being  former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were  former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons  aged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users  (56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95%  CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users  was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5%  95% CI=68.9-78.1).       Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0)  currently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95%  CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95%  CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco.       Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3%  95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6- 49.6).   Reported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease  Prevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National  Center for Health Statistics, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless  tobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in  particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that  link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral  snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this  behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for  nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4).       Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among  racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels  and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require  further explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role  in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the  differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6).       In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current  smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the  prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco  users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous  study among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  occasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked  reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to  stop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health  implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use.       The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special  population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless  tobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year  2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more  than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the  prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless  tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts,  enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes  commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to  routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based  prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit  tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).

I was wondering how you filled your crankcase though as I welded my hood shut also out of fear that somebody might steal my air-filter.\",\"  Dr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally  be believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing  Goebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks  who are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's  informed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For  instance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they  watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can  read the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what  really happened.   There are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee  Alumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society,  the Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation,  the Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek  Men's Lycee Foundation.    As for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish'  in titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts  have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association,  the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti  Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks in Western Thrace. Such community associations had been  active until 1984. But they were first told to remove the word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down. This is also the  final verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.  In the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish parentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment with no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was of Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three  years. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than  a vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority  complex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye.   The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,'  which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference  to 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the  existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the  essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger  Turkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the  three nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of  themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized  according to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'  It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece  and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world. The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish minority. They pursue the same denial in connection with  the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition, in 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091, virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting religious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek  governments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective of the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in Greece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders. Talk about democracy.  The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic  convention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an  attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a  violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called'  Greek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection  of historical monuments.   The government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new  churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward  Hellenizing the region.  And you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human  Rights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by  the Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation  of the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation,  Sidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of  Kefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina.  His employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in  24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his  involvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice  and remains without a job.   Helsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating  the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their  findings were published in a report titled    'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'  The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the  Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance,  the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in  Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against  the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the  Lausanne Convention.   The Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik were attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in Karotas was razed by bulldozers.  Shall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going  to take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The  discussion of human rights violations in Greece does not  stop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles  I shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks in Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.  It has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration  has an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made  plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it  has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on  conventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek  and Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned  to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the  transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern  Cyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of  the agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.  An acceptable method may certainly be found when there is a will. But we know of various kinds of violent behaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning of buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were  dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there.  Shots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.  Now wait, there is more.

For few past days I've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync 3D (predecessor of 3FG) to work properly with the internal video of Mac IIvi.  With a VGA-adapter (as described in Dale Adams' posting about Quadra video) it works, only some minor interferences occur, small enough not to prevent any action on screen to be visible & clear.  But because the scanrates & stuff of 3D are well enough for emulating Apple 13\\\" RGB, I first made an adapter, then got one fron the local distributor of NEC. With both adapters I can get a picure, which looks excellent most of the time or every now and then. But with radical changes on screen (opening palettes, large windows etc.) there are major interferences in sync. The picture either tilts sideways or scrables up totally. Even when it is clear, there are some \\\"spiky\\\" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing pull-downs etc. With the self-made adapter, almost identical to the VGA one, only sense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a picture clear enough to shut down from menu... With the adapter from NEC, everything is well most of the time, but sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely lost. But not nearly as often as with the self-made one.  I know, with self made adapters there can always be interference, but with the one provided by NEC... where's the source of this interference?  I'll give you the pinouts of the whole mess, and I hope that you can, at least someone (please try =) figure out what could be the best pin assignment for NEC 3D. I am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and isolations, as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be arranged, especially syncs and groundings.  Yes, I have checked that the monitor is not defective, it works perfectly well with all PC graphic adapters up to 1024x768 pixels and also Atari 71Hz monochrome, which I am using now with it.

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.  Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise OED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument.  Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job.  Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \\\"It is raining\\\" or \\\"Today is Tuesday\\\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to be true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning of \\\"deny\\\", not the everyday meaning.  The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular arrangement of words used to express it.  So \\\"God exists\\\" and \\\"There exists a God\\\" both express the same proposition.  An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \\\"a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition\\\".  An argument consists of three stages.  First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions.   Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \\\"because\\\", \\\"since\\\", \\\"obviously\\\" and so on.  (The phrase \\\"obviously\\\" is often viewed with suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to question it.  You can always say \\\"Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious\\\" when you've heard the explanation.)  Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of valid inference.  The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \\\"implies that\\\" or \\\"therefore\\\".  Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as \\\"therefore\\\", \\\"it follows that\\\", \\\"we conclude\\\" and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.  For example:  Every event has a cause (premise) The universe has a beginning (premise) All beginnings involve an event (premise) This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference) Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)  Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.  Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example, the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated  afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if  sometimes a little confusing.  Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some statements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:  \\\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,  or the Son of God.\\\"  This is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its  conclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll come to those later.)  Another example:  \\\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\\\"  The phrase \\\"do your duty to God\\\" is not a proposition, since it is neither true nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an argument.  Finally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \\\"A because B\\\".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the statement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then it is not an argument, it is an explanation.  For example:  \\\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not  start.\\\" -- This is an argument.  \\\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\\\"  -- This is an explanation.  There are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions -- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion is true.  An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid; however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments, and about how probable their premises are.  There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.  It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly  counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more carefully.  Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions.  For example:     All insects have wings (premise)    Woodlice are insects (premise)    Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)  Here, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false.  If the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true.  The argument is thus entirely valid.  More subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises, as in:     All fish live in the sea (premise)    Dolphins are fish (premise)    Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)  However, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \\\"truth table\\\" for implication.  The symbol \\\"=>\\\" denotes implication; \\\"A\\\" is the premise, \\\"B\\\" the conclusion.  \\\"T\\\" and \\\"F\\\" represent true and false respectively.  Premise Conclusion Inference    A        B        A=>B ----------------------------    F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference    F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.     T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion                              false, the inference must be invalid.     T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,                              the conclusion must be true.  A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound  argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments.  To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.  In everyday English the term \\\"fallacy\\\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair enough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or convincing.  So for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive.  ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)  The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \\\"might makes right\\\".  The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.  For example: \\\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM  Argumentum ad hominem is literally \\\"argument directed at the man\\\".  The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.  For example: \\\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\\\"  Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by  showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not argumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's testimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).  The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent's particular circumstances.  For example: \\\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue otherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?\\\"  This is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent's argument.  This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For  example:  \\\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing.  You're white.\\\"  This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is also known as \\\"poisoning the well\\\".  ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM  Argumentum ad ignorantium means \\\"argument from ignorance\\\".  This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true, a basic scientific principle.)  Examples: \\\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\\\"  \\\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has shown any proof that they are real.\\\"  Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty.  Also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can  validly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:  \\\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water, even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no such flood occurred.\\\"  In science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred, however.  ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM  This is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is  committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a  conclusion accepted.  For example:  \\\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me guilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan.\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM  This is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language.  For example:  \\\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\\\"  \\\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM  This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more likely it is that that proposition is correct.  ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM  The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion.  For example:  \\\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\\\"  This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly between:  \\\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\\\" and \\\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent  computer\\\"  Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable  whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.  THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT  The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose \\\"accidental\\\" circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific.  For example:  \\\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must dislike atheists.\\\"  This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.  CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION  This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases.  For example: \\\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are insincere.\\\"  SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER  A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization.  NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  These are known as False Cause fallacies.  The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For  example:  \\\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God cured me of the headache.\\\"  The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For  example:  \\\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons.\\\"  CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.  PETITIO PRINCIPII  This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached.  CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO  This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:  \\\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job.  Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open to blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office.\\\"  Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the  conclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees.  Another example is the classic:  \\\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God.\\\"  COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION  This is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded  question:  \\\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\\\"  The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination, when they ask questions like:  \\\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\\\"  Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:  \\\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\\\" or \\\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\\\"  IGNORATIO ELENCHI  The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument  supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion.  For example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.  Sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light.  EQUIVOCATION  Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument.  For example:  \\\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\\\"  AMPHIBOLY  Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing.  ACCENT  Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case, the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized.  For example, consider:  \\\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\\\" and \\\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\\\"  FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION  One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole.  For example:  \\\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very  lightweight.\\\"  The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:  \\\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses.\\\"  FALLACY OF DIVISION  The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like its opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:  \\\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\\\"  The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item.  For example:  \\\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\\\"  THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT  This argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful events.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event.  For example: \\\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana.\\\"  \\\"A IS BASED ON B\\\" FALLACIES / \\\"IS A TYPE OF\\\" FALLACIES  These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.  Examples: \\\"Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of history?\\\"  \\\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a form of Christianity?\\\"  \\\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?\\\"  AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form \\\"A implies B, B is true, therefore A is true\\\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for implication given earlier.  DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form \\\"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\\\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy.  Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has the form \\\"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\\\", where A does NOT in fact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is invalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about B.  CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL  This fallacy is an argument of the form \\\"If A then B, therefore if B then A\\\".  ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM  This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old, or because \\\"that's the way it's always been.\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM  This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else.  ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM  The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those with more money are more likely to be right.  ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM  The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam.  ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM  This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard.  An \\\"argumentum ad nauseum\\\" is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something.  BIFURCATION  Also referred to as the \\\"black and white\\\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist.  PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS  This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question.  NON SEQUITUR  A non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it.  RED HERRING  This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the points being made, towards a different conclusion.  REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION  Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.  SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF  The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.  STRAW MAN  The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position, then to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made.  THE EXTENDED ANALOGY  The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two  different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a  claim that those situations are analogous to each other.  This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about  anti-cryptography legislation:  \\\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\\\"  \\\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported  Martin Luther King.\\\"  \\\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the  struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\\\"  TU QUOQUE  This is the famous \\\"you too\\\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:  \\\"You're just being randomly abusive.\\\" \\\"So?  You've been abusive too.\\\"\",\"  i would like to remind my jewish colleague mzm that much of the stories of the holocaust (including the ones in the u.s. holocaust memorial museum) were *not* eaten up by some of the papers.  we just have to wait to build muesums for it..    \",\":    Watch us soar in 1993!

But you claim these are villages with civilians, and Iraelis claim they are  camps filled with terrorists. You claim that israelis shell the villages with the 'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad,  civilians die, right ? I am not so sure.   As somebody wrote, Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting manner. And he also claimed 'civilians murdered'. Let me ask you, isn't there  at least a slight chance that you (not only, and the question is very general,  no insult) are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in southern Lebanon ?  Now, a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil' kind of Mediteranean sea. How do you define Israeli soil ? From what you say, if you do not clearly  recognize the state of Israel, you condone killing israelis anywhere.   I do not know what was the pupose of the action you describe.

If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a  question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing justifies murder. I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ? Am I wrong ?   Now tell me, did you also condone Saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in, let's say, Tel Aviv ? From what I understand, a lot of palestineans cheered. What does it show? It does not qualify for freedom fighting to me ?

It takes of vertically.    For several reasons.  Vertical landings don't require miles of runway and limit noise pollution.  They don't require wheels or wings.  Just turn on the engines and touch down.  Of course, as Henry pointed out, vetical landings aren't quite that simple.   Well, to be blunt, yes.  But at least you're learning.   The Soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets just before they hit the ground.

It is sometimes used as a framework to view Scripture.  But if you look at Collosions, without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be  a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.  against us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days, or the keeping of the sabbath.  The word for sabbath in this verse is \\\"sabbaton\\\" and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.  If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption \\\"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law\\\" then he will have to find some way around it, like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the 7tH day, Because \\\"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.\\\"  But Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal  statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings.  Also, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which talks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society that did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were slaves.

What I mean is that our  culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather than considering things with others in mind and not making prayer  an initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend to treat church as they would a club and when something is less than to their liking, off they go to another one.  I think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different  perspective on the \\\"church choosing process\\\". It seems to me from 1Cor 12 that God doesn't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all but that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a better question is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where God is trying to place me.  If a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church they go to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family of God. People should hop around from church to church as often as they hop from natural family to family.  If you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an  easily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are more like an orphan. Prayerfully go and \\\"leave yourself on a few doorsteps\\\" and see if anyplace feels like home.   I wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where you have difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other hand there are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of looking for problems you will both find them and make them. On the other hand if you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread that wherever you go.   In general, I think that God will try to place you in a church that talks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is expanding on that base.\",\" Gee!  Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something  I say can't be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \\\"scientific\\\"  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \\\"If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.\\\"    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \\\"There've got to be controlled studies\\\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying \\\"We don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.\\\"    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  \\\"Why should I prove your  theory?\\\"  and  \\\"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\\\"   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of  books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as I'm capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \\\"doctrinnaire\\\"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\": >NEWSPAPER AD CENSORSHIP : > : >San Fran.

I don't think it is the function overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time in BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered in porting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of invalid C++ assumptions.  I have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but the reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in which static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are getting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the owner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all other pieces of ctrltest work fine.  Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:  - The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,   rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ   between MSC and BC).  - All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++   assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place   of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for   references).  I am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have not encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope that some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS's hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that. \",\"    No....Hal McRae is the worst manager in baseball.

A tutorial will be on Thursday the 24th and the conference proper on the 25th with the annual meeting at the dinner on the evening between the two days.  All conference attendees are welcome at the annual meeting, though only Consortium members will be able to vote.  This year's theme is    Application Construction by Non-Programmers  Much of the effort on X toolkits has been aimed at programmer construction of applications.  There have, however, been some excellent UIMS systems built on top of X.  Papers addressing the theme will consider questions such as  What is needed for application construction by non-programmers?  Can we avoid programming altogether, or is a simple language needed?  Is it sufficient to create applications, or must users be able to create new widgets?  Should widgets and applications be able to print themselves?  Your participation in the conference is welcome.  Papers are appropriate on the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System, including   applications  experience with users  new objects  reviews of and proposals for revision of    internal Andrew protocols  We expect to have an RS/6000 with video projector available if you would like to do a demonstration.    Paper proposals should be submitted by 15 May 1993. Acceptance will be 1 June with final papers due by 15 June.

Here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects.  One is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related public relations campaign about Iran in recent months. These include:  1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade    Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not    succeeded in this. They, however, have indirectly created    the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist    Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.  2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and    other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and    outlaw state.  3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I     suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and    perhaps intensify.  Why this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have been behind this. These include:  1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical    Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This    movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily    fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this     movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return    colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of    democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian    military coup against the democratically elected Algerian    Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.    A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news    on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.  2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia    and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil    sources from this region.  3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense    expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of    Soveit Union.  The recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed from Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict of interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal and friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on the rise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran .\",\"Any comments of AMD microprocessors?  good?, bad?\",\" Who is the you Arabs here.

Say, for example, there are people living on a volcanic island, and a group  of geologists determine that a volcano is imminent. They warn the people on  the island that they are in danger, and should leave. A group of people on  the island is given the task of warning others of the danger.  They believe the danger is real, but others may not.   Does that mean that the first group are NECESSARILY arrogant in warning  others of the danger? Does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs  are correct, and all others are false?  Some might indeed react to opposition with arrogance, and behave in an  arrogant manner, but that is a personal idiocyncracy.

I have my eye on two choices.  Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.  Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales (according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169 mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.  I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400 dpi) and price ($149).    Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of prices.  Which should I buy?  If you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would recommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range (under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.

I've been seeing  her every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28)  and during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every  4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period.  As it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that  though I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she  mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13  weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had  an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no  problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain  in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very  difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or  move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for  when I do need to go out.)   Anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from  the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about  2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.   (I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating  very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well  now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile  related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my  upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I  was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because  it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt   no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I  ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had  turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if  I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it  wasn't as much of a problem.  So the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid  fatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware  of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have  been avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat  foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.    But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat  except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts,  fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I  should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only  have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day (  potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in  a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or  steamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have  some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if  I'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it  from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if  she's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her  recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on  cholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She  originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the  entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I  started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and  she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also  asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them  are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain,  and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did  want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be  temporary for that one week.   What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I  would understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying  that anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she  assumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that  because of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to  use the energy from the food I do eat.   Any opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.

April 23, 1993 (Phone:  202/358-1780)  Kyle Herring Johnson Space Center, Houston (Phone:  713/483-5111)  RELEASE:  93-76  HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS   The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability for an additional two, if needed.   The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times required using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual EVA tasks on previous missions.   \\\"Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the dynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,\\\" Mission Director Randy Brinkley said. \\\"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.\\\"   In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the spacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives during the mission.   \\\"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through lowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays, WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each spacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate,\\\" said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight Director for the mission.   While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than previous missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.   \\\"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,\\\" Heflin said.  \\\"In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible to accomplish the mission objectives.\\\"   Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions that include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated simulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone underwater training \\\"runs\\\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.   Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the mission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight will be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.   Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission. The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.   Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the experience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and trainers.   Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.   The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that time the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in 1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have become necessary.\",\"  I think we agree on much.  However the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of \\\"progress\\\" and \\\"rationality\\\" in science.  Since I've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past, I won't go into them again now.  What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps even the \\\"correct\\\") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes \\\"forward\\\" (and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the \\\"critical function\\\" of science.  (Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery. If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true of the application of any \\\"critical function\\\" concerning replication. This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an \\\"anything goes\\\" view.)  True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is *not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science.\",\"   Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else, one can get too much of a good thing.   Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries, essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her, necessarily.    Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected.     These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.    People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that \\\"pisses off\\\" their body. Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard, causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it.    See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly.  and brain damage.   The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin, and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.   poisoning.   Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating , say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home, plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of things.  But it might be the MSG.    If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.   Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.\",\" John 1:1 says (NKJV - the little green gideon someone forced on me one day) \\\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was  God.\\\"  The Word refers to Jesus Christ so from this John declares that God and Jesus are one.  Therefore, \\\"The Lord\\\" refers to both.  Also, David in the Psalms refers to both God in heaven and the coming messiah as his Lord.  Once again this refers to God and Jesus.     swear/curse?  Does it say anything about this in the bible?  Some of the most \\\"truly religious\\\" people I've known have not been Christians and some of the greatest Christians I've known have been truly irreligious. However, to answer your question: The bible speaks of this in many places, A previous post to James is a good one.  Another is Psalm 15: \\\"Lord, who may abide in your tabernacle?  Who may dwell in your holy hill?  He who walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart He who does not backbite with his tongue, nor does evil to his neighbor, nor does he take up a reproach against his friend; I whose eyes a vile person is despised, but he honors those who fear the Lord; he who swears to his own hurt and does not change; He who does not put out money at usury, nor does he take a bribe aginst the innocent.

Any reason given for this?  Also, I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline in the preview. On 8/22/89, Rickey Henderson became Nolan's 5000th strikeout. On 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe the last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolan pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his 939th base, which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot of publicity at Rickey's expense. IMO, Rickey deserves it, and it seems as most of the net agrees with me from what I've seen on it lately. They are both great players, but IMO, Nolan has outclassed Rickey, both in playing and more importantly, in attitude.

In other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice    but to obey.  This is a primary problem in the Church today.  What you are saying is more or less heresy.  You might call it \\\"infallibilism\\\".  It's the idea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does. This is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.  The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and well-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he can make mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.  A couple historical examples come to mind.  Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the English Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigning Pope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  Bishop Grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though maybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, even when they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would just collect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there. This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop Grosseteste was quite right in what he did!  Another example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages. He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific Vision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a defined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn't quite get around to defining it.  Now there's no way this is compatible with Catholic doctrine.  The Pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church. He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In the end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he recanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the Church.  If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such subjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you will find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall into heresy or schism.\",\" Gee.

About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes  under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement  of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of  the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced  the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor   suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.   While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being   manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently  increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (  palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part  the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had  been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the  pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is   persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3  and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides  minor reductions in pain and is only short term.     My questions are:        Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the      levels of pain?       Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?       Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?     Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.         Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.

In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called \\\"stolen hits\\\", defined as a play made that \\\"an average fielder would not make with average effort.\\\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \\\"Plays Kurt Stillwell would not have made.\\\"  OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by?  To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double Plays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).  Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't take it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article.  The short version -- definition of terms HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder NEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.

BUT government  should supply those necessary goods and services only when it is impossible  for a private enterprise (or individual) to make money from providing them. I agree with some of the other posts that this train probably can not make  money and will rely heavily on State tax dollars.    The question, I think, then becomes:  Do we, the general public, need the train?  I certainly do not, nor will I ever, need this train in Lubbock, Texas.

What about guys like: Nieminen, Jutila, Riihijarvi, Varvio, Laukkanen, Makela, Keskinen and (even if he is aging) Ruotsalainen? The main difference between finnish and North- American players is, that our players tend to be better in the larger rink. The Canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in Europe.  And I think that there was more in our success than Ketterer and luck (though they helped).

I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published  solutions to it.   The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw  the object we   1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively  computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume  that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not  exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable  measure. 2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment  of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two  triangles which will be filled in to color the surface. 3) Depth sort the triangles 4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw  and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is  along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge  colored with a special \\\"edge color\\\"   It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface. The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated. They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area.\",\"Panasonic KX-T3000H, Combo black cordless & speaker phone all in one.  new- $160, now- $100 + shipping OBO.

The  federal protection of individual rights supersedes the non-feasance of the state. Something similar has long been traditional ( well he's queer so I beat him up...) for gays   As Anatole France said; \\\"The law in its impartial majesty forbids the rich as well as the poor from sleeping under bridges.\\\"  Equality of law can be construed in any number of ways. For example the fact that all property thefts, regardless of value, are not punished equally is an inequality which protects those who have a lot of money from having it stolen. You could easily define equality to regard the property in terms of it's significance for the owner. This would a form of equality that would be skewed toward poorer people.  In fact, most anti-gay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal  protection. They make it an offense to damage people based on a  motivation of hatred for sexual orientation. Thus the law in its impartial majesty protects hets as well as gays from being bashed.

Anyway, I think it would be a great idea to  develop such a product, perhaps in the underground, as it would otherwise  probably become illegal pretty quickly here...  It's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's needed is a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codec functions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.  You'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and have a good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in the middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on a byte stream.  With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work.  Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.  At the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatible modems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on the cost of such a box.  In practice, you really ought to be able to get the price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nasty home RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I bought for 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software (which I don't).  The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one - the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip. Economics, I'm afraid.  However... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with the bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha) and the new NREN, it might then be trivial to run compressed speech over a tcp/ip connection on the Internet.  Perhaps we should start thinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible for everyone, and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet for all our phone calls in future :-)  [1/2 joking]\",\"****************************   SPHINX   ***************************   Sphinx is a user-friendly, state-of-the-art image processing and analysis package that runs across a spectrum of high performance  computer platforms operating UNIX and the X-Window System.   It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists  conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques.        Intuitive Graphic Interface   Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and  point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast.  This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image  layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.        Image Format Compatibility   Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.        Image Analysis & Processing   For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution  product or principal component analyses. An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions.        Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis   Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.). The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation, and 3-D image projection.        Easy External Program Interfacing   Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions.        Quick Quality Presentation   Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images, graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as  histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers.  Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external  graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?        Software Support & Development    Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)  of the Universite de Lille, France. The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features on-line help, is supported by an Internet address   sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and  version updates provided without delay.        Performance Tested    CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data  collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today, the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center and is widely used in many French laboratories, including the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure , Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire  de Meteorologie Dynamique.

This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride    (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty,     fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).

I've been doing it my self over 200,000 miles, on my current toyota truck I've got over 150k. I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission. My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use?  On some old pieces of junk I drove, the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless. To date I've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy. Some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker & easier they where to shift.  My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window, I lightly press the accelerator & try agian. I've found that clutchless shifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000). I also skip gears some times using 1-3-5 ,1-2-4-5. \",\"One thing to consider is time division multiplexing the EMG channels to reduce the number of RF carriers you have to generate. If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably be sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz per channel sampling rate.)  That level of analog multiplexing should be rather easy to accomplish.  Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without generating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner is in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to keep balanced.  A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth.

The above certainly says a mouthful about the mindset of Ted Frank, and also of statists everywhere.\",\"Went to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night.   Astacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night. In the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then a single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the throw home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.   Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza batting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder and Webster.   Piazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards. The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by Offerman.   By the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but the score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive plays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner trying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base, etc.   Karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into the outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going through, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw to third and EASILY got the runner at third.   My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.   Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game with the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.   Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3 innings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning game had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh given his light work out Tuesday.   Gross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit to the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted in a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it 3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next thing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had scored long before that.   Meanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning. Lee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros and Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?). Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but that was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his third straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my free Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this up all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year.   The final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits. Dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.\",\" These new rule changes are great!  However, I think that your rules are MUCH too complicated.  How will the normal average fan be able to count how many fouls a player has?  And then we would even have to remember the names of the players, in order to determine who drew the foul!

Dave Bell dbell@coral.bucknell.edu\",\"  Back in the 70's I was a service technician for a cash register company. The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were VERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise.  The biggest problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.  In almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outlets with the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things you can plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers they were a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memory periodically.  With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be less of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longer recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their equipment.  I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will find that the ground and neutral are connected.  Although not ideal, it should be o.k. for most applications.  ---  . SLMR 2.1 .

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is public-key cryptography? * What's RSA? * Is RSA secure? * How fast can people factor numbers? * What about other public-key cryptosystems?   * What is public-key cryptography?    In a classic cryptosystem, we have encryption functions E_K and   decryption functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for any plaintext   P. In a public-key cryptosystem, E_K can be easily computed from some   ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published, so   that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed   from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.   That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie   and Hellman in 1976.    In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to   send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than   them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,   and you don't have to worry about spies.    This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an   extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,   applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the   mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.  * What's RSA?    RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and   Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at   RSA.COM. Here's a small example.    Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples   (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,   and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We   define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.    Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as   anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair   (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a   secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.  * Is RSA secure?    Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.   See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization   algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to   prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that   matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by   ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,   ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to   prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and   theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative   results.''  * How fast can people factor numbers?    It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra   and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three   weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;   each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The   algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a   bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers   n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in   any case.    An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple   polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n   log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,   but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100   and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.    Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few   years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are   developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from   factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number   field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic   sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)  * What about other public-key cryptosystems?\",\"It seems to me that all discussions about Clipper security are almost  irrelevant - if I cannot choose the key, but have to use a key chosen for me by the foundry, the security of the WHOLE UNIVERSE OF USERS is as good (or as bad) as the security of VLSI Technologies Inc.

The \\\"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\\\" ASC G&C 2102,   \\\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is  commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower  clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)  orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a  negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other  advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort  maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of  the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining  downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target  in second stage.\\\"      This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try     to interpret.      1) We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2) Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack  between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the  \\\"relative wind\\\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line  between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly  negative angle (\\\"a negative q-alpha\\\"). This causes a little bit of  \\\"downward\\\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z  direction) and this force \\\"alleviates structural loading.\\\"  We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the  most \\\"delicate\\\" part of the vehicle.      3) The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more  mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or  to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be  the case if we didn't roll (\\\"performance gain\\\").      4) The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated  flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort  maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\\\"decreased abort maneuver  complexity\\\").      5) The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio  antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio  antennae on the Orbiter (\\\"improved S-band look angles\\\").      6) The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a  helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7) The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is  more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east  (usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity  in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:  velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.  The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its  velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question, \\\"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?\\\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \\\"top\\\"     [Orbiter side] and the \\\"bottom\\\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the     Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics. He added that the \\\"roll     maneuver\\\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.     The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a \\\"quaternion,\\\" a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.       HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT      NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite     dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72     degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed     over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from     California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.     It's worth asking if yours doesn't.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.

CONTROLLER VS9         The function of VS-9 controller is to load TV-images into  PC/AT.        VS-9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV-frame from        a field of 724x600 pixels.        The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in        the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image. This        provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal        and vertical directions.        The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.        Video signal capture time - 2.5s.                       CONTROLLER VS52         The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM        PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was        created on the base of modern elements, including user        programmable gate arrays.        The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different        resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change        technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any        other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning        devices).        The controller has the following technical characteristics:        - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;        - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64        to 1024x512 pixels ;        - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024        pixels;        - video signal capture time - 40 ms.        - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024        pixels ;        - number of gray level - 256 ;        - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;        - 4 input video multiplexer ;        - input/output lookup table (LUT);        - possibility to realize \\\"scroll\\\" and \\\"zoom\\\";                     - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external        controlling signal) ;        - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -        digital converter;        - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.

It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   \\\"program\\\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even   hole filling.    The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.    GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,   documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been   developed by Spyglass.

It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,   tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting   things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of   images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined   convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw   data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also   does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,   though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac   that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version   from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)  PhotoMac --------   Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700  PhotoPress ----------   Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973  PixelTools and TCL-Image ------------------------   \\\"Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications   software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,   blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,   EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,   PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the \\\"auto selection tool\\\"   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close   hues, color range and mask.

One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by \\\"painting\\\" it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator \\\"paint\\\" with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr.

Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: \\\"Laplacian, medium noise filter\\\", etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,   the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu   (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)   Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,   VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic, etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is   available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - \\\"AIPS++\\\" - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and   Australia to name a few.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using   the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Been around for   a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000   with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display\\\"  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil   exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual   pages, and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.   For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun   console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X   windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of   convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,    byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or    without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,    line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp    masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,    line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan    bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to    region target mean, median, or modal value. o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,    brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive    background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical    aperture shape to image isophotes.  o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot    of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`    centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,    change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and    adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function    or histogram equalization. o  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for    registration. o  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or    2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers    can be cycled through. Interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting,    point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and    quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights    or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass    back to calling function. Dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars)    to file or printer.  Change to user specified coordinate system. o  Tricolor image combination and display, hardcopy halftone printout to    HP-PCL compatible printers (Laserjet, deskjet, etc.) o  Documentation is over 300 pages in custom vinyl binder.

In fact, a calf _must_ have a sufficient amount of colostrum (early milk) within 12 hours to effectively develop the immune system, since for the first (less than) 24 hours the intestines are \\\"open\\\" to the IG passage.  My question is, does this apply to human infants to any degree?\",\"  Well, I don't recall assuming anything, except perhaps that the columnist  who reported the incident was telling the truth i.e. the sarcastic impression came from _him_ (Steve Simmons?).

Very low. \",\"  So, did the Jews kill the Germans?  You even make Armenians laugh.  \\\"An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the  systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of   the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at   least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

Our artillery knocked the huts   into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable   and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets   completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages.

[AFS]     Just a quick comment:: [AFS] [AFS]     Armenians killed Turks------Turks killed Armenians. [AFS] [AFS]     Simple as that. Can anybody deny these facts?  Jews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was  quite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi  revisionists say!  [SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in [SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups) [SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother. [SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were  [SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy  [SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not  [SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.  OK.  [SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my [SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these  [SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe  [SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people, [SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...  There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the Armenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno- Georgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever  killed in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of Anatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian- Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after the Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the extermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died in this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of preparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish  genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers away!  [SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people [SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women', [SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed [SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these  [SY] people not to hate all Armenians.   I don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.  [SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region, [SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation. [SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some [SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts. [SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish [SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with [SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately [SY] very easy to start a fire!  Again, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to do with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that the Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan,  and Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through  Tiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians  militarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of Caucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement  caused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years  earlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek ->  Erzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople ->  Massachusetts.   [SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience [SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were [SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to [SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves [SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.  My grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste potato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian young man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential, local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive  today.  [SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense. [SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But [SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. Why  [SY] should they become enemies?  \",\"   Some variant is quite popular.  This, and other arguments, are discussed in John Leslie Mackie's \\\"The Miracle of Theism: arguments for and against the existence of God\\\".

I can resolve to abstain from  sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail. I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided  the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation. If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.  To willingly judge \\\"others\\\" as deserving punishment seems to me to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.      So what's the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in \\\"deviant\\\" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS of deviant sexual behavior with HIV+ people and never be infected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors, many of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors carry the risk of transmission.      The end of all things is to know, love and serve God, growing daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  Even so I could get AIDS.

I grew up in New York City so I rode in many Checker cabs.  The jump seats were fun as a kid.  Although the cars were roomy -- a good trait for a taxi -- they had a design flaw that I don't understand they never fixed: the rear passengers tended to fall out of their seats when the driver braked.  I wouldn't want to take a long ride in the back seat of one of these vehicles.  Why did you like yours?  I never drove one, so I have to ask.\",\"Hi all,  I have a DLL in which I Register a class and create a window of that class type.  Both calls require a module instance handle, hInstance.  Petzold's 3.1 book says that it is best to use the module instance handle of the calling program, not the module instance handle of the DLL (page 934).  I have two questions:  1)  Is there a way to find out the module instance handle of a module?  2)  What are the possible problems with using the instance handle of     the DLL?

I was wondering if anyone has used the PowerVision adaptor made by Mirror.  If so, can you tell me how feel about the speed and compatability of it?

Thanks in advance.\",\"Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept.  It would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft. The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to ten megatons yield behind a \\\"pusher plate\\\" attached to the main spacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the ship.    Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave into the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton, helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission products).    Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once they're there.    I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?    Thanks.  --   --Jim \",\"Just an apology in advance for posting a binary to this newsgroup. I've had several attempts to mail it to the original poster but  it's not getting through intact. \",\"    The following is from a critique of a \\\"60 Minutes\\\" presentation on MSG    which was aired on November 3rd, 1991.  The critique comes from THE TUFTS    DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]   \\\"Chances are good that if you watched '60 Minutes' last November  3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In  the segment entitled 'No MSG,' for instance, show host Ed Bradley  makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them  ('millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently  sick'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven  personal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the  substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive   those studies are.   Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to  a study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order  to back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that MSG,  a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as  in many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT  make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on  humans but on rabbits.   One of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist  Patricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that  a small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get   headaches from it.  'But,' she explains, 'the show probably   overemphasized the extent of the problem.'   A second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor  at the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley  remarks, 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory  animals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' because  it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney's  research with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human  youngsters.   In fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney's   experiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected  extremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing   their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,  and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance  to very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither  of those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG   with food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by  enzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little  reaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human  blood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations  found in Dr. Olney's lab animals.....   The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of  that fact.  And so does the European Communities' Scientific  Committee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,  have concluded that MSG is safe.   Their determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never  been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed  to it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a  burning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe  of clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently  exonerated the much-maligned substance.   That's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of  monosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever  we eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one  of the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken  down into glutamate during digestion.   It's a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the  most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes  up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in  milk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.   That doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small number  of people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore  sensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international  professional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus  reached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large.\\\" \",\" Do people expect the Texans congressmen to act as the N.J.

The issue wasn't gays, but the principles were the same. Thanks for a well put testimonial. Stan Krieger and his kind who think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the only acceptable position in scouting should take notice. The BSA has been hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts haven't given up. Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that scouting is still worth fighting for.  On a cautionary note, you must realize that if your experience with this camp leader was in the BSA you may be putting him at risk by publicizing it.

An awful lot of the starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.  Perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children are dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the supposed \\\"Pro-Life\\\" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against abortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more of those by fighting for human rights in China.  And besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory forced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case. \",\"Anyone in Europe got any advice for a US citizen whose going to be living and working in Italy for a year and wants to buy a motorcycle there?

I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a pretty good centre - right wing combination, and the Bruins also got Brad Park in the deal (and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else). After the trade, the  Bruins were in two finals and one semi-final, all of which, of course, they  lost to Montreal (which should please you to no end).

Riston --  Riston\",\"I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band boxes in Motif/X.  I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using XPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay around when the window is refreshed.  Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with:     /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */    /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */    palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;    palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;    palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;    XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);    XFlush( myDisplay);     XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);    XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);  Then to draw I do:     XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);    XFlush( myDisplay);  And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do:     XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);   What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of whatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are over a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxor function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases and redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).  Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong?\",\"  ...

Cypherpunk remailer source is at soda.berkeley.edu in the   /pub/cypherpunks directory.  It's written in PERL, and is   relatively easy to install (no administrative rights are required).   Karl Barrus  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> has more information and   modifications. Also, most remailer operators mentioned above are   amenable to discussing features, problems, and helping new sites   become operational. Address all points in the section   ``responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to   advertising your service.  You should be committed to the long-term   stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously.  _____ <4.8> What are references on privacy in email?

For more   information send email to crosslink@athena.mit.edu.   MISCELLANEOUS =============  _____ <5.1> What is ``digital cash''?    With digital encryption and authentication technologies, the   possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be   realized.  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks   (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may   be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and   anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an   economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum   (~Dec.1992).    An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus   <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the   cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to   elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:      ::     command: help          user@host    where `user@host' is your email address.      _____ <5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?    These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,   especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past   a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as   breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most   internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a   ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,   curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a   system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and   patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also   the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.     _____ <5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?    From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:    > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were   > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy   > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,   > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant   > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people   > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,   > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek   > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or   > their opinions.    See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.    See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary   in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.  _____ <5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?    Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the   techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication   but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself.    Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the   proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible   to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,   typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is   posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually   untraceable  communication can take place between sender and   receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic   realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where   individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual   users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An   anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman   (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to   <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following   commands in the subject line:      subscribe     unsubscribe     help  _____ <5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?    `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain   protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information   or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make   public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade   `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be   concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in   operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that   some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious   because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This   argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet   posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a   very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at   worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ   for alt.security.        Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic   Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First   International Symposium on National Security & National   Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:    > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep   > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's   > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If   > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there   > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I   > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into   > an environment where any information which is at all interesting   > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little   > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,   > but you may differ...  _____ <5.6> What are `identity daemons'?      RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to   query a remote user's login name after connection to a local   communication socket (a connection of this type is established   during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not   widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement   it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to   anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system   adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a   trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.  _____ <5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?     Remailing/Posting   -----------------      - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,     publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.   - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET     postings.   - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information     obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,     encrypted addresses, etc.)   - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and     remailer site chaining.      General   -------      - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy     shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the     general public and their governments.   - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies      by systems designers into     hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'     `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.   - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than     wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement     agencies.   - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government     agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to     strengthening and protecting it.   ISSUES ======  _____ <6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?    From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:    > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic   > media which connect us.  Computer-based communication media like   > electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis   > of new forms of community.  These communities without a single,   > fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an   > electronic frontier.   >    > While well-established legal principles and cultural norms give   > structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like   > newspapers, books, and telephones, the new digital media do not   > so easily fit into existing frameworks.  Conflicts come about as   > the law struggles to define its application in a context where   > fundamental notions of speech, property, and place take   > profoundly new forms. People sense both the promise and the   > threat inherent in new computer and communications technologies,   > even as they struggle to master or simply cope with them in the   > workplace and the home.   >    > The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been established to help   > civilize the electronic frontier; to make it truly useful and   > beneficial not just to a technical elite, but to everyone; and to   > do this in a way which is in keeping with our society's highest   > traditions of the free and open flow of information and   > communication.      EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor, founder of   Lotus software, and John Barlow, lyricist for the Grateful Dead   rock band.  A highly publicized endeavor of the organization   involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI   raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``Steve   Jackson Games'').  The foundation publishes EFF News (EFFector   Online) electronically, send requests to effnews-request@eff.org.      In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee   with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated   November 5, 1991,  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented   Mitchell Kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national   public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly   by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' (complete text in    ftp.eff.com:/pub/pub-infra/1991-12):    > ...we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to   > work with other sectors of the communications industry to create   > a consumer-oriented, public information network. Please let me or   > my staff know what policies you and others in the computer   > industry believe would best serve the public interest in creating   > a reasonably priced, widely available network in which   > competition is open and innovation rewarded.  I also want to   > learn what lessons from the computer industry over the past ten   > to fifteen years should apply to the current debate on   > structuring the information and communications networks of the   > future....I ask your help in gaining input from the computer   > industry so that the Subcommittee can shape policies that will   > bring this spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship to the   > information services industry.      ftp.eff.org   ===========      /pub/eff/about-eff   ---     A file of basic information about EFF including goals, mission,     achievements, and current projects.

The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility have been   working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues   since ~1982.  The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,   Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation   against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other   U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation   on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,   NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in   Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on   Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to   testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and   caller identification.    CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available   via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising   the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For   more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.     (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions   here.)  _____ <6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?    In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies   on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in   such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.      (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):    > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May   > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card   > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success.    > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying   > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of   > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some   > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department   > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide   > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of   > jurisdictions.    Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated   instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a   crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal   search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of   Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST   by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science   Fiction Magazine:    > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional   > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the   > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared   > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,   > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin   > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only   > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place.    > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that   > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document   > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.    FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed   on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier   Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe   Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:      > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret   > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal   > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a   > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,   > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment.    >    > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in   > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,   > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke   > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer   > seizure policies.  While the Service has seized dozens of   > computers since the crackdown began in 1990, this is the first   > case to challenge the practice.    >    > Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin   > science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never   > suspected of a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal   > research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and   > the suspected illegal activities of an employee, or to determine   > that the company was a publisher. Indeed, agents testified that   > they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the   > special Secret Service school on computer crime.    >    > \\\"How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what   > Steve Jackson Games did, what it was?\\\" asked Sparks. \\\"An hour?    >    > \\\"Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to   > Steve Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything   > taken?    >    > \\\"Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had   > a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen   > -- saying he was a computer crime suspect?    >    > \\\"Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material   > could harm Steve Jackson economically?\\\"    >    > Foley replied, \\\"No, sir,\\\" but the judge offered his own answer.    >    > \\\"You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go   > out and hire a lawyer and sue you.\\\"    >    > More than $200,000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier    > Foundation in bringing the case to trial. The EFF was founded by    > Mitchell Kapor amid a civil liberties movement sparked in large   > part by the Secret Service computer crime crackdown.      ftp.eff.org   ===========      /pub/cud/papers/sundevil   ---     A collection of information on Operation SunDevil by the Epic     nonprofit publishing project.

ISDN is a high-speed data communications standard that utilizes   existing copper telephone lines, and is a possible inexpensive and   intermediate alternative to laying fiber optic cable for phone   networks.  The speeds involved may be sufficient for audio and   video transmission applications.  G.

FOOTNOTES =========   _____ <7.1> What is the background behind the Internet?     The article ``Internet'' in Fantasy and Science Fiction by Bruce   Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> contains general and nontechnical   introductory notes on origins of the Internet, including the role   of the RAND corporation, the goal of network resilience in face of   nuclear attack, MIT, UCLA, ARPANET, TCP/IP, NSF, NREN, etc.:    > ARPANET itself formally expired in 1989, a happy victim of its    > own overwhelming success.  Its users scarcely noticed, for   > ARPANET's  functions not only continued but steadily improved.    > The use of  TCP/IP standards for computer networking is now   > global.  In 1971, a  mere twenty-one years ago, there were only   > four nodes in the  ARPANET  network.  Today there are tens of   > thousands of  nodes in  the Internet,  scattered over forty-two   > countries, with more coming  on-line every day.

Last year the Internet was growing at   > a rate of  twenty percent a *month.*  The number of `host'   > machines with direct  connection to TCP/IP has been doubling   > every year since  1988.   The Internet is moving out of  its   > original base in military and  research institutions,  into   > elementary and high schools, as well as into  public libraries   > and the commercial sector.

It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takes a long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit.

It must be able to run Unix.          What are other questions that I should ask to ensure getting a     quality stuff? What are other important features ?   Monitor:     I want a 14\\\" non interlaced svga, but not sure about what brand     to get. I can't afford NEC or SONY. What brands should I consider?     Acer? Touch?      What else should I ask?  Video Card:      I would like to run Framemaker. So I need a fast video card. Is Western     Digital worth the $20 over Cirrus Logic?  Do I need more than 1M of      V-RAM?      One company wanted $50 more for a local bus video card. Is this normal?       Hard Drive:     Segate, Western Digital, Conner all have the same price. Which one is     more liable? which one has better performace?  Case/power supply:     Given the choise of desktop and minitower, which one is better?     What is the adequate power supply?     Is cooling a general problem or a non-issue?     What features should I ask for?      Did I miss anything?  I am sure that there are a lot of semi-PC-literates reading this group.

X X XGOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X    * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X XRULES: X X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules: X X    1) Your entry must be a complete program. X X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or } X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536. X X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format: X X---entry--- Xrule: 1993 Xfix: y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry) Xtitle: title of entry        (see comments below) Xentry: Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0) Xdate: Date/time of submission in UTC     (see comments below) Xhost: Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested X Use tab indented lines if needed X---remark--- X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author--- Xname: your name Xorg: School/Company/Organization Xaddr: postal address X use tab indented lines to continue X don't forget to include the country Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain. X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines. Xanon: y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info) X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X * The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X   and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X   It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X   incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X   consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X * The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X   to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()  X   using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X * You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X   it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the  X   ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same  X   title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be  X   sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X * With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above  X   format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X   something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X   Email message to the judges. X X * Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless  X   'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X * To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X   each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X   should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X * The entry's remarks should include: X     - what this program does X     - how to run the program (sample args or input) X     - special compile or execution instructions, if any X     - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X     - information about any ---data--- files X     - why you think the program is obfuscated X     - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X     - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X * Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X   portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They  X   should not be required to exist. X X   If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X   section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple  X   ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X   each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X    'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X    'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X        digit, followed by '.c' X    your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X        title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not  X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to: X X  ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate X  obfuscate@toad.com X X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'. X X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however. X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC. X X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry X       must be sent in a separate Email letter. X X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.   X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed. X X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user, X       special owner or group) are not allowed. X     X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    The Judging will be done by Landon Noll and Larry Bassel.

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers  X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with  X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor  X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X * look at the original source X * convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X * run it through a C beautifier X * examine the algorithm X * lint it X * compile it X * execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting \\\"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake\\\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X #define d define X #d foo     <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X int i; X j;     <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you  X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in  X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X int i; X char *c; X i[c];     <--- use c[i] instead X (i+3)[\\\"string\\\"];   <--- use \\\"string\\\"[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X * assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X * casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X * passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X * passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X * performing arithmetic on va_list variables X * using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X * are very hardware specific X * are very OS or Un*x version specific X      (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X       code is likely not to be) X * dump core or have compiler warnings X      (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X * won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X * abusing the build file to get around the size limit X * obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X * are longer than they need to be X * are similar to previous winners X * are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X * are as concise and small as they need to be X * do something at least quasi-interesting X * pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X * are portable X * are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X * MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X * make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X where this program differs from the contest rules, the X contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

If an entry wins, we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition, X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award, X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X * Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X * Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X  cc prog.c -o special_name  need special binary X X     or  rm -f special_src.c   need special source X  cp prog.c special_src.c X  cc special_src.c -o special_name X X     or  rm -f special_build   need special build X  tail +4 build > special_build X  sh < special_build X X * Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of  X   your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You  X   should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the  X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X     X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer  X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as  X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many  X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X date -u \\\"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\\\" X date -u | sed -e 's/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/' X sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X ---entry--- section X all ---author--- sections X all ---info--- sections X ---build--- section X ---program--- section X any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X * reading the ---entry--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X * passing the source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X * performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X * passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X * linting the source X * compiling/building the source X * running the program X * performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X * best small one line program X * best small program X * strangest/most creative source layout X * most useful obfuscated program X * best game that is obfuscated X * most creatively obfuscated program X * most deceptive C code X * best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X * best abuse of ANSI C X * worst abuse of the rules X * <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry  X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,  X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X     comp.lang.c    comp.unix.wizards alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X     comp.sources.d   alt.sources.d  misc.misc X     comp.sources.misc   comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners  X    have appeared in books (\\\"The New Hackers Dictionary\\\") and on T-Shirts. X X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-) X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X X    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.

Plus extras like hot showers, Tours, a Concourse  D'Elegance and more.     This is first time in the 49'er Rally's 20-year history that the   event is being held in Quincy.  And according to Pat Gardner, Rally Chairman,  \\\"The 49'er Rally's continuing growth and the need for a larger and more  complete facility led us to Quincy.

For pre-registration forms and additional information, write Doug  Hubbard, BMW Club of Northern California, 41236 Norman Court, Fremont, CA  94539, or telephone <US> (510) 651-2195   ADDITIONAL NOTES::     This is a not for profit event and riders DO get their monies worth.    Whether you've ever attended a rally before or not This is the one    to make.  The only problem has been that there are so    many activities that attendees have to choose one over another.     Quincy is a beautiful campground, lots of grass and little dust.    For folks who have been to previous 49'er rallies at Mariposa,     Quincy has lots of space, all of it flat so room is not a problem.    There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather.    Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us.     Registration will begin on thursday.  Of course there are always early    arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays    for camping Thursday through Monday (5 days).  There will be a tour Friday    with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the    awards ceremony.  \",\"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----        >So, don't just think of replacements for clipper, also think of front    >ends.

Come on, Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant. Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders.   YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**. Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.  But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel doesn't have a game like that in him.   Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about Roussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah, Dom has played well too.   FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a team picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the same picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning, Kasper...   Mostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain autographs on the team photos. I don't like that method since I've seen guards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they got their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies.\",\"Following a series of miscarriages, my wife was given a transfusion of my white cells. (The theory as I understand it is that there is some kind of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as it normally would a \\\"foreign\\\" body.

Originally I was inspired by the NAPLPS graphics standard (a summary of  which hit this group about 2 weeks ago).  Following up on software availability of NAPLPS supporting software I find that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being PP3 which runs soley on MSDOS machines leaving Mac and Amiga users to buy full commercial software if they want to try out the BBS (I know I wouldn't)  Next most interesting possibility is to port MGR to PC, Mac, Amiga. I know there is an old version of a Mac port on bellcore.com that doesn't work under System 7 But I can't seem to find the source anywhere to see if I can patch it.  Is there a color version of MGR for Linux?  I know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year but I misplaced it.  Does anyone on this group know if MGR as been ported to PC or Amiga ?

It *does* make a difference whether the speculation is well-founded or not.     Though this is a good point.  The one speculation is \\\"safer\\\", because it can be reversed.\",\"  I think you missed one of my points there.  It takes *more* than a great GM to win a stanley cup, even once.  Some of the guys on the list you gave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey- that is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better  than yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original post (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not the coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:   I think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved here which transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for  us to say, \\\"He should hire a different coach.\\\"  In fact, he has talked about doing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to  prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second round.  He needs to, as the papers say, \\\"get that monkey off his back.\\\" So it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all a little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will improve as a result.  I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how good of a GM he really is.   I may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussing it with you. \",\"   Is the so-called material world \\\"outside\\\" the Kingdom of God?

(other than wuarchive, umich,.. something off the beaten path??)\",\" (excerpts from posting on this topic)    (I've seen satellites at midnight - they're not only in twilight.) :o)    Now my comments:   I'd like to add that some of the \\\"protests\\\" do not come from a strictly  practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for  research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend, \\\"getting away from it all\\\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters  much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.   But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't  fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever -  like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch  commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,  truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.    To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage  of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at  8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it  if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could  be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that  as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,  even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. \",\"Sender:  Reply-To: harmons@gyro.WV.TEK.COM (Harmon Sommer) Distribution:  Organization: /usr/ens/etc/organization Keywords:     Unless they have been taught to \\\"neck rein\\\".

John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400% does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus, before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is.   The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a player who gets an out gets a \\\"negative probability\\\" in most cases. Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes, they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also, the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given them a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.       No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score  in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The offence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.           No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look, if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers, fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \\\"negative chance\\\" that the team would win.   From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda. At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really does not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens. So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to player performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15% on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%. I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.  How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's, etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more valuble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better  pitcher?  They were probably about the
