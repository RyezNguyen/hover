If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger    economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a    lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,    but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing    military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than    just a \\\"we have the money, why not?\\\" approach.  Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European cooperation.  Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of money (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at the size of that multiplier :->).\",\"      1.

Look at the whole picture, not just randomly picked libertarian positions.  If government is not allowed to use \\\"non-initiated force\\\" to achieve its goals, than no special interest can influence the government to use non-initiated force on their behalf.  The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic which I'll address briefly.  It certainly won't happen until libertarianism is the dominate philosophy.  What means do we have to make libertarianism the dominate philosophy?  Statists run the education monopoly, so we have to be creative.  The Advocates for Self-Government reports 85% of their Seminar 1 participants \\\"embrace\\\" libertarianism. That's the best means I've seen yet.

A few weeks ago, she noticed that some of her hair was starting to fall out.  She would touch her head and strands of hair would just fall right out. (by the way, she is 29 or 30 years old).   It continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the size of a half dollar.  Since that time, she  has gotten two more bald spots of the same size.  Other symptoms she's described include:  several months of an irregular menstrual cycle (which is strange for her, because she has always been extremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wake up one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next day it's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or 5 very bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one that knocked her to the ground; and general fatigue.  She went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reason for the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected thyroid problems.  He did the blood work and claims that everything came back normal.    She's very concerned and very confused.  Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions?  I told her that I thought she should see an endocrinologist.  Does that sound like the right idea?  ** By the way, in case you are going to ask...no, she has recently taken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no, she hasn't recently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm,  coloring, or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall out.\",\"  Krillean photography involves taking pictures of minute decapods resident in  the seas surrounding the antarctic.

Alan\",\" I finished reading a very good book, \\\"The Will of God\\\", Weatherhead. This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the will of God.  Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts; intentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He (Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael Parkin above quite nicely.  Summarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, God's ultimate will is never to be defeated.  God's intentions may be interfered with, even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by circumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all humankind) will never be stopped.  Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of this process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God's intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and deviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3) Despite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in the Cross, as Jesus willingly (\\\"not my will, Lord, but yours\\\") died for the redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant, overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances.   It was not the intentional will of God.  It was the circumstancial will, thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will.    Right, intentional will.  (Just like the Jewish people  We know neither the time nor the place.

It is an S3 86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my second meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from them, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say \\\"Buy the memory from us\\\" or something like that.)   The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a 1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256. Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I asked them why, and all I got was \\\"Your point is well taken, but Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects.\\\"   So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805 drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're broken.   If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805 cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are \\\"less busy\\\".

There are a miriad of factors for  each individual. As we are all different, we quite obviously require  different levels of evidence.   As one pointed out, one's history is important. While in FUSSR, one  may not believe a comrade who states that he owns five pairs of blue jeans.  One would need more evidence, than if one lived in the United States. The  only time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the US, is if the  individual always wear business suits, etc.   The degree of the effect upon the world, and the strength of the  claim also determine the amount of evidence necessary. When determining the  level of evidence one needs, it is most certainly relevent what the  consequences of the proposition are.     If the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, please explain  why one would not accept: The electro-magnetic force of attraction between  two charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their  distance apart.    Remember, if the consequences of the law are not relevent, then we can not use experimental evidence as a disproof. If one of the  consequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of  affairs, or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law,  they are irrelevent when theorizing about the \\\"Truth\\\" of the law.   Given that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, including  the consequence of self-contradiction or contradiction with the state of  affiars, how are we ever able to  judge what is true or not; let alone find \\\"The Truth\\\"?

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the system key   2) Recieve Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number      is necessary for local operation).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large, making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.  IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number.\",\"  Gifts of the Spirit should not be seen as an endorsement of ones behavior. A lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs.  Jesus said that people would come to Him saying \\\"Lord, Lord,\\\" and proclaiming the miraculous works they had done in His name.  Jesus would tell them that they were workers of iniquity that do not know Him, and to depart from Him.    That is not to say that this will happen to everyone who commits a homosexual sin.  If the Holy Spirit were only given to the morally perfect, He would not be given to me, or any of us.  God can forgive any sin, if we repent. But people should be careful not to think, \\\"God has given me a gift of the Spirit, it must be okay to be gay.\\\"  That is dangerous (see also hebrews 6 about those who have partaken of the Holy Spirit and of the powers of  the world to come.)   Jesus doesn't ask us to change our own nature.  We cannot lift ourselves out of our own sin- but we must submit to His hand as He changes our nature.  Practicing homosexual acts and homosexual lusts violates the morality that God has set forth.    If you don't believe that, and think those of us who do are just ignorant, then at least consider us weak in the faith and be celebate for our sake's. Is practicing homosexuality worth the cost of a soul, whether it be the homosexual's or the one considered \\\"ignorant?\\\"\",\"  My, this distinction seems quite arbitrary.    Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered.   (Ps. 32:1).  and quoted by the apostle Paul:    Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God   imputeth righteousness without works,   Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins   are covered.   Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  (Rom. 4:6-8)  The biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are parallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments.  The dispensational distinction is unwarranted.   I'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  You're suggesting Jesus is going to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- for millions perhaps billions of people.  Such activity for Moses the lawgiver was considered unwise (cf. Ex. 18:13ff).  It makes for interesting speculation, though.  I'll leave comments on the so-called \\\"bema seat\\\" vs. \\\"throne\\\" judgments to someone else.

[Quotations omitted.  This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]  There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the \\\"Annunciation\\\" by Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28   And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto  a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a  man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's  name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\\\"Hail,  thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed  art thou among women.\\\"_  Now, now, hold that line of thought - \\\"the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women\\\" - while you read on....  In the book, \\\"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of Devotion to Mary\\\" by Peter Lappin:  The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible that the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title \\\"The Conception of Saint Anne\\\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary is the incorruptible timber \\\"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christ's sinless body\\\"; she is \\\"God's Eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\\\"  Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus, she was hailed as \\\"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\\\". ... At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a  greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_. ...  Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. From \\\"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\\\" by John A. Hardon:  Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism. Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).  Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall: In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over: -They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the  power to think and to choose freely. -The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality  and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. -They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,  the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding  title to enter heaven. By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely.  Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day...  Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ (I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):  Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born  AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was: \\\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst women\\\".  Even Mary was confused about this greeting.  Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (Adam and Eve before their sin):     Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)     Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)     The Lord is with you (At those times, God would                 definitely want to be with those He                 has made _blessed_)     Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)  At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body of Christ and so,  Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart. \",\"   It seemed pretty conclusive to me.  The puck clearly hit the crossbar and then came down on the line.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.       WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE      Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     \\\"scooped\\\" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study, Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:         Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year    Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year    Shuttle sources:   725,000 kilograms/year      The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.      Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space     Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR     Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W. Ko and N.D.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \\\"the bends\\\", certainly some     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,     you're dying. The limits are not really known.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School     of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.       HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED      The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin     team's medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team     examined them, they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE \\\"FACE ON MARS\\\"      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

Note that this is very much like the language used in many gun control bills/laws the Administration is pushing for, or otherwise supporting. The logic and actual rationale (as opposed to the excuses that get fed to the media) is the same in both cases, only the items or technology in question are different.  I think this is no accident.  It comes from the same philosophy that the government rules/controls the people, not the people controlling the government, that the unconnected citizens are not sophisticated enough to know what is best for them, so the government must tell the people what they need or do not need ... \\\"we know best...\\\".  And the idea that that a commoner can defend himself against government eavesdropping or unlawful attack is totally unacceptable to people with this outlook.   Combine this all with pushing for national identity cards with 'smart chips' to encode anything they please (internal passport) under the guise of streamlining the State People's Health Care System, and with (you can be certain) more jewels yet to come, and one sees an extremely ominous trend.

SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it. There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and the software.  THAT IS IT. Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.  SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}  asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}  synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a  rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}  SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from  SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs  this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers  AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the   slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode   4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous  mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}  SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things  over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the  machine and the external device.  Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver  software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.  Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.  SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this  requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING  devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.

Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made obsolete by Jesus.  If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, He also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived interpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their heads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom of Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin. They had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the letter of the Law but never really believed in it.    I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?  Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will. Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.

That is--you get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree    to escrow your key. Otherwise you are on your own.  That's the disturbing part - use of other products IS voluntary, for now, and the press releases talk about the White House's unwillingness to decide that citizens have a right to good commercial crypto gear, and about how commercial alternatives will be permitted as long as they provide key escrow services.  That's a clear implication that they're considering banning alternatives.  Additionally, use of real alternatives ISN'T totally legal - you're not allowed to export really good crypto equipment except to the government's friends (e.g. the Australian government) you can only export even BAD crypto equipment with their permission, and the regulators who control the cellular telephone companies make sure there are only two competitors, so Joe's Garage Cellular can't start offering a secure service.  \",\"Heise model 710A pressure meter.

A while ago, I read an interesting book by a fellow called Von Daenicken, in which he proved some of the wildest things, and on the last page, he wrote something like \\\"Can you prove it isn't so?\\\" I certainly can't, but I'm not going to believe him, because he based his \\\"proof\\\" on some really questionable stuff, such as old myths (he called it \\\"circumstancial evidence\\\" :] ).

Many of the predecessors of Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more.  I don't think \\\"extra-scientific\\\" is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational is a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.  For example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a friend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but Pasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking at the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.  Again, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers (tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the \\\"Newton of mirror-image life,\\\" which he never admitted publically.  Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery started this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile and Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice. Most of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the student.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which the student eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the research program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery (Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\",\"Just to shed some light on the fire, it was widely reported (AP, etc.) that there WERE several witnesses to BD folks starting the fires.

Especially when it  comes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer.  As a long time Red Sox fan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you with short memories. short lives, or both.

This statement is supported based on the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a  team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.    Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans supported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of  detracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what  happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly  not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all, remember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that far, let alone beat Baltimore.  Let's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football and Basketball.

Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production( toxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well  because of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got  into Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium  would prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here. But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6  supplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).  Vitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams  per day).   1. Review Article \\\"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney      stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\\\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.     5(3):110-129(1985).  But glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both  glycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this  production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine,  but to increase your intake of vitamin B6.   2. \\\"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in       patients with kidney stones\\\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)      200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary       excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.   3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\\\" Clin. Sci. 38     :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day      showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.  For gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is  required for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for  oxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is  quite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.   The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40%  of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable  and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto  6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic  acid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the  extra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a  very early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.  Med. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day  increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg  per day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was  increased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose  and 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion  before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average  before supplementation.  B6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There  are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about  yet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the  speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must  have an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then  explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C  challenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your  intake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you  take vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient  in B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate  kidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets  absorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day  showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309 -15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase  in urinary oxalate excretion.   Here are the high oxalate foods:   1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.     Contain at least 25mg/100grams   2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale,      peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.     Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.  If the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot  of latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points  out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your  intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being  absorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn't  have to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for  males and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake). B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more  per day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).    The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day  for males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with  this low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6  requirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that  either block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6  excretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol, isoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to  supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that  increase the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking  birth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the  other drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your  dietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone  formation should be given B6 supplements.  One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your  Ca/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is  calcium-oxalate.   4. \\\"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of  patients with calcium oxalate calculi\\\"Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)   5. \\\"Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the  crystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium  interaction\\\"J. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990).   6.Review Article, \\\"Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment  of renal calcium stones\\\" J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).  There are actually about three times as many articles published in the  medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone  formation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in  stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier  post in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I  guess that he doesn't read the medical literature.  Oh well, since kidney  stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them, I thought  I'd tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor's office.

What  was he killed for. He hadn't hurt anyone, hadn't said any word he oughtn't  have. Why did they kill him? I want to find out--from here, from there, from  the government--why my husband was killed.  On the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home. He doesn't work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, \\\"Mamma, is  there a soccer game?\\\" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That's where we  lived. I say, \\\"I don't know, Igor, I haven't turned on the TV.\\\" He looked  again and said, \\\"Mamma, what's going on in the courtyard?!\\\" I look and see so  many people, it's awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands,  you can't even tell how many there are. They're shouting, \\\"Down with the  Armenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!\\\" My God, why is  that happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together well, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely  unexpected. And they were shouting, \\\"Long live Turkey!\\\" And they had flags, and they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he's  around 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I  can't make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something, and the children behind him are shouting, \\\"Tear the Armenians to pieces!\\\" and  \\\"Down with the Armenians!\\\" They shout it again, and then shout, \\\"Hurrah!\\\" The  people streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I  saw that there were women, too. I say, \\\"My God, there are women there too!\\\"  And my son says, \\\"Those aren't women, Mamma, those are bad women.\\\" Well we  didn't look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I  simply couldn't sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani  neighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \\\"Khalida, what's going on, what  happened?\\\" She says, \\\"Emma, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what  happened.\\\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks,  each second or third one had a white rod. They're waving the rods above their  heads as they walk, and the one who's out front, like a leader, he has a white stick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I  don't know.  My husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \\\"Oh  dear, I'm frightened, they're going to kill us I bet.\\\" And he says, \\\"What are  you afraid of, they're just children.\\\" I say, \\\"Everything that happens comes  from children.\\\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and  Vocational School. \\\"Don't fear,\\\" he said, \\\"it's nothing, nothing all that  bad.\\\" He didn't eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they broadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran.  When I heard that I couldn't settle down at all, I kept walking here and  there and I said, \\\"They're going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to  kill us.\\\" And he says, \\\"Don't be afraid.\\\" Then we heard--from the central  square, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shouting different things, and you couldn't hear every well. I say, \\\"You speak Azerbaijani well, listen to what they're saying.\\\" He says \\\"Close the window and go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\\\" He listened a bit and then  closed the window and went to bed, and told us, \\\"Come on, go to sleep, it's nothing.\\\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window until two in the morning watching. Well he's sick, and all of this was affecting him. I say, \\\"Igor, you go to bed, I'm going to go to bed in a minute too.\\\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed.  Things had calmed down slightly.  The 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \\\"Come on, Emma,  get up.\\\" I say, \\\"Today's my day off, let me rest.\\\" He says, \\\"Aren't you going  to make me some tea?\\\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \\\"Where are  you going?\\\" He says, \\\"I'm going out, I have to.\\\" I say, \\\"Can you really go  outside on a day like today? Don't go out, for God's sake. You never listen to me, I know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take  the car out of the garage, go without the car.\\\" And he says, \\\"Come on, close  the door!\\\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn't make it out, he probably said \\\"coward\\\" or something.  I closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up around the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after- noon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said, \\\"Khalida, was it our car?\\\" She says, \\\"No, no, Emma, don't be afraid, they were government cars and Zhigulis.'' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited, it was four o'clock, five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven I said, \\\"Oh, they've killed Shagen!\\\"  Tires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and I'm afraid, I'm  standing on the balcony and I'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God,  they've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten  o'clock and he still hadn't come home. And I'm afraid to go out. At ten o'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore, and from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside.  I'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I  don't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see  it. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \\\"Mamma,\\\" he says, \\\"look what they're doing over there!\\\" They were burning everything, and there  were police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing  on the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are  throwing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony  is shouting, \\\"What are you standing there for, burn it!\\\" When they threw the  television, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out  on her balcony and shouted, \\\"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those things, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their  home. Why are you burning them?\\\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \\\"Go  inside, go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in  your building or not?\\\" They meant Armenians, but they didn't say Armenians,  they said, \\\"of them.\\\" She says, \\\"No, no, no, none!\\\" Then she ran downstairs to our place, and says, \\\"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\\\" I say, \\\"They've killed Shagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won't be living for me without  Shagen. Let them kill us, too!\\\" She insists, saying, \\\"Emma, get out of here,  go to Khalida's, and give me the key. When they come I'll say that it's my  daughter's apartment, that they're off visiting someone.\\\" I gave her the key  and went to the neighbor's, but I couldn't endure it. I say, \\\"Igor, you stay  here, I'm going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa's . . . Papa's there.\\\"  Meanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and  Valery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in  the courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling,  and I didn't think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived in the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw an Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \\\"Madar,  Uncle Shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the  garage, let's at least bring the corpse into the house. \\\"He shouts, \\\"Aunt  Emma, where do you think you're going?! Go back into the house, I'll look for  him.\\\" I say, \\\"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar,  I'm coming too.\\\" Well he wouldn't let me go all the same, he says, \\\"You stay  here with us, I'm go look.\\\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \\\"Aunt  Emma, there's no one there, the garage is closed. \\\"Madar went off again and  then returned and said, \\\"Aunt Emma, they're already killed Alik, and Valery's  there . . . wheezing.\\\"  Madar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \\\"Don't go near him,  or we'll put you next to him.\\\" He got scared--he's young--and came back and  said, \\\"I'm going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take  Alik, maybe he'll live . . . \\\" They grew up together in our courtyard, they  knew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but not a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and  called, and called, and called--nothing.  I went upstairs to the neighbor's. Igor says, \\\"Two police cars drove up over  there, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still  lying where they were, they're still lying there . . . \\\"We watched out the window until four o'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn't take my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six o'clock in the morning I got up and said, \\\"Igor, you stay here at home, don't go out, don't go anywhere, I'm going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or alive . . . let me go . . . I've got the keys from work.\\\"  At six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another  doctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \\\"Doctor, is  Shagen there?\\\" He says, \\\"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\\\" I  wanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. There were only four people in there, they said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. They said, \\\"Shagen's not here, he's alive somewhere, he'll come back.\\\"  It's already seven o'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck with three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with them. I say, \\\"Sara Baji [\\\"Sister\\\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they've probably brought Shagen.\\\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back and says, \\\"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it's a younger person.\\\" Now Shagen  just happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they  said it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \\\"Doctor, they've  brought Shagen in dead.\\\" He says, \\\"Why are you carrying on like that, dead,  dead . . . he's alive.\\\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back  the look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They knew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \\\"Doctor,  is it Shagen?\\\" He says, \\\"No, Emma, it's not he, it's somebody else entirely.\\\"  I say, \\\"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I'll find out all the same anyway,  if not today, then tomorrow.\\\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the office. He says, \\\"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\\\" Another one of our  colleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous  condition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't Shagen. A few minutes  later another colleague comes in and says, \\\"Oh, poor Emma!\\\" When she said it  like that there was no hope left.     That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured  people.  At night someone took me home. I said, \\\"Igor, Papa's been killed.\\\"  On the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital:  I had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is  surrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \\\"Hey, citizen, where  are you going?\\\" I say, \\\"I work here,\\\" and from inside someone shouts, \\\"Yes,  yes, that's our cook, let her in.\\\" I went right to the head doctor's office and there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to work with us at the hospital. He says, \\\"Emma, Shagen's been taken to Baku. In the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\\\" I say, \\\"Doctor, how will I bury him?\\\" He says, \\\"We're taking care of all that, don't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. Where did you spend the night?\\\" I say, \\\"I was at home.\\\" He says, \\\"What do you mean you were at home?! You were at home alone?\\\" I say, \\\"No, Igor was there too.\\\" He says, \\\"You can't stay home, we're getting an ambulance right now, wait just one second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance right now, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here like a patient, and you'll stay here and we'll se~ later what to do next ...\\\" His last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor's name is Izyat Jamalogli Sadukhov.  The \\\"ambulance\\\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a  patient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the  hospital until the 4th.  Some police car came and they said, \\\"Emma, let's go.\\\" And the women, our  colleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \\\"Where are  you taking her?\\\" I say, \\\"They're going to kill me, too . . . \\\" And the investigator says, \\\"Why are you saying that, we're going to make a positive identification.\\\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I still can't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \\\"Let's  go, we need to be certain, maybe it's not Shagen.\\\" And when I saw the caskets, lying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \\\"I can't look, no.\\\" The investigator says, \\\"Are there any identifying marks?\\\" I say, \\\"Let me see the clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I'll recognize them.\\\" He says,  \\\"Isn't they're anything on his body?\\\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his  finger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had been injured at work . . .  They brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they  brought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \\\"Oh,  they burned him!\\\" I shouted, I don't know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat  down, I don't remember. And that investigator says, \\\"Well fine, fine, since  we've identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since he has seven gold teeth . . . \\\"  On the 4th they told me: \\\"Emma, it's time to bury Shagen now.\\\" I cried, \\\"How,  how can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he's sick? I should inform  his relatives, he has three sisters, I can't do it by myself.\\\" They say, \\\"OK,  you know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they  get here from Yerevan? There's no transportation, it s impossible.\\\"  He was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in  Sumgait. They asked me, \\\"Where do you want to bury him?\\\" I said, \\\"I want to  bury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\\\" I'm  shouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \\\"Do you know what  it means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\\\" I say, \\\"What do you mean,  arson? Don't they know what's going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that they killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don't have anyone  anymore.\\\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He says, \\\"Let's bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year,  if it calms down, I'll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \\\"  Our trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the investigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then at the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime.  Then they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said,  \\\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\\\" He says, \\\"Yes.\\\" \\\"Well look, here you're  describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\\\" He says,  \\\"Yes.\\\" \\\"And now you're telling it differently?\\\" He says, \\\"Well maybe I  forgot!\\\" Like that.  The witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going along Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a  Volga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were  involved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it's unclear who--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side of the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports  jacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \\\"What's your nationality?\\\" He  says, \\\"Armenian.\\\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \\\"If he's an Armenian, kill him, kill him!\\\" They started beating him, they broke seven of his ribs, and his heart . . . I don't know, they did something there, too  . . . it's too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he  had an armature shaft. He says, \\\"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush,  that's where I got it.\\\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he had already had it. He said, \\\"I hit him twice,\\\" he said, \\\" . . . once or twice on the head with that rod.\\\" And he said that when he started to beat him  Shagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said,  \\\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment, killing someone,\\\" he says, \\\"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or not?\\\" I said, \\\"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you came back to hit him again?\\\" He went back and looked and he was already dead. \\\"After that,\\\" that bastard Tale said, \\\"after that I went home.\\\"  I said, \\\"You . . . you . . . little snake,\\\" I said, \\\"Are you a thief and a  murderer?\\\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They were taken. He says he didn't take them  When they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was other people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned it, that hasn't been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \\\"How can you  have the trial when you don't know who burned the car?\\\" He said something, but I didn't get what he was saying. But I said, \\\"You still haven't straightened  everything out, I think that's unjust.\\\"  When they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him.  In the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80 percent of his body . . .  And I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good  craftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his  own hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the  time. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the  Army. And now they're fatherless...  I couldn't sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15 years' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn't know what to do with myself, I said, \\\"How can that be? You,\\\" I said, \\\"you are  saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years'  deprivation of freedom?\\\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \\\"Let me at that creep, with my bare hands I'll . . . \\\" A relative restrained me, and there were all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,\\\" This isn't a  Soviet trial, this is unjust!\\\" That's what I shouted, l said it and left . . .  I said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street,  they were shouting, \\\"Long live Turkey!\\\" and \\\"Glory to Turkey!\\\" And during the  trial I said to that Ismailov, \\\"What does that mean, 'Glory to Turkey'?\\\" I  still don't understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet  Union. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still don't understand why \\\"Glory to Turkey!\\\" I asked that question twice and got no answer . . . No one answered me . . .

SUG's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible service and value-added to our members.  Last year, the SUG 1991 disk contained plug-and-play X11R4, 20MB of additional essential binaries, almost 200MB of Sun patches, fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net postings, priced at only $250.  Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be produced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added as possible.  To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk set, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the second available later in '92, containing more SPARC binaries and other useful material not found on previous disks.  The SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce, contains a lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great service to make it available right away to our members (and this pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a SUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live within the US or $55 outside.  The SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used by PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a total of 543MB of material, including:  X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after the initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0 distribution are included (109MB of material).

Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that  black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars, M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking appoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time, they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any of these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of the galaxy.           Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the various satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either Pion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our catalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic distribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of homogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE. Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I suppose you are saying, \\\"Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the disk.\\\"  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an  analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile away sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different, and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe find a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.           I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As I said before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short timescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of behavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources. When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk, but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources  in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of these characteristics.  \",\"  Not necessarily.  It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence. There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and Alomar is not a home run hitter.   Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.  Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.  Regarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players with different strengths and a bright future. \",\"}start her up and rev to about 3000 rpm....I FAIL cuz I register 120 DB, }and the max allowed is 110!

(A WD/Paradise) \",\"Ten Questions about arab countries ----------------------------------  I would be thankful if any of you who live in arab countries could help to provide accurate answers to the following specific questions. These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me.  1.      Is it true that many arab countries don't recognize Israeli nationality ?  That people with Israeli stamps on their passports can't enter arabic countries?  2.      Is it true that arabic countries such as Jordan and Syria have undefined borders and that arab governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of their states should be?  3.      Is it true that arab countires refused to sign the Chemical weapon convention treaty in Paris in 1993?  4.      Is it true that in arab prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ?  4a. Is it true that some arab countries, like Syria, harbor Nazi war criminals, and refuse to extradite them?  4b. Is it true that some arab countries, like Saudi Arabia, prohibit women from driving cars?  5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the Muslim countries are subject to different laws than Muslims?  6.      Is it true that arab countries confiscated the property of entire Jewish communites forced to flee by anti-Jewish riots?  7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed a chemical weapons treaty that no arab nation was willing to sign?  8.      Is it true that Syrian Jews are required to leave a $10,000 deposit before leaving the country, and are no longer allowed to emmigrate, despite promises made by Hafez Assad to George Bush?  9.  Is it true that Jews in Muslim lands are required to pay a special tax, for being Jews?  10.     Is it true that Intercontinental Hotel in Jerusalem was built on a Jewish cemetary, with roads being paved over grave sites, and gravestones being used in Jordanian latrines?  11. Is it really cheesy and inappropriate to post lists of biased leading questions?  11a. Is it less appropriate if information implied in Mr. Davidsson's questions is highly misleading?

In addition, the proceeds from the sale (especially by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait U.A.E. etc) are disproportionately reinvested in the U.S. and G.B.,  propping up these economies and further providing an incentive  to keep prices from falling too low.\",\"Scoring stats for the Swedish NHL players, April 5:  ===================================================   Mats Sundin watch:     Most points during a season:       131  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1980-81  (49+82)     110  Mats Naslund, Montreal Canadiens   1985-86  (43+67)   * 109  Mats Sundin, Quebec Nordiques      1992-93  (43+66)     106  Hakan Loob, Calgary Flames         1987-88  (50+56)     104  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1982-83  (46+58)      99  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1984-85  (37+62)     Most goals during a season:       50  Hakan Loob, Calgary Flames         1987-88      49  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1980-81      46  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1982-83      45  Tomas Sandstrom, LA Kings          1990-91      43  Mats Naslund, Montreal Canadiens   1985-86   *  43  Mats Sundin, Quebec Nordiques      1992-93     Most assists during a season:       82  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1980-81      67  Mats Naslund, Montreal Canadiens   1985-86      66  Borje Salming, Toronto Maple Leafs 1976-77   *  66  Mats Sundin, Quebec Nordiques      1992-93      62  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1984-85      61  Borje Salming, Toronto Maple Leafs 1977-78      61  Thomas Steen, Winnipeg Jets        1988-89   Ulf Samuelsson watch:     Most penalty minutes during a season:    *  243  Ulf Samuelsson, Pittsburgh Penguins   1992-93   (through 3/25)      211  Ulf Samuelsson, Pittsburgh Penguins   1990-91      206  Ulf Samuelsson, Pittsburgh Penguins   1991-92      184  Kjell Samuelsson, Philadelphia Flyers 1988-89      181  Ulf Samuelsson, Hartford Whalers      1988-89      174  Ulf Samuelsson, Hartford Whalers      1985-86      170  Borje Salming, Toronto Maple Leafs    1980-81   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  RL Rk Name             Team J# Ps Ht   Wt  Born      G  A  Pts  PL  Comment -- -- ---------------- ---- -- -- ---  --- --------  -- -- ---  --  -------     1 Mats Sundin       QUE 13 C  6-2  189  2/13/71  43 66 109   7       2 Ulf Dahlen        MIN 22 RW 6-2  195  1/12/67  33 38  71   5         3 Thomas Steen      WIN 25 C  5-10 195  6/ 8/60  21 43  64   5     4 Johan Garpenlov   SJS 10 LW 5-11 185  3/21/68  21 40  61   5      5 Fredrik Olausson  WIN  4 D  6-2  200 10/ 5/66  13 38  51   4     6 Tomas Sandstrom   LAK  7 LW 6-2  207  9/ 4/64  22 24  46   2     7 Per-Erik Eklund   PHI  9 LW 5-10 175  3/22/63   8 34  42      Injured     8 Calle Johansson   WAS  6 D  5-11 205  2/14/67   6 35  41   1     9 Nicklas Lidstrom  DET  5 D  6-2  180  4/28/70   7 33  40   2     10 Tommy Sjodin      MIN 33 D  5-11 190  8/13/65   7 29  36         11 Ulf Samuelsson    PIT  5 D  6-1  195  3/26/64   2 24  26   1     12 Mikael Andersson  TBL 34 LW 5-11 185  5/10/66  13 11  24   1     13 Michael Nylander  HFD 36 LW 5-11 176 10/ 3/72   5 16  21   2     14 Roger Johansson   CGY 34 D  6-1  185  4/ 7/67   4 15  19   1    15 Jan Erixon        NYR 20 LW 6-0  196  7/ 8/62   5 10  15          16 Peter Andersson   NYR 25 D  6-0  187  8/29/65   4  7  11   1     17 Kjell Samuelsson  PIT 28 D  6-6  235 10/18/58   3  6   9   2     18 Tommy Albelin     NJD  6 D  6-1  190  5/21/64   1  5   6          19 Per Djoos         NYR 44 D  5-11 176  5/11/68   1  1   2      Binghampton?

This is weird since the Orchid supposedly should be much faster (and I was told by someone that it can do almost 16 kb/s), since the VGA chip is covered by the Orchid label, I can't really tell for sure if it uses a 5286 chip, but the spec. sheet that comes with the board (no docs!) did say it has 1 meg dram and uses a 5286 chip. Winmarks (3.11) is about 4 mil. slower than a Viper (34 vs ~38) using standard palette.

In normal condition, the concentration of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid is about  2 uM that is high enough to activate one type of glutamate receptor-the NMDA receptor. But the question is Neuron and glial cell in the brain have a lots of transport to get glutamate into Neuron or glial. So no one know exact concentration of glutamate is around neurons. \",\" I don't know if this is still true, but at one time Coca-Cola took elaborate measures to keep the formula secret.  For instance, several plants in different cities each made one of six partial concentrates, which were then shipped back-and forth and remixed in a complicated scheme so that no single plant made the whole formula.

Guy didn't hit a lick, had negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield, now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime, he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't  know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field, he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important) was a absolute-primo-dick.    Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.    Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks  (Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been  a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.    You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers, simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you  blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one,  the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should  HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.  Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.    Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?    Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a  good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early 80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer :-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.  Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real stiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory, and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as SS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.    Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a \\\"mediot\\\"  candidate, pushed because of his \\\"winning attitude\\\" (a minor factor, if one at all), and his \\\"great defense\\\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.  SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris' \\\"ability to win\\\" which is nothing more than Morris' \\\"ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\\\".  At this point, Morris is an average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned  close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but not favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF \\\"consideration\\\".    Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about \\\"Yount and Smith being shortstops who  hung around a long time\\\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's  just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre... (Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)  Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY  tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the league.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.   This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it  or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project.\",\"Jason Kratz writing:  ...

So far, no takers. Personally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays, or at least been among the leaders.   Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just one base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.   Wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed. The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays. Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years.   Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances. The Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls in the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great on defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first.   Wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on defense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers some runs.  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average. I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw seem to have come out of theirs.\",\"[followups to talk.politics.guns]  rl> Russell Lawrence kr> Karl Rominger  kr> I support the right of any citizen with out a criminal history to own and     use firearms, regardless of race, gender, and RELIGION.  rl> Thanks for admitting that you, yourself, adhere to an illogical dogma.

Maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted  posts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared private key.  For example at the coming up Cypherpunks meeting, a private key corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out by a moderator.

Communiques intended by the group for non-attendees could of course just be signed using the private key but otherwises not encrypted.  Starting a alt.encrypted newsgroup rather than just maintaining mailing lists is better for several reasons.  First, it would be easier to archive for people who might join a group \\\"late\\\" and who might like to easily read earlier posts; second, traffic analysis to know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled; three, a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicize available privacy measures on the internet.

OK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  They need a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, they now need to      (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of        the key.  Now, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses? Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  State and lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics, while potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost, statutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderately clever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying new phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolen ones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting without a dialing license?]  There's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house,  how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enough safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and  it might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved,  how is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type chip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal Government, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic of the projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of  these kinds of problems will be open for public or \\\"expert\\\" scrutiny?]    Furthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around,  even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be  an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a  key, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political  embarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:      (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and        turns the results over to the NY State Police.  But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton Aid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf war going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case. Now, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have an extra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as another bargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.

Here is a reply to one of the letters.  Seems to me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell!]    Your using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course, in your termonology, God could not \\\"cease to exist.\\\"  However, that is not what death ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see that it signifies \\\"separation.\\\"  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is the reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one member of the Godhead was separated from the other two.    I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived.  She was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my \\\"girlfriend\\\" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were separated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided that she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was death.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not because He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go there.      When I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued on my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and unloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us do as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh.  You have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.     This may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.  Jesus most certainly felt the \\\"pinpricks\\\" of life.  As the Scripture say:  Heb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.  The kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes when He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  \\\"The Consciousness of Christ.\\\"  I have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study, including clh.    It is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually suffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we do.  He \\\"grew in knowledge.\\\"  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose to be taught.  It is my understanding that He was \\\"led of the Spirit\\\" to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and Jesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him, the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise.  That is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was living sequential history as you or I.    Maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not.   I was once a member of that club.  THe \\\"free thinker\\\" is a glorious ideal.  By contrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right.  But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his \\\"rational doubt\\\" when in fact he was led to it by his \\\"faith\\\".  He must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a \\\"free thinker\\\" to criticize the Christian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize him as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.  Pascal pointed out that \\\"sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.  Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.\\\"  The fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms, hence the term \\\"a\\\"-theist.  Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember.  However, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word, every point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.  That is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out \\\"Look, your fly is undone!\\\"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity.  The answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on presuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral.  In other words, another myth.    Presuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence.   Of course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first \\\"Highlander\\\" movie.  But again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of God.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His prophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you are to reject God's annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct understanding of Himself.\",\"I ordered an Intrepid ES on Jan 25th and haven't seen it yet.

Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start azathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.

Years ago in another time and place, I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive engines.  In many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray under the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various floation chambers on each side.  And if you *did* get something there, you'd spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again.  So we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out the dipstick hole.  There was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designed to fit down the dipstick tube, and another, thicker/shorter hose on the outlet side that you put into any convenient container.  I'm sure these gadgets are still available from marine hardware suppliers if you want one.\",\" I wish I could agree with you.  Ask yourself this.  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least partially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly evaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released) The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't.  There is other hardware out there not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)  My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper systems.  If not we're in trouble.  Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like to think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this. They know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken seriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step in the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the \\\"Clipper\\\" system is easily justified \\\"Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying to subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever.\\\" How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system the only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administration knows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for drug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.  Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid. Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations collective I.Q. is about that of a potato.  Why do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big, and NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the stuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why the hell would they jump the gun?   I really wonder.  To wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:  The White House Office of the Press Secretary c/o: Presidential Comment Line (fax) (202) 456-2461   April 17, 1993   Sir and/or Madam:     I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and cryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.   It is apparent to me that those who drafted the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \\\"Big Brother Proposal\\\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep      ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \\\"experts\\\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.   In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \\\"tamper proof\\\" the key escrows might be.   I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti      lize the \\\"Big Brother Chip.\\\"   Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \\\"harmony,\\\" \\\"right to encryption,\\\" and \\\"voluntary.\\\"   It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \\\"I can't believe it's happening here.\\\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \\\"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\\\"           Most Concerned,         [Signature]       Shaen Logan Bernhardt I uni@acs.bu.edu \",\" this borders on blasphemy.\",\"  But what is Hasan B.

By trying to inject the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without adding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could be \\\"Is a polydactyl person a human being?\\\"  You still have not answered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.   You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies. If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule, provide it for me.   More irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does not follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out, brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights of the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant difference.  What I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the thread you started?  You got answers to your questions when you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected, changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion of substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance, why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss silly accussations, e.g. \\\"It really doesn't matter to you...\\\" If it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek some substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic and show some meaning to your words.   As others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on which has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy fails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here. A woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would not be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?   Is it?  Please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.   You simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is not accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on for size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments. But the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The systems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.   Your argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total failure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in reality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible, that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said, you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said, there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to its claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?   You haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.   Again you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and it is not as slow as you seem to think.   Yes, and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that he was murdered by a religious, \\\"pro-life\\\" fanatic.  Please do try to stay relevant.   Clever comeback.  I congratulate you on the readiness of your wit.  What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake? Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What is different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction anyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at parties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.\",\"Ahhh, remember the days of Yesterday?

(now what does require some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation of what's out there....) But there is NO evidence - pro or con - for the existence or non-existence of God (see what I have to say below on this).   Sorry if I remain skeptical - I don't believe it's entirely a conclusion. That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God is correct - neither have I. But lack of evidence for the existence  of something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something  (the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they  disprove evolution the establish creation). You (personally) have never  seen a neutrino before, but they exist. The \\\"pink unicorn\\\" analogy breaks down and is rather naive. I have a scientific theory that explains the  appearance of animal life - evolution. When I draw the conclusion that  \\\"pink unicorns\\\" don't exist because I haven't seen them, this conclusion has it's foundation in observation and theory. A \\\"pink unicorn\\\", if it did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities. That is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from \\\"more primitive\\\" ancestors these pink unicorns would share  a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. God, however, has no such correspondence with anything (IMO). There is no physical frame work of observation to draw ANY conclusions FROM.      I disagree with you profoundly on this. I haven't defined God as existence - in fact, I haven't defined God. But this might be getting off the subject - although if you think it's relevant we can come back to it.    You are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand what I'm saying. I'm making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy. I'm not trying to convince you of anything. *I* Believe - and that rests upon Faith. And it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you that they can logically prove God or that they have \\\"evidence\\\" or ..., then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).  BTW, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not EVEN wrong.    I don't follow you here. Certainly one can make observations of things that they didn't know existed. I still maintain that one cannot use observation to infer that \\\"God does not exist\\\". Such a positive assertion requires a leap.       Once again you seem to completely misunderstand me. I have no EVIDENCE that \\\"'god is' is meaningful\\\" at ANY level. Maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of God down your throat. I, however, am not doing this. I am arguing one, and only one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap - it requires faith. I am, as you would say, a \\\"theist\\\"; however, there is a form of atheism that I can respect - but it must be founded upon honesty.     \",\"    I'm not sure what you mean by 'saving face' unless you are confusing the FBI with the BATF who are the ones who were in charge of the original search warrant.

Some new drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some* track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.  I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.  Hope this helps.\",\"   Marc is not spoofing.

And so, by their own choice, they will remain in darkness, sort of like bugs under a rock.  However, some people, but not many, will not like the darkness.  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable. These people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded at first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  And, after a while, now that they can see things for what they really are, they will also see the heights which they can reach, and the places they can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through the world, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their successes.  They will see that there is much much more to the world than just the narrow experiences under the rock.  They will discover that life under a rock was incredibly yucky, and that life on their own terms is great -- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it.  Do you see my point?  I think you're the one under the rock, and I'm getting a great tan out here in the sunlight.  My life has improved immesurably since I abandoned theism -- come and join me!

Surely if you believe in it this strongly, you must have a good *reason* to, don't you?   When did I say that?  I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead of being subject to the whims of a deity, but that if the deity decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am, then so be it.   Nope -- most people are Christian.  Most people are fond of feeling that they are imperfect, of believing that the world is an undesirable place, of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and holy again, of doing just as their priests tell them, like good little sheep.

D1).  I thought I'd post it to stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by saying that I largely agree that the \\\"Space Age\\\" in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \\\"What's New\\\" - the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of matter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \\\"mind children\\\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do *now*.     Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...   SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW  Micheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)  At 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis.  The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no longer define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion -dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards.    Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science and technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy.    To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead.  .....  Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion to build space station Freedom alone.  Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains, Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken public champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much.  Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar space budgets.  Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.    ......  While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's technological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been slashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions its competitiveness agenda.  ......\",\"You are right in supposing that the problem is with the XmNcolormap (XtNcolormap for truly literate beings) not being set.

Thanks\",\" There is no law prohibiting having biological weapons or nerve gas on his/her property, or even walking on government property with such items: ipso facto it is now one's _RIGHT_ to have such weapons of \\\"mass destruction.\\\"  Hell, the U.S. patent office has patents on the manufacture of nerve gas that anyone can obtain simply by sending a $1.50 to the Patent Office in Washington, D.C. (P.O. Box 8). These same patents are verboten to English citizens from their own patent office, which doesn't surprise me based on the mistrust of the UK government against private ownership of semi-automatic rifles. \",\"Archive-Name: rec-autos/part6  [New article as of 4 February 1993 -- rpw]   Many people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite automotive topics; rather fewer know how to do it.  This article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard Unix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com for a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can list it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the Usenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)  First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin, or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you have trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is probably not good enough.  Listserv:  There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which is available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably  look at listserv carefully.  The Alias file:  On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on whichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:  foo:   bar, baz, bletch   which means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is redistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest possible email list is   my-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address my-favorite-car-request: my-address  this has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can do the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:  my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list my-favorite-car-request: my-address  Where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory, owned by the list admin.  Bounced Mail:  this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating. Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup, by the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)   school-request:   welty school-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list school: \\\"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\\\" owner-school: school-request owner-school-out: school-request   here's what is going on here:  the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail coming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point of contact for administrative duties.  school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses, it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending the email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name; the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the actual list members.  the shell script i use is as follows:  ----------------- #!/bin/sh cd /tmp sed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \\\\         (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          cat -) | \\\\         /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\\                 -F \\\"The ${1} Mailing List\\\" ${1}-rebroadcast exit 0 -------------------  note that this script does not know the name of the list; the name is passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple lists (i run several out of this site.) the script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming message, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to: 99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request or owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.  For digested lists, there is some digestification software around. Hopefully I'll be able to provide more information in a future version of this posting.  richard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com)\",\" Any suggestions as to what a better solution might be?

A better one might be the July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our major English newsmagazine) by Decima Research ...

I haven't had a chance to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private system had support within statistical noise.  The Decima polls are considered definitive.

Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.

A columnist for the St.  Paul \\\"Pioneer Press\\\" wrote an article giving the \\\"inside scoop\\\" on the  issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible  candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic  Center (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty  confident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will  ultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other  two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the  inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name)  believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also,  because of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed  until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.   However, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed,  because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for  conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to  this mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future  viability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even  further.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of  knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging  Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met,  which may happen.  Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are  Hartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \\\" Ice Demons?\\\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't  been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the  Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in  as many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see  Hartford and Tampa show up there either. So, Minnesota may end up  getting another team, but it may take a few years.     Go Sabres!\",\"This is to let you know that the fourth issue of the Copt-Net Newsletter  has been issued.

The primary U.S. objection is ``Iran's international behaviour'' which includes ``extending support of violence'' to disrupt the Arab Israeli peace process and its rapid build-up of dangerous weapons.  Mack said ``Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace but first it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area.''  Mack spoke at the U.S.-GCC business conference aimed at promoting Gulf-American trade. He said the ``Middle East will be an item very high on the agenda of the U.S. administration.''  The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State Warren Christoper's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhere else in the world, Mack said. He added that the U.S. has no long-term plan to station troops in the Gulf.  Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue to pressure Iraq to ``comply with all the U.N. Security resolutions.''  ``As long as Iraq is ruled by Saddam Hussein we do not expect compliance,'' Mack told delegates. \",\" No, they fold on the dotted line.

For instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain blanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actually performed the action isn't the murderer (but I guess this is actually made clear in the below definition).   What do you mean by \\\"reasonable?\\\"  [...]  Yes, it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition.  But, even though the series is recursively infinite, I think the meaning can still be deduced.   [math lesson deleted]  Okay, let's look at this situation:  suppose there is a longstanding feud between two families which claim that the other committed some travesty in the distant past.  Each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family.  Now, let's suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you don't like dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, there is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty. How do you resolve this?  Well, they are all murders.  Now, I suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your \\\"problem,\\\" but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.  And, in any case, the nested \\\"murderer\\\" in the definition of murder cannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity. And, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition?  See, in a totally objective system where all the information is available, such a nested definition isn't really a problem.\",\"Does anyone work with the A/ROSE card?

Before every instruction some specified registers are masked, eg. to simulate a stuck-at-1-error in certain bits.  Normally, the \\\"crash instance\\\" of A/ROSE notices a crash, sets a flag and stops working. By reading the mentioned flag the Mac can notice a card crash. That works fine for almost all crashes, but as said, sometimes the card doesn't set the flag and disappears from the system.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port         2. X terminals         3. NeXT         4. Silicon Graphics         5. IBM RS/6000  6. Other stuff      1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port   If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard  (Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding  a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation  runs the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used  PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable  to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read  the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.   The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.   a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and  even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server  extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your  server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings  appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,  you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,  or bugging your vendor.   kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.  Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.   Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.      2. X terminals   Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use  PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all  set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the  trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add  extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around  for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.      3. NeXT   NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop  Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they  were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of  upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!      4. Silicon Graphics   Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and  beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't  believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not  possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by  upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more  details.      5. IBM RS/6000   IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||  Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||  cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||  smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||  it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||  works.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||  told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||  anything new, please send me e-mail.        ||          6. Other stuff   Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)  support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your  queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can  get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either  from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in  luck.  Contact the companies for more details.   Apple Adjustable Keyboard     Apple Computer, Inc.     Sales offices all over the place.      Availability: February, 1993     Price: $219     Supports: Mac only      Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The     keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate     backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are     arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.      The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.     A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.      The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not     directly attachable to the keyboard.      As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from     TidBITS available there.   FlexPro Keyboard     Key Tronic     Phone: 800-262-6006     Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299     Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops      Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)     Price: $489 (?)     Supports: PC only (highly likely)      Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's     another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both     the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.     The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.      Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will     probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.   DragonDictate-30K (and numerous other Dragon products)     Dragon Systems, Inc.     320 Nevada Street     Newton, MA  02160      Phone: 800-TALK-TYP or 617-965-5200     Fax: 617-527-0372      Shipping: Now.

The program is called a2x, and is  available via anonymous ftp:   soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/a2x.tar.Z  export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/a2x.tar.Z (most current)   If you want to use your Dragon product with X windows, you may want  to ask for Peter Cohen, an salesman at Dragon who knows more about  this sort of thing.      Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products.     Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles     (including PS/2's and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you     a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number     of popular word processors and spreadsheets.      Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions     to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple     people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file     for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.     On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between     words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.     I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000.      The DragonDictate-30K can recognize 30,000 words at a time.     The DragonWriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time.      Dragon's technology is also part of the following products     (about which I have no other info):   Microsoft Windows Sound System (Voice Pilot)  IBM VoiceType  Voice Navigator II (by Articulate Systems -- for Macintosh)  EMStation (by Lanier Voice Products -- \\\"emergency medical workstation\\\")   The Bat     old phone number: 504-336-0033     current phone number: 504-766-8082      Infogrip, Inc.     812 North Blvd.     Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70802, U.S.A.

(new price!)       ||      Each hand has its own \\\"pod\\\".  Each of the four main fingers has five     switches each: forward, back, left, right, and down.  The thumbs have     a number of switches.  Despite appearances, the key layout resembles     QWERTY, and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to.  The idea is     that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.  The whole pod     tilts in its base, to act as a mouse.

The hardware design is relatively  easy for the company to re-configure.      Price: $690, including one system \\\"personality module\\\".      ||      The idea is that one keyboard works with everything.  You purchase     \\\"compatibility modules\\\", a new cord, and possibly new keycaps, and     then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines.      It's a three-piece folding keyboard.  The layout resembles the     standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections.  Each     section is on a \\\"custom telescoping universal mount.\\\"  Each section     independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each     individual to type in a natural posture.  You can rearrange the three     sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).  Each     section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections     flat, and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard).

The $690 includes one foot  pedal, one set of adhesive wrist pads, and a TypingTutor program.  An additional foot pedal and other accessories are extra.      The layout has a large blank space in the middle, even though the     keyboard is about the size of a normal PC keyboard -- slightly     smaller.  Each hand has its own set of keys, laid out to minimize     finger travel.  Thumb buttons handle many major functions (enter,     backspace, etc.).      You can remap the keyboard in firmware (very nice when software won't     allow the reconfig).      Foot pedals are also available, and can be mapped to any key on the     keyboard (shift, control, whatever).   Maltron  (+44) 081 398 3265 (United Kingdom)     P.C.D.

Soft rubber keys, which rock     forward and backward (each key has three states), make chords for     typing keys.  Learning time is estimated to be 2-3 hours, for getting     started, and maybe two weeks to get used to it.      Currently, the thumbs don't do anything, although a thumb-trackball     is in the works.       The company claims it takes about a week of work to support a     new computer.

If we can get people in the (arena) door by being uncomplicated, then let's do so.  Once we have them, they will realize what a great game hockey is, and we can then teach them something abotu the history of the game.       No, I would not want to see a Ballard division.  But to say that these owners are assholes, hence all NHL management people are assholes would be fallacious.  Conn Smythe, for example, was a classy individual (from what I have heard).    Also, isn't the point of \\\"professional\\\" hockey to make money for all those involved, which would include the players.  What I think you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as should have been their due, and it is the players that are what make the game great not the people who put them on the ice, so naming division after management people rather than players is adding insult (in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was deserved).   \",\"    \",\"Is posible to make copies of these photographs (or any other aerospace photographs at NASM) if you pay a copyright fee?\",\"Does anyone know any good decipleship trainning program during min August  to end of Sept.

The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and clothing for weapons or services.

In fact, \\\"hi'ipoi\\\", the Hawaiian word for \\\"cherish\\\" means \\\"sharing food\\\".  The Great Mahele, in which the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and the poor, was a white man's idea.

No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.  I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.

No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC.

On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:  A (partial?) list:  1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them   concurrently.  2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac  and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice  with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)  3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For  instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor  212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will  work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the  termination, plug it in, and away it goes.  4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that  the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is  quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:  to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very  noticable, as many things can be going on at once.  One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card.    Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits  for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.   The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed  unsafe under federal air quality laws.        \\\"People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to  exacerbate that inflammation,\\\" said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental  Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  \\\"When people are on  the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over  the edge.\\\"       The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits  with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter  of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because  they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of  compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10  exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.        In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at  levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30  microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with  asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.        The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory  Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung  Association's medical section.        The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that  particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study  by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles  may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.   Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms  and bronchitis in children.        \\\"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\\\"  says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"But more and more research is showing that particles are  bad actors as well.\\\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate  air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated  pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex  and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  acid aerosols.        \\\"Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects  of particulate air pollution,\\\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"We have no way of  duplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \\\" Consequently, most of what  is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research  like the Seattle study.        Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur  dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any  time soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with  asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.      \\\"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only  cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's  rarely particulate matter,\\\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \\\"However, PM10 doesn't have  to be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\\\"                                HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993                 NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma  The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on  Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in  dermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance  techniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care  professionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological  characteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management,  and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi  and their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in  preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days of  presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel  weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement.    Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a  distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins;  (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential  for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical  excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and  extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4)  patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high  risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely;  (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for  melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education  and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality  from melanoma.

Within the program, there are four types  of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily  in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on  clinical research; \\\"comprehensive\\\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a  multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community  outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer  prevention and control research.    Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was  the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new  cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage  of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened  the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and  cancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew  progressively.    In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today,  there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria  for comprehensive status.    To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an  institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly  established in 1990, the eight criteria for \\\"comprehensiveness\\\" include the  requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in  several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong  program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings  into clinical practice.    Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly  beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also  referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting  the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass  strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials,  significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important  outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of  sources.    The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and  capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit  important new findings or address timely research questions.

These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers  engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators  and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications  from new discoveries in the laboratory.    Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and  clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently  incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their  overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today.    Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely  structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and  control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health  departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention  and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions  responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.   Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with  institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community  hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.    Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward  creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through  interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the  laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

The  decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to  test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of  Health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and   Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the  therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies  including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH  that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is  intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the   replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's  reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the  MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.   \\\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the  next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\\\" said Shalala.    Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine  Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had  convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested  simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of  multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two  years.  ==================================================================       HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  \\\"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV\\\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol.  114, No. 14, P. 18        AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was  approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome,  the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the  drug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that  although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk  of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit   disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of  the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the  drug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S.  researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials,  many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients  experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of   AIDS symptoms.

The atrocities committed by the Armenian   volunteer forces accompanying the Russian army were so severe that the   Russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the   fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties. The memoirs of many  Russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with   accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these Armenian   guerrillas, which were savage even by relatively primitive standards of  war then observed in such areas.[1]\\\"  [1] \\\"Journal de Guerre du Deuxieme d'Artillerie de Forteresse Russe       d'Erzeroum,\\\" 1919, p. 28.  : >honored me by reproducing my text.

For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people lived  on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet  and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The  Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its  Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the  remainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years,  Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds.   The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.

Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its  predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against  humanity.  x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims  by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.

To one brought up, as most Americans have   been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of   the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious  differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they  were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every   nation in the world would have treated as treasonable.

I'am arguing about  : the Armenian-Nazi colaboration during World War II. Any comment?   It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941,  while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration  camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian  battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had  grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the  cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party  leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by  this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed  and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the  members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of  extermination of the Jews.  This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \\\"encore\\\" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.  Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia (around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who could be expected to oppose their plans.   On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even  though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over 60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the  British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left  the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few  Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring.   Rawlinson wired to his superiors,   \\\"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in  independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops   being without discipline and not being under effective control,  atrocities were constantly being committed.\\\"    Come again?  : \\\"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...

British promised to Venizelos (greek PM) that mainly greek populated areas of the Ottomans will be given to Greece, _if_ he will agree to drag Greece in the side of the British during the WWI (because the greek King was proGerman). The British succeeded by bombarding Athens (1916), killing quite a few, forcing abdication of the King, division of Greece into two separate states (North-South), and finally laying the ground for the most disasterous division between greeks for our century.(So don't feel bitter that the \\\"Allies\\\" gave any green light because they liked us....)  Anyway, the British succeed to establish Venizelos, war starts at a second front against the Germans in the south while they were fighting the war in the East against the Russians, and finally the WWII came in an end. After that the British (and French) forgot immediately their promises (as usually). Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek cause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usual \\\"reasoning\\\" and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they gradually backup Kemal (who had given now to the British \\\"water and bread\\\" that he will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small ethnic-state). The main drive behind this British switch was the plan to keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansion into warm-water facilities. The \\\"greek empire\\\" being an Orthodox Christian state was too prone to become Russian client.  Out of this intrigue, the current state of affairs was established on our lands. While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true \\\"Giants\\\" by the British, since they worked to realize their goals in the region. Under the same plan, currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of big military funds from the US; both they are functioning as anti-Russian buffers, while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept. because otherwise the use of terror of changing \\\"the balance of power in the Aegean\\\" will be used.

The processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the computer is used in its designed purpose.  Comparing processor speed is pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed to increase speed among other things.   I mean how can you say a 040 is faster than a 486 without  giving is operational conditions?  Can you say the same when  you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions. Knowing that 040 does not have transidental functions building in to  its FPU and 486 does, can you say that 040 is still faster?   Anyway, I hope people do not decided upon wether a computers is good or not solely on its processor.  Or how fast a processor is based on its name, because one can alway do a certain things to a processor to speed it up.

P. A1.  NEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE   * INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage    by a man who infiltrated political groups  By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.  SAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-time art dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In reality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40 years.  His code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office.  For a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White Aryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he obtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people.  And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government to trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills.  These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former Los Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with police and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League.  Officials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improper activity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They have refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz.  Transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents released by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory.  At times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air with laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like \\\"Ironsides\\\" and \\\"Flipper.\\\"  On one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a pro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa, Israel.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties to Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him.  Shortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed him.  The court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIA agent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League.  Gerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its contents included passports, driver's licenses and identification cards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for four American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank birth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies.  Also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a black hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of blindfolded and chained men.  Investigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the ADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one target group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.  Each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant.  The Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil rights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL's fact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists.   However, evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept files on at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the United Farm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center for Investigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, the Asian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP.  The computer files also included information on several members of Congress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey from the Bay Area.  In their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation League has collected information on political activists in the Los Angeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely with three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized in intelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism expert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligence officer.  A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation, and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declined comment.  Bullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as a volunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party.  Bullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by the ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In the mid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the West Coast.  To keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never missed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said.  \\\"I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all anti-democratic movements,\\\" Bullock said.  \\\". . . Officially, I'm only a contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would not be officially connected with me.\\\"  Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists to Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own name but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink.  \\\"I'm one of a kind,\\\" he told police.  In recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly become known, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him.  In the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police.  In part because of this investigation, he became close friends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Francisco police intelligence division.  Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An FBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group:  \\\"Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and would share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to Gerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to Bullock.\\\"  From a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876 individuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose files contained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people.  In 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the South African government.  Bullock tells of meetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100 bills.  Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published by San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African Bishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli -- and submitted it as his own work.  Bullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence.  Bullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African government evenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, \\\"I may be gay but I'm a straight arrow.\\\"  In his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law.  For example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records and criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said Gerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence files on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy.  Bullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation of Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League's San Francisco office.  Bullock seemed proud of his \\\"Operation Eavesdrop,\\\" in which he used a paid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White Aryan Resistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by members of the right-wing group.  \\\"For a short time, it was wonderful,\\\" he told police.  In Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a \\\"fact-finder\\\" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups.  Among other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los Angeles ADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had \\\"anti-Israel leanings\\\" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment.  Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate group.  Gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the probe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation.  Unlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation.  Gurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed by The Times. Bullock's attorney said his client would not comment.\",\"Detroit's going to beat Toronto in 6 or LESS!!!   Granted, Gilmour should get the Hart Trophy, NOT Lemieux...

I don't think that it's because it was the war that hit Israel the hardest.  Also, in 1967 it was Egypt, not Israel who kicked out the UN force.  In 1948 it was the Arabs who refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SET BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  In 1956, Egypt closed off the Red Sea to Israeli shipping, a clear antagonistic act.  And in 1982 the attack was a response to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the Golan Heights.  Children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and Israel finally retaliated.  Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that  the borders could be expanded.

Is anyone out there in Christendom listening? If so, why don't we get some dialog going here?  Here's a topic to get things started. My daughter's Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent something *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a national (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible.   What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war.   Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days. Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it happen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand.

There is no such thing as wrap at this university. I also asked around here. Ther is no wrap at  Marquette, University of Wisconsin Madison, Utah State, Weber State or Embry Riddle U. I am not saying that it doees not happen but in every instance that I have been able to track down it does not. Also the president of our University who was Provost at University of West Virgina said that it did not happen there either and that this figure must be included in the overhead to be a legitimate charge.   I did they never heard of it but suggest that, like our president did, that any percentage number like this is included in the overhead.   No Allen you did not. You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee of the Overhead capital of NASA. Nothing that Reston does could not be dont better or cheaper at the Other NASA centers  where the work is going on. Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is at a place where everything is overhead.   Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally demanded change that caused the problems? Methinks that you are being  selective with the facts again.   If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost of 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year. You stated that your \\\"friend\\\" at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it for a billion a year \\\"if the wrap were gone\\\".

Many of our monitors, as they age, develop shadows on white and bright colors. \",\"  I remember seeing an artical on large-engine oil  requirements, and one of the ways of prolonging the life of the oil was to run through a heated un-presurized chamber to allow water and volitiles to boil off. This made such long-term usage of  oil practical.  Isn't the Discovery channel great!?! \",\" Yes, it's important to realize that all actions have consequences, and that \\\"rules\\\" were made for our own good.  But to suggest that a *disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is  taking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease for lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed blindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare say all of us would be walking into walls.  Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real* careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for  sin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the result of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was blind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any other STD is a *punishment\\\" for sexual sin, what do we do with  diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as debilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a specific behavior or lifestyle?  Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin. The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central message of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins, and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of our sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He has graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or  some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that Jesus made.  In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ, no more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think it's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus healed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS. She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed  relationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be, but God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining weight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes her improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.  Paul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I  think applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I (or something like that).  May we all experience and accept God's grace.   =============================================================================== Paul Conditt  Internet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.edu Applied Research Phone:   (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416/3259   Laboratories  Fedex:   10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423 University of Texas Postal:   P.O.

I'm going on what I have read and heard from friends. Basically the Glock is great but I have heard/read that it is a lot harder to learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has.  I was looking at a Glock .40S&W and the S&W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the safties on the guns were very different.  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot more \\\"safe\\\"  (for lack of a better word) than the one on the Glock.  Of course this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  You would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.  Personally I like the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool (guess that's why they use them in so many movies) but I wouldn't get one as my first semi-auto because of the safety.  I would prefer more training with a \\\"traditional\\\" semi-auto (ala Colt .45) but of course that's just my opinion.\",\"HP 48SX calculator with 128K card.

Anyone who agrees with something  I say can't be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \\\"scientific\\\"  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \\\"If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.\\\"    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \\\"There've got to be controlled studies\\\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying \\\"We don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.\\\"    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  \\\"Why should I prove your  theory?\\\"  and  \\\"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\\\"   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of  books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as I'm capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \\\"doctrinnaire\\\"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\": Frank Crary posted: : : Sure, but the difference in per-capita crime rates predates the : : gun control laws: The homicide rate in England was a tenth that : : of America, back when anyone in England could buy a gun without : : any paperwork at all.  : Steve Manes asks: : > Got a citation for this?  : Colin Greenwood from Scotland Yard did a study that showed that gun : control has had no effect on crime or murder rates in the UK.

I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience can be trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something so materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess anything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were discussing the \\\"mind\\\" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal, as it were; and half spiritual.   ?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the ?possibility of error appears.

To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain.  This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method.   ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?\\\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some ?

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we   agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.   When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could   get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he   started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had   miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed   another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was   their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I   reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be   treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole   deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,   snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by   the turn of events.  Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting   to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and   asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him   that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,   that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs   and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still   pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to   lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told   him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.  A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all   apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus   knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about   it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,   and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....  I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we   decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him   back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the   truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the   incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of   there in my new truck in about 30 mins.  So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not   have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales   person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I   sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their   mistake.  Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred   dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.

As some of you may be aware, I've posted a lot of articles lately on personality typing (of which the MBTI is a test vehicle).  To come up to speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for by personality type summary file.  One observation is that people have significantly different personalities (no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect to church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while other people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more solitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if confronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of people.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.  My impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and create environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted (there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am quite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches to participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very uncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly influenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing. (BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both preferences have their place in the Body).  Maybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words are usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert scale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is excerpted from my summary:  1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:          Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside                           world of people, activities or things.          Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal                           world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.   Hopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can structure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise the Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities to fit them into a particular framework.  I'm sure there are other aspects of how churches have not properly understood personality variances among their members to the detriment of all.

Yes, Cripple *might* be for end-to-end encyption, dropping to clear when the other end doesn't have Cripple.

I guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material.  do you know of a generic (cheaper) substitute?  My headlight is a Halogen 60/55 W bulb.  Is there an easy, brighter replacement bulb available?  Where should I look for one?  As always, I very much appreciate your help.  The weather in Philadelphia has finally turned WARM.  This weekend I saw lotsa bikes, and the riders ALL waved.  A nice change of tone from what Philadelphia can be like. . . .  Chris \",\" Purists often distinguish between \\\"true\\\" clubbing and \\\"pseudo\\\" clubbing, the difference being that with \\\"true\\\" clubbing the angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly negative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip). With \\\"pseudo\\\" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then negative, which is the normal situation. \\\"Real\\\" internists can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple of minutes.  Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only \\\"true\\\" clubbing is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is very reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the  congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization.   The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally.   Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however, the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.\",\"; ;>Most people wave or return my wave when I'm on my Harley. ;>Other Harley riders seldom wave back to me when I'm on my ;>duck. Squids don't wave, or return waves ever, even to each ;>other, from what I can tell. ; ;  When we take a hand off the bars we fall down!  The problem is that Squids and BadAssBikers can't recognize each other's waves.  When you're riding a cruiser, you \\\"wave\\\" by lifting two or three fingers of the left hand, without first removing that hand from the handlebar.  When you're riding a crotch rocket, you lower the left hand to about ankle level, palm forward, and call that a wave.  Generic bike riders actually seem to raise the hand entirely off the handlebar and wave it around, so it's easy to tell when they're waving. \",\" Dr. cheghadr bA namakand!

But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.  1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)  2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere.  3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.  4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to any of the original points.  I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)   An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting at a point. This might be easier to implement.\",\" [FAQ and Darius' response deleted]    I am myself an SDA and I am in total agreement with what Darius has to say.   I also worship on Saturday to honor the Lord.  Your mention of \\\"[esteeming]  all days alike\\\" IMO has to do with the fast days observed by the Jews.  But  no matter how you interpret that passage, I do accept your worship on Sunday  as being done in honor of the Lord, in contrast with what many of my fellow  SDA believers may believe.  To me, though, the bible overwhelmingly points  to Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of God's  deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.  To those who would  attempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic,  this is simply not the case.  Rather, keeping Saturday allows me a full day  to rest and contemplate God's goodness and grace.    The idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted the  Corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the first day of the  week was because that was when they received their weekly wages.  Paul  wanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority, before  spending their money on other things.  I do not have any proof in front of  me for this though, although it would explain why they would lay aside money  in their homes instead of a meeting.     It would seem to me that you assume that the christians in the NT regularly  worshipped on the first day.  I assume that the christians in the NT  regularly worshipped on the seventh day.  But I agree with you that we only  have implications because the authors did assume the reader knew when worhip  was.\",\" There is an excellent software program called Astro.calc that does that and much more.

She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she  believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.   (Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the  food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit forming) ?  This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are: Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in  pet food?  ----------------------------------- I speak for myself and not Motorola -----------------------------------  \",\"  So how much would it cost as a private venture, assuming you could talk the U.S. government into leasing you a couple of pads in Florida?   \",\"  maybe the missile didn't hit directly such that his body gets \\\"desintegrated.\\\"  of course, destroying 10 houses to kill someone is not a surgical operation, or is it?      \",\"           Yep...

Move to Canada.  Yesterday I was able to watch FOUR games...the NJ-PITT at 1:00 on ABC, LA-CAL at 3:00 (CBC),  BUFF-BOS at 7:00 (TSN and FOX), and MON-QUE at 7:30 (CBC).  I think that if each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd consecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess).  I have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE and keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two afternoon games.  Btw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemed to know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore and they did an excellent job.  They were quite impartial also, IMO.  \",\" Gulp.

Your fascist government got away with  the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying  the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away  with the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in  Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem  districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed and hundreds of civilians also perished.     Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included     the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,    Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives,     children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians     joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan     districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of    3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished    to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to    the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and    seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell    into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims    themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels    also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the    large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from    occupying the city.     The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out    the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the    neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They    raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours'    distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.     At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,    Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible    atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in    the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the    neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.     Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the    Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four    villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,    they continued to spread death and destruction among the    Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down    their arms.

Again, just an offshoot of believe-it-and-it-becomes-true- don't-believe-it-and-it-doesn't.    Like other religions I'm aquainted with, Islam teaches exclusion and caste, and suggests harsh penalties for _behaviors_ that have no logical call for punishment (certain limits on speech and sex, for example).  To me this is not good.  I see much pain and suffering without any justification, except for the _waving of the hand_ of some inaccessible god.  By the by, you toss around the word knowledgable a bit carelessly. For what is a _knowledgeable believer_ except a contradiction of terms.  I infer that you mean believer in terms of having faith. And If you need knowledge to believe then faith has nothing to do with it, does it?\",\"wlsmith@valve.heart.rri.uwo.ca (Wayne Smith) write:  Nice of you to DELETE BOTH YOUR responce and the item that prompted it. to whit:                                       ^^^ To which YOU responded: To which I correctly pointed out the following:                          As I said this is sloppy and DUMB {YOU should resounded by DISCOUNTING the Mac NOT giving \\\"Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320\\\" example.

I was referring to the fact that far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For much of the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point where long-distance flights became practical.

However, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the Navigator's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and merchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be shared.     The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations can even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft), Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in 1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only a gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.   Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions asked. \",\"  On the one hand there are advantages to having the liturgy stay the  same.  John has described some of these.  On the other hand, some people  seem to start tuning out `the same old words' and pay attention better  when things get changed around.  I think innovative priests and liturgy  committees are trying to get our attention and make things more  meaningful for us.  It drives me crazy too.   Different people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy.  My  local parish is innovative.  I prefer to go to Mass at the next parish  over.  Sometimes we don't have the option of attending a Mass in the  style which best suits us.  John put a smiley on it but to \\\"just offer  it up\\\" probably is the solution.  A related issue, that it sounds like John does not have to deal with, is  that spouses may have different liturgical tastes.  My husband does like  innovative litury.  It is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual  needs without just going our separate ways.  When you include the factor  of also trying to satisfy our children's needs, things get pretty  complicated.

Note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application.  For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.

Here are some observations gained from painful experience:    1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.      Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more      sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.    2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear      that these things will itch for months.    3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of      it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,      since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could      find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special      collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is      required to get it.    4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old      folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall      reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers      burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I      think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some      sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.    5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.      A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally      applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is      another preparation called \\\"Chig Away\\\" that is a combination of      sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was      prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In      the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get      up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we      live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They      apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur      as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)    6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget      the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment      that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone      creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine      (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.      Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this      counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think      it gains nothing).    7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved      by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery      as well.  Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money.\",\"I have a 86 chevy sprint with a/c and 4doors. It's odometer turned 90k and the sensor light started blinking. I went to the dealer and he said it was a maintenance light saying I need to change the Oxygen sensor. He said, It is to be changed every 30k, but since I bought the car when it had 77k, I don't know if the same thing happened at 30k and 60k.  He quoted $198 for the part and $50 to install it. The part cost $30 outside, but the mechanic I went to could not fix it saying the sensor is placed too deep in the engine parts. He suggested I wait till it malfunctions before I do anything.

I've never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists that he has, so I'd love to have a cite.   Wrong.  There's one gun design where that can happen, and it is supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber. (Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under the hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe manner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their trigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.   The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the described circumstance) is near zero.

I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver with other similarly configured computers.  I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen.  The problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors start changing themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you open a full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't have any problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initially return to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly.  Also, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, the design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc.  The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the screen gets refreshed again.  If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell network, everything is fine.  I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to this machine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machine and the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I tried reloading Windows to no avail.  Any thoughts on things to check out?  I am totally baffled!  Thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction!\",\" While I agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding, I disagree strongly with your original point. The point of formal training  must be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion to know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike  in a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular. Countersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among  new bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the  motorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the direction opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous. I have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she is to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the  motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right  handle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road.  A worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn the rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.  The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency  situations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) of countersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.\",\" Still searching for an irrelevant issue in which to mire a pro-lifer, I see.

Where do they come  #from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from #whatever is societally mandated.  It's only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what is necessary to keep that society going  - and often it's a little over-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different thing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble), but is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating meat may be perfectly legal.  # #>#Merely a question for the basis of morality #># #>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_. #># #>#1)Who is society # #>Depends on the society. # #Doesn't help.  Is the point irrelevant?  No.  Often the answer is \\\"we are\\\".  But if society is those who make the rules, that's a different question.  If society is who should make the rules, that's yet another.  I don't claim to have the answers, either, but I don't think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things about the US system, at least in principle.  # #>#2)How do \\\"they\\\" define what is acceptable? # #>Depends. #On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).

The hard trick is to recognise when it is, and equally importantly, when it isn't.  # and only interfering when it's truly #>necessary. # #Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?  IMO, it isn't often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various kinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive  the right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort of liar's paradox: \\\"force is necessary for freedom\\\".   One possible justification is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if we don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom. # #  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem #>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem #>to agree that some level of interference is necessary. # #They see the need for a \\\"justice\\\" system.

What I see as arrogance and the problem I have  with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just  Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.    Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal  sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these  matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them  but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus  anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that leads to arrogance.

The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.

Should morals be based on social rules? On ancient religious doctrines? It seems there will *NEVER* be a common and single denominator for defining morals, and as such defining absolute and objective morals is doomed to fail as long as humans have  this incredible talent of creative thinking.  Cheers, Kent\",\"  Science does not progress via experimentation but by philosophising.  One aim of experiments is to investigate the validity of the hyptheses resulting from the models produced by this thinking process.   Science has one advantage of all other approaches to explaining the world. It is objective.   Anything which affects the physical world can be studied.  For example, since we are part of the physical world, anything (including spirits) which affects our behaviour can be observed.  Science does not make any claims about the existence or non-existence of objects which do not affect the physical world.   The purpose of science is to produce a model of the *physical* world.  The model must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome of future observations.  One of the aims of experiments is to carry out well defined observations which are objective.  Ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world, and the model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions.  At the moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some *spiritual* world existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a *spiritual* world.  As the non-spiritual models has fewer assumptions it should be the currently accepted models.  The scientific process never assumes that its present models are the correct ones, whereas many religions claim to represent the truth.  The arrogance of many theists is that they claim to represent the truth, this cannot be said of scientists.\",\" Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode (probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar not spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft.  In order to turn the spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be available, or you need to retrain a new team.  Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed. Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA  series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set. Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a \\\"standby\\\" mode for use in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is still required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is relatively cheap.  Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance to stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin- stabilized control mode because it would require little power or  maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time to time.  In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money), but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.\",\"I have an old tandon type modem (that's all the info I have apart from  the fact that it is black!).

Given how common they are eaten - do you know any child or adolescent who *doesn't* eat the stuff? - I think that if there were a relationship we would know it by now. Also, there's nothing weird in those cereals.  As far as the brain is concerned (except for a few infantile metabolic disorders such as galactosemia), sugar is sugar, regardless if it is coated on cereal, sprinkled onto cereal, or dissolved in soda, coffee or whatever.  There was some interest a few years ago in aspartame lowering seizure thresholds, but I don't believe anything ever came of it.\",\"We have a LAN where we are doing development on product for multiple platforms.  For the moment we are only working on MAC and DOS/Windows. The department has    always used sneaker net to transport files to the MAC, since it requires a       filter to strip out the <LF> characters.

Some other owners on the ford-probe@world.std.com mailing list have commented  about this problem, but I haven't seen it happen on my 3 month old  '93 Probe GT.  I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since  the initial batch of cars.  Also, someone said that Ford has issued a  service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you  may be able to get your dealer to fix it.   Haven't seen any of these problems, nor have I seen these mentioned on the mailing list, so these might just be having bad luck with these.   Definitely!   No problems like these either.  I haven't been able to find any obvious  places where they screwed up.   Hmmm!  I got two keys with my car.  Something tells me you got stiffed by your dealer on this.  (Actually, if you count the \\\"credit card\\\" key that  came in the owner's binder, I got 3 keys, but since the credit card key doesn't have any teeth cut in it yet, I guess I won't count it. :-))   The latter is probably because of the air bag.  It's pretty much takes up all the space where you'd expect to find the horn.  Speaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind. The previous Probes had Japanese horns.   Yeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.   I agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.  The interior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically sound.  ...  Yes, this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone.  I personally like it, but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, I'd strongly suggest looking into the MX-6.   The problem with the back seat is that there's no leg room.  Plenty of  head room, though.  Shorter people fit back there without any complaints, so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to  give them a place to put their feet.   The power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car. :-) I really enjoy the moonroof, by the way, but then I've always been a sucker for open air driving.  No leakage problems or anything like that...yet!   I haven't heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes ('89 and maybe '90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which Ford will replace at no charge), but I haven't heard about anything like this concerning the '93 Probes.  I haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot that was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my car.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering that I was expecting the worst from them!  From what I've heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with  the Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but  I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.  That's almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this, though.

Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some claim their heart \\\"skipped\\\" beats once in a while. Some reacted with headache, some stomach ache.

First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami, it had a summer atmosphere in early spring for baseball.  In comparison Wrigley Field in early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and bundled up fans.    The second and most important was the fans.  I like these guys/gals! I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball. It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to the Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering, I thought it was the AFC playoffs.  Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it, but I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with a lot of baseball fans in other cities.    Baseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansion teams bring back some excitement.

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier.

I've been working reduced hours the past couple of weeks because I had a son born (the day after Umar's article was posted, btw).  I did respond within a couple of days, but it turns out that a a coincidental news software rearrangement caused postings from this site to silently disappear rather than going out into the world.  This is a revision of that original response.   [this was in response to the claim that \\\"Rushdie made false statements about the life of Mohammed\\\", with the disclaimer \\\"(fiction, I know, but where is the line between fact and fiction?) - I stand by this distinction between fiction and \\\"false statements\\\"]   I had not seen that claim, or I might have been less sweeping.  You have made what I consider factual misstatements about events in the book, which I have raised in the past, in the \\\"ISLAM: a clearer view\\\" thread as well as the root of the \\\"Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW]\\\" thread.  My statement was not that you had not read the book, but that you had not convinced me that you [inter alia] had.  As I said before, if you want to defend your position, then produce evidence, and respond to the evidence I have posted; so far you have not.  Of course, my statement was not directly aimed at you, but broadly at a number of Muslim posters who have repeated propaganda about the book, indicating that they haven't read it, and narrowly at Gregg Jaeger, who subsequently admitted that he hadn't in fact read the book, vindicating my skepticism in at least that one case.  So far, the only things I have to go on regarding your own case are a) the statements you made concerning the book in the \\\"a clearer view\\\" posting, which I have challenged (not interpretation, but statements of fact, for instance \\\"Rushdie depicts the women of the most respected family in all of Islam as whores\\\"), and b) your claim (which I had not seen before this) that you have indeed read it cover to cover.  I am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on critical interpretation, but you'll have to support your end, by responding to my criticism.  I have no doubt as to the ability of a particular Muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding passages to take personal offense at, but you have upheld the view that \\\"TSV *is* intended as an attack on Islam and upon Muslims\\\".  This view must be defended by more than mere assertion, if you want anyone to take it seriously.   And I appreciate it, but welcome to the club.  I am defending my honest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated (or otherwise) insulting attack on Islam, and the parallel opinion that most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baseless propaganda.  I have supported my statements and critical interpretationa with in-context quotes from the book and Rushdie's essays, which is more than my correspondents have done.  Of course, you are more than welcome to do so.\",\"I've seen solar battery boosters, and they seem to come without any guarantee.

As many knowledgeable people have pointed out, msg is a naturally  occurring substance in a lot, if not most, foods.  When food  manufacturers add it to a preparation, they do so because it's a  known flavor enhancer.   Your wife's theory, that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite,  may well be true.  But I don't believe it's ALWAYS the reason it's  added.  People are (largely, for the most part) in charge of their  own appetites.   You don't know much about cats, do you?   Cats will Take Advantage of You.  Resign yourself:  you will never   understand a cat.  Their tastes are whimsical.    I also suspect, though it's been a while since I've checked ingredients  on commercial cat food, that there are much more stringent requirements  on pet food additives than human.    See, the FDA has this stupid idea that human beings have the intelligence  to look out after their own interests.  \",\" [Note: I just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself, from various people on the net, so I could be wrong.]  The data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such, of course), and eventually gets turned into 44.1 KHz, 16 bit, two channel data. Oversampling takes two discrete data points, and interpolates n-1 points between them for n times oversampling.  When I asked, people said that the interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more complicated.  Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the \\\"effective\\\" sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling lets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher oversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of all other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias filtering.\",\" No answer.

I've seen Gravis joysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my hand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than a year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability to adjust the tension of the stick.  I recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick.  I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works quite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so leaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear and feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or down in features.  For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here compared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra $10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.  Just another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something that needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up, down, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into a Gravis gamepad.

That's another of the dirty tricks they used to apply on us under the communist regime - do something secret, THEN tell the people about is (after the fact, when nothing can be done any more), and of course, explaining them how much better the situation is now...  In my previous messages I wrote that the Americans should wake up and fight against the new proposal. Now it seems to me that it is already too late - it has already happened, the civil liberties have been violated, no, stollen from the American people, while the most part of this people has been sleeping happily... :-((( Too sad...  Regards, Vesselin\",\"I have come across what I consider to be an excellent tract. It is a bit lengthy for a posting, but I thought I'd share it with all of you anyway. Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says. May God richly bless those who read it.   =======================================================================                      D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?     Q. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs,    tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, \\\"God Loves You.\\\"  Isn't    that true?   A. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read    in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:         For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten       Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but       have everlasting life.                               John 3:16           The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he       loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9         For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of       the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6     Q. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good    I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How    can these verses apply to me?   A. By  God's  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is    looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The    Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.    On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before    God.         As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There       is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after       God.                                            Romans 3:10-11         The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately       wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9     Q. If I am such a wicked person in God's sight, what will God do to me?   A. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will    come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.         For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the       lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,       and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap       mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They       shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,       and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of       beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.                                                 Deuteronomy 32:22-24     Q. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not    that bad.   A. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-    ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible    makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal    and consists of perpetual suffering.         And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was       cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15         So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come       forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall       cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and       gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50         ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with       his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them       that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord       Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting       destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory       of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9     Q. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?   A. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be    accountable to God for his actions.  God's perfect  justice  demands    payment for sin.         For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23         For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;       that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,       according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:10         But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,       they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.                                                        Matthew 12:36     Q. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought    to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?   A. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our    substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our    sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus    Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.         All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one       to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of       us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6         But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for       our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;       and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5         For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also       received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the       scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the       third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4         For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that       we might be made the righteousness of God in him.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:21     Q. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was    already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about    Hell anymore?   A. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it    is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.    Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.         He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he       that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath       of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36     Q. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that    the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to    Hell?   A. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our    minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole    lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to    the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins    and serve Christ as our Lord.         No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,       and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and       despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.                                                         Matthew 6:24         Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be       blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the       presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19     Q. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except    through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their    followers also go to Hell?   A. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-    able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other    religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their    followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and    save us.         Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none       other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be       saved.                                               Acts 4:12           I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the       Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6         If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us       our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.                                                           1 John 1:9     Q. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?   A. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You    must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see    your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.         And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much       as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,       God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13         ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe       on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...                                                        Acts 16:30-31     Q. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?   A. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He    also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that    He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.         For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of       yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8      God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,    if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you    should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is    the only Word of God.    In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented    paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.         So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of       God.                                              Romans 10:17     Q. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?   A. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging    our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.         The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a       contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17      Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin    to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we    sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins    as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to    Hell.         Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him       to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his       iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26     Q. Doesn't  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be    baptized?  Will these save me?   A. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.    No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God's    sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-    ure.  Salvation is         Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9     Q. What else will happen at the end of the world?   A. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed    into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-    more.         For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,       with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:       and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are       alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the       clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be       with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17     Q. What will happen to the earth at that time?   A. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens    and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-    more.         But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in       the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and       the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and       the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...       Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new       heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.                                                      2 Peter 3:10,13     Q. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will    come?   A. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to    save.         And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the       world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end       come.                                            Matthew 24:14     Q. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?   A. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing    of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the    Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not    come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the    Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be    very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.         For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden       destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with       child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3         Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his       secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7     Q. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.   A. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to    destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.         And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he       cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be       overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4     Q. What did the people of Nineveh do?   A. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented    of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.         But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry       mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil       way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can       tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his       fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9     Q. Did God hear their prayers?   A. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.     Q. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-    ment?   A. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has    become very short.         How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which       at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed       unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3         In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,       and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye       people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for       us.

A  number  of  minor changes  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing and  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph which  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the text.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they appear here as indented paragraphs.     I have read Mr. Camping's book, compared it with what the Bible actual- ly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that there  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed one  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these matters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return, it  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with respect  to life expectancy no longer applies.

To paraphrase Acts 20:27,  it  does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of God.  I am  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible with anyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of any real  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so little time  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.

This doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.    Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be, and isn't.     I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement.   First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ  could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the  male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.   Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.   Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option.   I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\",\"  It may have been passed to Toronto, but I've even seen an octopus at the Aud -- last year's Bruins-Sabres game.  I knew all about the Detroit version, but seeing at the Aud was a bit puzzling.  :-) \",\" John 12:24-26: \\\"Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls onto the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain.   \\\"He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.   \\\"If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also.  If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.\\\"  Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?  If we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us?  Why would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I will die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have before that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be content to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too are dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.  In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically mean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and fend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no matter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.  If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be it.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants my respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it does, then they will be very strong and true.   Jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was Osiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or Norse legend, if memory serves.  But still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?   If your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do -- provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any religion.   That's precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin. Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?   You've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he just rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.  But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the verses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view, which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only he or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with that: substitute \\\"Moslem\\\" or \\\"Buddhist\\\" or \\\"Satanist\\\" instead of \\\"Christian\\\", and it means the same thing.  Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD, you've got some convincing to do.   And in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities where there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life.  As long as you keep your beliefs to yourself, I'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start waving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.\",\"Here is the price list for the

According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies,   we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10   times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of   1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as   dramatically.      When standards of living, population densities, and industrial   structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy   efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group   of Seven nations.      Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil   price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the   cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,   even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the   overall U.S. economy.      Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per   $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.      Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side   management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource   inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not   reduce demand.      Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes   unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that   subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,   gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood   of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state   at the expense of the individual.      \\\"Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion\\\" is no.   189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an   independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.    Available from:   Cato Institute   224 Second Street SE   Washington, DC  20003    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                             The Cato Institute      Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research   foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate   to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the   traditional American principles of limited government, individual   liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve   greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in    questions of policy and the proper role of government.     The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets   that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th   century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation   of the American Revolution.     Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually   no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive   intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary   intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for   civil liberties.     To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive   publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy   issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned   to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military   spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy   conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are   published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.     In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts   no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations,   corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from   the sale of publications.  The Institute is a nonprofit, tax-exempt,   educational foundation under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue   Code.\",\"Sony D-22 portable Diskman forsale              Good condition, flawless.

It BM] seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      Again, Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves. What do      want them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.  BM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment, BM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it BM] is a part of it.    Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged  training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.   henrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000  henrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the  henrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending  henrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION.   BM]  Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them BM]  within their borders?     Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into          the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.  henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the  henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER  henrik] OCCUR again.  BM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?     It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped    into Armenia if SHE could.   BM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header BM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?     Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many         cases, HISTORY repeats itself.   BM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes  BM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring BM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians  BM] are attacking Azeri towns.   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey         wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!   I will believe it when I see it.   Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing         to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean  BURNING people ALIVE !  BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  BM] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.     Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are          NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN.   BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent  BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe  BM] the other out.

As for 'war' I am not sure how I would define it. If you just look at attacks on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. Would you count the riots in the 20's and 30's? Violence but not war. I personally think that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requires organisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces. Perhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it was so. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone organisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a cause for criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the 'Zionist' camp.   Now you are being silly aren't you? In any case the war did NOT start with the invasion of the Arab Armies. You see we both agree on something. And the previous posters were wrong, no?   Again I am not sure, I doubt you want my opinion anyway, but I think war requires organisation as I said before. It needs a group to command and plan. If Fatah lauches rockets from Southern Lebanon (and are you sure you have the right group - not the Moslems again?) then that sounds like war to me. Stone throwing does not.

When they commit fully to each other as life partners, they are married.  The ceremony may assist in emphasizing the depth of such a commitment, but is of itself nothing. God knows our hearts.  He knows when two have committed themselves to be one, he knows the fears and delusions we have that keep us from fully giving ourselves to another.  The way I see it, you'd have to be living together in a marriage for somewhere between 10 and 100 years before anyone knew if a marriage really existed, but God knows.

If society accepts such a system, then each member of society is to blame when an innocent person gets executed.  Those that are not in favor should work to convince others.  And, most members of our society have accepted the blame--they've considered the risk to be acceptable.  Similarly, every person who drives must accept the blame for fatal traffic accidents.  This is something that is surely going to happen when so many people are driving.  It is all a question of what risk is acceptable.

The hassle of photocopying the manual is offset by simplicity of purchasing the package for only $15.  Also, consider offering an inexpensive but attractive perc for registered users.  For instance, a coffee mug.  You could produce and mail the incentive for a couple of dollars, so consider pricing the product at $17.95.  You're lucky if only 20% of the instances of your program in use are non-licensed users.  The best approach is to estimate your loss and accomodate that into your price structure.  Sure it hurts legitimate users, but too bad. Retailers have to charge off loss to shoplifters onto paying customers; the software industry is the same.

The official line here (though I do have my doubts about it) is that the front brake is applied first, followed by the rear brake, the idea being that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place. In practice I suspect most people do what you describe.   If you don't slide the tyre, you have no way of knowing whether you've achieved maximum braking or not.

like those who use their backs instead of their minds to make }>their living who are usually ignorant and intolerant of anything outside }>of their group or level of understanding.  There seems to be some confusion between rednecks and white trash. The confusion is understandable, as there is substantial overlap between the two sets. Let me see if I can clarify:  Rednecks: Primarily use their backs instead of their minds to make a  living. Usually somewhat ignorant (by somebody's standards,  anyway) because they have never held education above basic  reading/writing/math skills to be that important to their  eventual vocation. Note I did not say stupid, just ignorant.  (They might be stupid, but then so are some high percentage  of any group).  White trash: \\\"White trash fit the stereotype referred to by the  word 'nigger' better than any black person I ever met, only  with the added 'bonus' that white trash are mean as hell.\\\"  -- my father. Genuinely lazy (not just out of work or under-  qualified), good-for-nothing, dishonest, white people who are  mean as snakes. The \\\"squeal like a pig\\\" boys in _Deliverance_  may or may not have been rednecks, but they were sure as hell  white trash.  White trash are assuredly intolerant of anything outside of their group or level of understanding. Rednecks may or may not be.\",\"    I'm sorry, I thought we were discussing heresy.  I assumed that heresy meant a departure from orthodoxy, in which case generally accepted belief is indeed an important issue.  In this case, the definition of the word \\\"create\\\" is of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed.     I should have said \\\"given the Mormon belief.\\\"  If you disagree with the Mormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally existent substance than one of ex nihilo creation, then that is the important point.     Correction: you interpret the Bible to mean something very specific by such terms.     It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they believe.  Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and Lucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or organized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being \\\"offspring\\\" of God has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually \\\"born again\\\" of Him.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.  This is how language works, Robert, and it's why making someone an offender for a word is dangerous.   <...>     On the contrary, Robert, it is not a red herring at all to show that those who rely wholly on the Bible cannot seem to agree on what it says.  You say that one must simply \\\"look at the Bible\\\" to see what it teaches, but centuries of people doing just that have sho0wn that no one is really sure what it says. Are we to believe that you are the only one who really understands the scriptures?     Let me clarify this one more time.  You did not refer to the Mormon belief that Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie's belief in same.  We keep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of Mormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it. (see below)     On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie's words as Mormon canon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great* importance.  The fact is that they are not.  Whether or not they indicate general Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large number of Mormons.\",\"[MODERATOR:  Nice summary, Keith, thanks.]  I talked to the federal Dept. of Justice (DOJ, Ottawa) to try and clarify a bunch of things regarding changes to Canadian gun laws. I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email, followup to t.p.g.  1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get    a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I    was told by a police officer. 2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to    protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns    must be stored locked up and unloaded, however. 3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will    be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.    The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form    authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.      Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these    'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will    be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess    them, but will not be allowed to stock them. 4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will    not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations    specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some     manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.    (God knows how much they'll charge for these)  This covers most of what we discussed.  I have typed this from memory, do not take it as gospel.  I am not a lawyer and I refuse to play one on TV.   --  -------------------------------------------------------------------\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis   Dear Josh  I appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions.  Having said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.  1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards identify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S. citizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are just trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or religious identity to any public official who so requests ?  2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all kinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy. You did not respond to my question.  3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is interesting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear weapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?  4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a Ma'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases like Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and imprisoned.  5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status of the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for the occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law). The law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so, why doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?  6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return conflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands of non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under Israel control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from returning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also left, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to return. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ? Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in his homeland ?  7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that information, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all inhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other atrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by Israeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University Press. Is this book available in your library ?  8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in Israeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very little evidence available about that. As much as I know, many Arabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are not accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want Arabs ?  9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was whether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to discourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but evaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants to keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious communities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests to officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a secular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.   I would be glad to have some more input from you after these comments.\",\"I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old (1 year?) Asante EN/SC adapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the newest drivers from Asante's ftp server.  The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain - specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac tests memory, etc. Just before the \\\"happy Mac face\\\" normally shows up, the power light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the Asante box pretty much unusable.  It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed during the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has *never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had it for over a year).  Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk -- several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator (both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal resistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another identical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.  Has anybody seen this? More importantly, does anyone have a solution? Thanks a lot.    E. \",\"Quoting Jeffrey J.

It is fast moving out of t.a scope, but I didn't know if t.a was the only group of the three that you subscribed to. Apologies to regular t.a folks.    You must be using 'values' to mean something different from the way I see it used normally.  And you are certainly using 'Science' like that if you equate it to \\\"the real world\\\".  Science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning those perceptions.  It has nothing to do with values as far as I can see. Values are ... well they are what I value. They are what I would have rather than not have - what I would experience rather than not, and so on.  Objective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are applicable to everyone.   I don't agree. Science is useful insofar as it the predictions mentioned above are accurate.  That is insofar as what I think *will be* the effect on my perceptions of a time lapse (with or without my input to the Universe) versus what my perceptions actually turn out to be.  But values are about whether I like (in the loosest sense of the word) the  perceptions :-)   I don't see why. 'Usefulness' in science is synonomous with 'accuracy' - period. Tarot predictions are not useful because they are not accurate - or can't be shown to be accurate. Science is useful because it is apparently accurate.  Values - objective or otherwise - are beside the point.  No?\",\": Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for : Windows 3.1.

I used to think pretty much the same thing, then I got 'educated.'  People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick (within a minute or so) death.  The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are 'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.  Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as the attacker.  Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their knife attacks in prison.  If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3 seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the pointed end.)  Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth. Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'  This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.  The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk (a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually do this.  Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason 'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive.  I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes.\",\"KM>  Is the 486DX3/99 anything more than a myth?

I am currently working on a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with Phoenix BIOS, using C++, to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU with UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and  Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit, but there seems to be something wrong with the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to access the unit I built using C, because I have a sizable chunk of C code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085.  I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code that I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack of knowledge about RS-232 serial communications, please e-mail me. I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and then to check it against the 0x20 character, if a 0x20 is received,  the LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do nothing, but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses the bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt int86() function in dos.h.  I have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 ) the parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits ) and the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ).  Currently, I am at a loss as to what may be wrong.  Any hardware gurus out there want to comment?

My point is that \\\"if life has meaning or importance then we should try to find that meaning or importance\\\" which is almost a tautology. (I hope I'm not being too patronizing.) One term for that meaning is \\\"Creator\\\", though that is not obvious from my above argument.   (It's more like \\\"I think, therefore I am, therefore God is.\\\")   Unfortunately the term \\\"religious\\\" is ambiguous to me in this context. I could say that searching for meaning in life is by definition being religious. I could say cult followers by definition have given up on  the search.  If you want \\\"meaning\\\" why not search for the truth?  So far, my understanding of Christianity is congruent with my understanding of truth.

If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad,  civilians die, right ? I am not so sure.   As somebody wrote, Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting manner. And he also claimed 'civilians murdered'.

Now, a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil' kind of Mediteranean sea. How do you define Israeli soil ? From what you say, if you do not clearly  recognize the state of Israel, you condone killing israelis anywhere.   I do not know what was the pupose of the action you describe. If it was  to kill civilians (I doubt), I certainly DO NOT CONDONE IT. If civilians were  killed, i do not condone it.       Mr. Hernlem, it was YOU, not ME, who was showing a huge satisfaction for 3  israelis (human beings by most standards, Don't know about your standards) killed.  If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a  question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing justifies murder. I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ? Am I wrong ?   Now tell me, did you also condone Saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in, let's say, Tel Aviv ? From what I understand, a lot of palestineans cheered. What does it show? It does not qualify for freedom fighting to me ?

The detection is actually through the transducer of sonar A; we can see a very faint 50Khz signal on the transducer, exactly at the time the init line of sonar B is activated.

Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic wrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a plaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12 minutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the goalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves padding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.   John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show.    Yeah, Essensa's mask looked really good.    Actually, I thought I heard him say that it _was_ Potvin's for certain.  I would bet money on it either way...and it did look awesome! \",\"     I don't have to \\\"try reading a bit\\\", Pat.  I *work* as a government contractor and know what the rules are like.  Yes, they sign some (damned few -- which is why everyone is always having to go to Washington to see about next week's funding) multi-year contracts; they also aren't willing to include sufficient cancellation penalties when they *do* decide to cut the multi-year contract and not pay on it (which can happen arbitrarily at any time, no matter what previous plans were) to make the risk acceptable of something like putting up a private space station with the government as the expected prime occupant.  I'd like a source for that statement about \\\"the reason they aren't cutting defense spending as much as they would like\\\"; I just don't buy it.

You are merely expressing \\\"approval\\\" of the consequences I find therein. Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my (or any) religion.  \\\"Love\\\" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians can write both the \\\"gentle\\\" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in a passage that even the \\\"conservatives\\\" will quote at you :-) -- and the words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \\\"Love is the unfamiliar Name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\\\"  This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise in my note, as will become more evident below.   blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though, given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of \\\"sin\\\" on another, and my unshakeable \\\"disestablishmentarianism\\\", Russel Turpin and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of Christian love.   You misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \\\"God\\\" in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:  The \\\"possibility that always exists\\\" is that I (or, to revert to proper time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could persuade \\\"Christian B\\\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian] prohibitions.  What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:   A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved      in the Inquisition.   B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however      painful this *seems*, \\\"discipline\\\" her children for their      own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or      if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example      \\\"deterring\\\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)   A.  I point out that this \\\"justification\\\" of a failure in love      depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of      philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.   B.  Burns me at the stake.  My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is going on here has a *lot* to do with \\\"cultural baggage.\\\"  In this case, the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B.  Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B, then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what- ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney.  So, \\\"one possibility\\\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in may others.  At the other extreme, the \\\"persuasion\\\" will succeed when it properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that many of the victims of Inquisition will have \\\"accepted\\\" that they were in fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them.)  The point is that the \\\"persuasion\\\" breaks down when the parties do NOT share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main thrust of the Inquisition, against \\\"heresy\\\", it is *bound* to break down in precisely the \\\"worst\\\" cases.  The \\\"conservative\\\" (I don't think that is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above, that he is \\\"justified\\\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to a \\\"greater good.\\\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow the gospel, as if one's theories about \\\"sin\\\" entitled one to cast aside Jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).  I am a \\\"radical\\\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.   Well, the whole *point* of making these the \\\"base\\\" commandments is that they *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \\\"Conservatives\\\" may twist this \\\"act as if you were God\\\" to mean \\\"lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.\\\" They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \\\"against God\\\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \\\"conservatives\\\" have confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.   And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged *different* \\\"ethical systems\\\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result, it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular (or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH. It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very little, if anything, in the way of \\\"commandments\\\" -- so little that the \\\"Christians\\\" who desperately *want* commandments go \\\"mining\\\" for them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-)) for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus specifically \\\"gives\\\" as \\\"a commandment\\\" to us is \\\"love one another.\\\"   [I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson   that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that   SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll   point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why   there is a huge amount of \\\"cultural baggage\\\" involved.]  You are quite right that this is \\\"goo\\\" if one is looking for an ethical system.  But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.   I think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity? [Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]\",\" If you write a second time to a CD you need to have multi-session capability to read the second session.  Whether it is photos or just data or whatever.  Here is a simplified way of looking at it: The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal' drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data.  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last directory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not taking multiple directories into account.\",\": They require two separate grounds.

Yup.   Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to  purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be one of the following: a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations:  The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.  The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any  organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions  to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are: - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.  - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.  Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).  The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members' use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet.   By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \\\"F\\\" motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart C, for details.  As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute, or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.  Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.   Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.   That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest misconceptions people have about our hobby.   True. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get  hit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand. \",\"I was posting to Alt.locksmithing about the best methods for securing  a motorcycle.

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.  Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch.  That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game, Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about  winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch.  Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible.  Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games.  I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.  But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan.    -- The Beastmaster   \",\"I am setting up a video-aid for a computer room for the teacher to share his display with the class.

On the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x,y positions are known.    Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron Danon's excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which converts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click the mouse.  Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values.  This is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process, scanner errors and what have you.  The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so \\\"global\\\" adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or rotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.  So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets of points   Reference(x,y) (the known true values)  DistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)  DistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)  what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to DistortedData to remove the errors.  I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a \\\"bumpy\\\" 3d surface, solving for the surface and then \\\"flattening\\\" it to remove the errors in the other data points.  Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet, pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?

Ville Siren's slap  shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi  scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal  put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.  The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo  made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,  during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.  Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to  Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered  the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund   skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.  Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line  where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since  there was traffic in front, 4-3.  Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \\\"the Shadow\\\" Nilsson. Stefan  and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to  Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.  Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only  21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone   with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja  made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.  The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal  late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,  showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck  and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.  But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the  game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow  angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.   All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.  Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period  to try no combinations.   Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-  Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.  Stillman good on defense.  Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner  hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson  will likely have to leave for NHL pros.   Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the  Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him  a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.  I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-  resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Starting lines:    SWEDEN     FINLAND    35.

Any pointers?  --\",\"  In order of your questions, I oppose it, I oppose it, I oppose it and (Huh?  Wha?  Where did _that_ topic come from and what's it got to do with the discussion at hand? :-)  When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes against different classes of people (and yes, I do consider laws which allow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the convict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit into that category), the category of classes I had in mind was that of the standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.  Having you ask about classes based upon one's _profession_ rather than one's personal characteristics caught me off guard, and I had to think out the question from scratch.  What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize such classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare some people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathema to the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.  Last year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plus crimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not protected by that \\\"aura of deterrence,\\\" critics pointed out the absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a civilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much more valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society. This was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents of that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their \\\"contribution to society.\\\"  I view that doctrine as being both (a) personally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment.  Accordingly, I believe that there should be no laws which give any profession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanism of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of that class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-ranking members of the Executive Branch of the federal government.\",\" The analogy does not depend on the premisses being true, because the  question under discussion is not truth but arrogance.   A similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood  transfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are  Jehovah's Witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood  transfusion. The doctor's efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood  transfusion could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as  Christians could be perceived to be arrogant.  The truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood transfusion is necessary  to save the life of the child is irrelevant here. What matters is that the  doctor BELIEVES it to be true, and could be seen to be trying to foce his  beliefs on the parents, and this could well be perceived as arrogance.\",\"I've been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers, notesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night at the Stick.  After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was  very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).  It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.  The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb. McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball. So on & so forth.  I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.

Other countries have different names for loose equivalents; autostrada, autoroute, motorway etc.   Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn't passed as far as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than the US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred to the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more professional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.   You're wrong. GTI's  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal  autobahn car.

This is an argument for why _you_ don't like religions that suppress sex. A such it's an irrelevant argument.  If you'd like to generalize it to an objective statement then  fine. My response is then: you have given no reason for your statement that sex is not the business of religion (one of your \\\"arguments\\\").  The urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong measures are required to suppress it. If the urge to have sex is so strong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to find a marriage partner.  \",\"[deletion] : >Perhaps these encryption-only types would defend the digitized porn if it : >was posted encrypted? : > : >These issues are not as seperable as you maintain. : >  : Now why would anyone \\\"post\\\" anything encrypted?

Reading the cases of people who've tried the various things Mr. Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes: (1) those who win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to their claim, and (2) those who lose.  Consider Newman v. Schiff, 778 F.2d 460 (8th Cir.1985), which I've seen cited by tax protestors other than Mr. Teel as a win for Mr. Schiff. Mr. Schiff offered $100,000 on TV to anyone who would call in the show and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says that an individual has to file a return.  Mr. Newman took him up on it.  Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast the next morning.  Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to people who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offer for Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, and so Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000.  Mr. Schiff was correct, and so won.  So, yes, Mr. Schiff won against a claim on the $100,000 reward.  However, his win had nothing to do with the tax code.\",\" I agree.

I don't think it is the function overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time in BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered in porting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of invalid C++ assumptions.  I have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but the reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in which static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are getting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the owner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all other pieces of ctrltest work fine.  Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:  - The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,   rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ   between MSC and BC).  - All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++   assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place   of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for   references).  I am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have not encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope that some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS's hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that. \",\"Enclosed are the rules, guidelines and related information for the 10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest.

I didn't suggest that all  government regulations be subject to referenda.  So I don't follow the  comments above.   I mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally undesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw support among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate.  Furthermore, I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an industrial society because the weight of litigation and/or misery it would produce would effectively crush productive effort.  No, I'm not surprised.  I just think it's interesting that on one hand libertarians assume a limited government can be decreed, yet on the other posit an entire government made up of people who carry guns.  (I realize that many libertarians assume that such a government will be  counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry, but it is worth noting that widespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the establishment of totalitarian government, e.g. Iraq.)  Yup, sure do.  But since I also support the constitutional requirement that the government provide for the general welfare (Article I section 8), I'm willing to justify such programs on that basis.  Well, in the first place, I don't support a \\\"socialized economic system.\\\" I think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea.  But it is not the case that \\\"any third party...is...as likely to be ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller.\\\"  There are multitudes of examples where such a statement is demonstrably false.  Regulation of stock market transactions that provide a reasonable basis for buyers to avoid fraud is only one example.  jsh \",\"          ^^^^^^^^^^   Josh, were you in such a hurry?

Surely the hypothesis relying on the least wild assumptions is to take this at face value. Our lads at the fort were asked to cook up something that's pretty secure, with a key that can be escrowed neatly, and they did. The government plans to sell this thing, for the reasons they state. Yes, those evil guys in the FBI can probably, with some effort, abuse the system. I got news for you, if the evil guys in the FBI decide they want to persecute you, they're gonna, and you're gonna hate it. Fact is, the FBI doesn't want to listen to your phone calls, and if they do, and if you're using triple-DES, they'll just get a parabolic microphone and point it at your head.   This is pretty clearly an effort by the government to do exactly what they're saying they're doing. As is typical with governments, it's mismanaged, and full of holes and compromises.

I'm looking into buying a serial port switcher, because while my Mac has two serial ports, I have AppleTalk, a modem, a printer, MIDI, and a sound digitizer.  (2 != 5, unfortunately.)     Specifically, I'm looking at the Axion electronic switcher, because it seems to be fairly cheap.  (About $128 at MacZone.)     Does anyone know anything about it?  I've heard that with most of these things you can still only use 2 serial ports at a time, it just prevents you from physically swapping cables.  Although I've also heard that programs that use the Comm Toolbox may be able to use as many serial ports as they want; does anyone know if this is true with the Axion switchbox?     Finally, if the Axion stinks, or if you're using something else that you think is good, I'd be interested in hearing about other products.  I would like to spend under $140, if possible.

Well, my monitor arrived last night and, sure enough, it has a very noticable barrel distortion. It's not dramatic, but it is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't fill the entire screen. The fact that it is worse on the right side doesn't help matters.  What I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? I don't want to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse problem.

I don't particularly want this discussion to spark a lengthy debate, but I do think it's worth pointing out that \\\"popular usage\\\" is not always sufficient excuse.

Probably not.    The same is true of X.  \\\"The X Window System\\\", \\\"X\\\", \\\"X11\\\", and related monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a proper name.

As for the trade publications that promulgate things like \\\"X Window\\\" or \\\"X.windows\\\" or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees,  consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by  *journalists*.

Tep\",\"04/16/93 1045  ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES  By David Ljunggren  MOSCOW, April 16, Reuter - Armenia accused Turkey on Friday of flying weapons x and troops across Armenian airspace to Azerbaijan and strongly hinted it might try to shoot the planes down, local journalists in Yerevan said.  Separately, Itar-Tass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latest offensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions in the Transcaucasian region soaring.  The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan, head of the Armenian defence ministry press centre, as saying Ankara had been sending  planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops.  It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey about the impermissibility of such actions,\\\" the journalists quoted Duliyan as  saying.  \\\"If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate measures. We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft units.\\\"  Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in the conflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in which more than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.  The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to Azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.  A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly on a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket launchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.  Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops and arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from where they were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku.  \\\"All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the country which is affording military assistance over our airspace,\\\" he said.  Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops  involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.  Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive along the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front.  \\\"The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's) leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire,\\\" the agency said.  Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in Karabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of Commonwealth leaders.  \\\"The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the protection of the Karabakh population,\\\" Tass quoted him as saying.       At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have collapsed.  \\\"The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the legal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh,\\\" he said. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not  been recognised by any other country.  Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future peace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.  Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender Gamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with Armenia, had resigned.  Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office. Khabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of Baku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev. There was no official confirmation.  \",\"The SDIO has \\\"contracted\\\" with the NRL (Naval Research Laboratory) to fly the Clementine Mission.  BTW we call it DSPSE (Deep Space Project Science Experiment).  The NRL is building the spacecraft, designing the detailed mission and doing the integration and operations (with help from, JPL & Goddard & prob. some folks I have left out...don't be mad).  I am on the TAMP (Trajectory Analysis & Mission Planning) team and am responsable for the IV&V of the traj that Goddard/CSC are designing.  As for why SDIO is doing it, some of the reasons are:     1)  the safety constraints are too tight to try to run the LIDAR in LEO     2)  in LEO we don't get any new radiation data on the sensors, we will get        that data on our 9 passages through the Van Allen (sp?) Belts     3)  since we are going out there...why not piggy-back some general science     4)  the intercept problem is a lot easied over LONG distances and LONG times  I am sure there are some things I have forgotten, and some I haven't been told but, those are the reasons we all talk about.  --  \",\"Your \\\"lite\\\" posting for the day, from rec.humor.funny:  -- \",\"  Point your gopher client at merlot.welch.jhu.edu  and select the following directories:   -->  13.

So I put  everything back to the way it was and re-installed the cards.  I then unplugged the floppy drive cable from the disk controller.  Voila!, the PC booted from power up, although it seemed to take several seconds  before the first access to the hard disk.  Plug the floppy cable back to the controller and the original (non-boot) behavior returns.

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper- work, and left for the Zhdanov District. That's in Azerbaijan, near the Nagorno Karabagh region.  After the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically in Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said \\\"uprising\\\" in Azerbaijani, but I don't think it was really an uprising, just a  demonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the  Zhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even  women; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here,  and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There were some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the Armenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site. I was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew  wouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really  bad. I didn't know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me, \\\"There's unrest everywhere, be careful.\\\" Well I had a project going on. I told the Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on  and said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn't allow it, they  said, \\\"Nothing's going to happen to you, we've entrusted the matter to the  police, we've warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.\\\"  Well, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he  knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This man didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and  afterward he spent the night with us, too.  I sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, \\\"The situation is very tense, be careful.\\\"  We finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the morning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I shouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else's business travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it  and my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus,  they sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out  they knew what was happening in Sumgait.  I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is closed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the  buses aren't running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two minutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private drivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, \\\"Let's go find some other way to get there.\\\" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to take us to Sumgait.  He took us there. But the others had said, \\\"I wouldn't go if you gave me a thousand rubles.\\\" \\\"Why?\\\" \\\"Because they're burning the city and killing the Armenians. There isn't an Armenian left.\\\" Well I got hold of myself so I could still stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we  set off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, \\\"In fact there aren't any Armenians left. 'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them.\\\" Well  I was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me,  \\\"How old are you, old man?\\\" He wants to know: if I'm being that quiet, not  saying anything, maybe it means I'm an Armenian. \\\"How old are you?\\\" he asks  me. I say, \\\"I'm 47.\\\" \\\"I'm 47 too, but I call you 'old man'.\\\" I say, \\\"It  depends on God, each person's life in this world is different.\\\" I look much older than my years, that's why he called me old man. Well after that he was silent, too.  We're approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon. Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he was waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I'm sitting there with them, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant there were no Armenians with us.  I look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the  street, you know, and there's no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They stopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature  shafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .  Along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's  not. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I'm an Armenian, but I speak  their language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for  \\\"nut,\\\" or \\\"little nut,\\\" as \\\"pundukh,\\\" but \\\"fundukh\\\" is actually correct. The  pronunciations are different. Anyone who says \\\"pundukh,\\\" even if they're not  Armenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says,  \\\"There was a car there, with five people inside it,\\\" he says. \\\"They started  hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn't let the people out,\\\" he says, \\\"they wouldn't let them get out of the car.\\\" I only saw  the car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from Baku to Sumgait and back . . .  When they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there's a short guy, his eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. \\\"We're Azerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no Armenians here.\\\" He did come up to me when  we were pulling our things out and says, \\\"Maybe you're an Armenian, old man?\\\"  But in Azerbaijani I say, \\\"You should be ashamed of yourself!\\\" And . . . he  left. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had  to . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own  home.  They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that's where the Kavkaz store  and three large, 12-story buildings are. That's the beginning of down-town. I  saw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I  couldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it  was a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing  remained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I saw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About 30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.  I see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are closed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the crowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots. Several shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier.  Someone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the  soldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one  armored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning  off Sumgait.  I walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by  their gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. I joined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us and asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see. But I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly  recognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer people. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block. I can't get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as  to get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking  behind him. And he's shouting into a megaphone: \\\"Comrades, the Armenian- Azerbaijani war has begun!\\\"  The police have megaphones like that. So they're talking and walking around  the second microdistrict. I see that they're coming my way, and turn off  behind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings,  and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every corner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were  doing I can't say, because I couldn't get up close to them, I was afraid. But  the most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least find out if my children were alive or not . . .

My question is:  How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list, where people can ask questions about Motif++, swap stories, and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the user-community, as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project, and this way I can make a list of priorities, in what order things should be added, or changed.

Not that it runs poorly normally, but on these days, it is exceptional.  My theory is that the air density and moisture content of the air are such that I get complete combustion.  Needless to say, it puts me in a great mood.  The mood lasted for about 20 miles.  Heading north on the 405 freeway, about a mile or two south of the 10, my throttle stopped responding.... and I was between lanes.  Nothing to do but make  my way over 4 lanes to the shoulder... initially by gliding, then by pushing.  At least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did not mind stopping for me.  Turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS40  carb.  I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws tight on a bike, but I never thought that I had to do that on the screws inside of a carb.

IBM:  equivalent to the 486sx except it has a 16k on-chip cache.  * ex. for 486dx2/50, chip runs 50 MHz rest of machine runs at 25 MHz. ***(PC Week 04/12/93; PC Mag 4/27/93:138) \\\"The latest in a line of CISC chips\\\"  (PC Mag 4/27/93:110)  Samples released March 22, 1993, but machines will not  be announced until at least May 1993 (PC Week 2/08/93).  $1000 a CPU; systems  $5000 and up (PC Mag 4/27/93:110).

CPUs Comparison List As a general rule of thumb Motorola chips are faster than Intel chips at the  same frequency {030/25 ~= 386/33; 040/25 ~= 486dx/50}, but Intel has chips at  higher frequencies than Motorola, so this evens out.  The Macintosh Bible 4th  ed. supports the comparisons between Intel and Motorola chips for the 68020  and above.  <=80186    ~ 68000 {16-bit vs 16/24/32-bit chip [data path/address  lines/data & address registers].  The 4MB limit on the 68000 Macs brings it  down to the 80186 and lower chips, otherwise it would compare to the 80286.}  286        ~ 68020 {hardware segmenting vs. 68020's 32-bit ALU and these chips  come have no usable built-in MMU unlike their successors [80386, 68030].  The  hardware segmenting's protected mode is used by OS/2 1.0 => and Windows 3.X.  The use of the hardware segmenting and their 16-bit nature put the 286 between  the 60000 and 68030 in features and the LC's 16-bit data path strenghthens the  286 ~ 68020 comparison.}  386       ~ 68030 {Two 32-bit chips with MMUs, and protected memory.  A/UX 3.0  is at present the only Mac OS to use the 68030's protected memory feature for  apps.  System 7.x uses this feature to protect a RAM disk created by the  Memory control panel but this is supported only on Powerbooks and Quadras.   The Color Classic and LCII 16-bit hardware data paths makes the 68030s in them  comparative to 386sxs.}  486sx   ~ 68LC040 {same as 486 and 68040 without the FPU; used as a low cost  solution for people who do not need the FPU.

These chips may flounder against the cheaper (PC Week 3/08/93;  4/12/93; PC Mag 4/27/93:110), earlier released (PC Week 12/7/92; MacWeek  12/14/92; PC Week 2/08/93), less leat producing {160 degrees F for Pentium (PC Mag 4/27/93:118)}, and partly ported to PowerPC chips.}   PowerPC   = PowerPC {This CPU line is planned to run programs from DOS,  Windows 3.x, OS/2 and Mac OS on top of PowerOpen-A/UX 4.0 [UNIX] and later  Pink [Taligent OS] by using emulators or, if necessary, the OSes themselves in  a 'shell' a.k. how SoftPC or OS/2 does DOS.}  Hardware  {In an effort to remove the 'reconfiguring the system almost every time you  add something' requirement for add-in cards, drivers, video, and operating  systems in the IBM world, Intel, Microsoft and 12 other hardware and software  developers are working out 'plug and play' standards (PC Week 03/08/93).} Color Support/Display  Mac: 30.24 MHz Pixel Clock standard.  All present Macs support the use of  32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw  allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y- bit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y  independently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63  dpi [12\\\" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including  autosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz  vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser  Aug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and  IIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit  color (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).   To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display  capability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit  color.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX  will change this. In addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one  monitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same  thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree  of overlap of the pictures. VRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of   built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit  color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display.  Sound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became   standard with the SE/30.  IBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system  interacts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing  BIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation of clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program  interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer  Jawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a  standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is  actually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like  Mac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes,  especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present  things are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver  and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS,  and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with  an IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2  486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0  and still have ALL the colors one started out with}. Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster  processors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD  ROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).   MDA: Monocrome Display Adapter  original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text. CGA: Color Graphics Array  320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes. EGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array  640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions   could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes. VGA:  Video Graphics Array*  320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are   the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a   18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock  (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals  from EGA/CGA etc.  MCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*  subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA   and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).    Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models. SVGA:  Super VGA*  This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch   all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer   using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating  as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a   standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things  are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution  of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since   1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600,   some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually   at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital   Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example],   some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting   factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were:   8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a   64K \\\"window\\\", etc. Other non-SVGA standards:  8514/a:  IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions   like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations   from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do   not have interlacing.  TMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some  do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD. XGA:  eXtended Graphics Array  newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones   are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at   1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes. XGA-2  Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in  Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area  fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-  exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be   far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth   isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other   companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh   rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual   discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2. *some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.  Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software  drivers.  \\\"Fast SCSI-1\\\" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode  {see SCSI-2 for details}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast  SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in    hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are  4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and  15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can  use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such  is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called \\\"fast SCSI-1\\\".   16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics  but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a  different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which  makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}. Mac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though   Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager  needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI  interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast   asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2  controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1))   though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port   interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus   Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some  Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard   and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager. IBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with   systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.  Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers  out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications  which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.  Mac Memory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin   8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs  could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity   feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx   used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new   72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.  The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every  memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will  not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.  Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs   had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris   650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that   allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same   size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting   in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109). Printers, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard. Monitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs.  PDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE,   Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.    Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650:   4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with  the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in   IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows   through put down. NuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,  and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:  40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and   Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a   Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet   to DMA. NuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:  ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7\\\" instead of the   old 12\\\". QuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's   VLBus - \\\"Architecture is identical to that of VLBus\\\" (Byte 10/92:128).  Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development. CPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,    Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at   the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to   dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each   NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with   8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.  IBM Memory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac- like SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.  HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:  MFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited  only used with smaller [\\u00b2 60mb] hard drives. IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.  currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive.  ESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface  ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in  many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of  hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1.   BUS interfaces {New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working  with old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).} ISA  8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a  16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).  1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,  hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards  aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}  while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's  showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit  (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.   MCA {Micro Channel}  IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; \\\"allows use of more than one CPU in a computer\\\"   (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components   involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA   and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido). EISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}  32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to   self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable   interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use. VESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}  Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}  250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus   mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for   video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of  their patents (Mel Martinez). QuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture  (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines  (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development. PCI  Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace   ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.  OSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.] and multiple application use.} Mac 512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows  Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw,  menu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require  clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires  access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM  chips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support  interface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS  has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and  therefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control  over hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with  some of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a  totally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon  Wtte). 6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy,   cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.    Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program   interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of   AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a   24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as   real RAM is below 8MB. 6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers. 6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X. 7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard   to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present   non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on  system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking   within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing   can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be   accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X},   Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable   IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType   support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present   machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is   both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit   mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last   'free' OS. 7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than   7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode   on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension.   Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades  {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.  [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system   fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any   RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all   fonts from the system file.] A/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and   a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS   is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac   ROMs.  Price: $709. Note: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats  including the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and  DCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd'  and AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most  still play.  IBM  Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for  programmers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.   Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition,  what little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}   This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or  EPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to  better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which  is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it  reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware  support is needed. Side note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing  all feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing  its Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 (\\\"Undocumented Windows\\\") and  \\\"There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to  abort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present\\\" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92  #201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC  judicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no  action.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of  choosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has  turned down Microsoft's copyright of \\\"Windows\\\" which would allow it to charge  a fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93). MicroSoft OSes DOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier   with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program   must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS   Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit   Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in  DOS 4.0. DOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk   defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for   networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99}   (Byte April 1993:44-46). DOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93). Window 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to   deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to  run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the  equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].  This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac  programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and  still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed  is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).  Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS  counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108). Window 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base   requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx.   Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92). Windows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).    Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1   with built-in peer to peer networking support. Windows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the   swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in   the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the   reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM   but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).  This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric   multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in  networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even  though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor  is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993  (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993  (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495  (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93). Other OSes PC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS   6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93). DR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression}   and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later   version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple   file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92). OS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,  60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded,   multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file   to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}.   IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this   (InfoWorld Oct 26/92). AIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS. NeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final   version to be out by May 25, 1993. Solaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric   multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with   tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and   communication package.  Client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users  server: $5,995.  Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195. Mac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel   Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM   (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run   on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps   will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to   Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow   progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in   late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}  PowerPC Rumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92;  MacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA  video (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week  3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps. Apple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and  to have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to  sale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser  9/92:146)} (MacWeek 3/22/93). PowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on  PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain  (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard  drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.  Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993. Pink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92)   and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and   PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93). Windows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details. Solaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the  Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state   that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details NeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.  OS Number Crunching (Mel Park) Mac  Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard  Apple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an  FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or  taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are  handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal  representation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment  of 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and  the FPU programmed directly.  IBM  Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when  emulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever  compiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers  exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS  prompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this  better.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS,  Windows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.  Networking [Includes printing] WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially  if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer. Mac Hardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.   LocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for  each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to  include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in  Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at  about $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and  transceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet. The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet  interface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a  network option since 1989. Software: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can  use variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS  as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open,  Banyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing  machines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows  typical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version  will have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993  (MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC  Pathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software  built-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra.  Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in  the chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the  chooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers. Printing bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.  {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}  IBM   Hardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing. Software: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk  protocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}. Each of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible  with the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to  that product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more  forgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest,  {~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and  offers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more  complex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac  finder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;   InfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93) Printing {Very OS dependent} DOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port,   and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written   software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly   implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one   software program to the next. Windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing \\\"jobs\\\"   in the print queue, but it always lists printers as \\\"active\\\"... even if they   are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers   on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine   which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like   and intelligent about this. OS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS. Printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do  not have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and  not that of the OS involved.  Price issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features  than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars  by both worlds. The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware  standarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to  handle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac  hardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,   built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and  NuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent  equipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs  which cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.  Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993. All Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.  Except where  noted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card  needed except for 24-bit color display}. IBM planned a $1,200 386SLC/25MHz model with a 60MB hard drive and color VGA  monitor {~VRAM} (MacWeek 8/17/92) {sounds like a Color Classic without SCSI-1,  sound support, built-in network support, FPU socket, built-in expansion to  16-bit color, etc}. Color Classic:  $1,389 - 030/16MHz with 16-bit data bus {~386sx/20MHz  equivalent}, 4/80, FPU socket, and built-in monitor. LCIII: $1,499 - 030/25MHz {~386dx/33MHz equivalent}, and 4/160. Centris 610: $2,899 - 68LC040/20MHz {Depending on the program ~486sx/40 or  ~'486dx2sx'/20[40]MHz equivalent}, 8/230, built-in ethernet, 300i CD-ROM, a  PDS/NuBus 90 slot and VRAM for 16-bit color. Centris 650: 040/25MHz {Depending on the program ~486dx/50 MHz or 486dx2/50  MHz equivalent} with a PDS and 3 NuBus 90 slots. $3,189 {ethernet, 8/80};  $3,559 {ethernet, 8/230}; $3,999 {ethernet, 8/230, CD-ROM, VRAM for 16-bit  color}  Bibliography notes 'Vaporware' is available in the digest/vapor directory by FTP on sumex- aim.stanford.edu [36.44.0.6] and was by Murphy Sewall {last issue: April 93.} 'Info-IBMPC Digest' back issues are available from wsmr-simtel20.army.mil in  directory PD2:<ARCHIVES.IBMPC> 'Dictionary of Computer Terms 3rd ed.'

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean an \\\"air core resonant transformer\\\". The TV flyback version Tesla coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called \\\"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit\\\" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors, which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat, gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and telegraph for communication.

For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.  To speak about POVRay, the X previewer that comes with the original source package is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness and ICCCM compliance. Have a look on x256q, my own preview code. It is on  141.76.1.11:pub/gfx/ray/misc/x256q/  The README states the points where it is better than xwindow.c from POVRay 1.0 \",\"I'm having trouble receiving News at the moment due to an overloaded News server.

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)? * What are the US export regulations? * What is TEMPEST? * What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax? * What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch? * Is RSA patented? * What about the Voynich manuscript?   * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?    The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It   was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and   has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is   known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,   and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the   world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of   cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many   years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break   many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national   security almost all information about the NSA is classified.    Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of   the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the   difference between public and private research in cryptography:    ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,   one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted   behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged   today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of   those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10   years has there in fact been widespread open research in   cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts   between these two research communities. Open research is common   quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open   exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in   scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with   responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,   countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can   a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might   undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?   One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would   force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one   must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with   political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most   scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have   occurred between government agencies and open researchers in   cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which   we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''  * What are the US export regulations?    In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control   export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export   Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by   the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office   of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized   by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule   of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent   requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see   everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.    The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting   discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what   people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which   go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to   consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in   jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at   least heard of the ITAR.  * What is TEMPEST?    TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer   equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that   information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at   quite a distance and with little effort.    Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext   is available this way.  * What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?    (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for   corrections.)    The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas   Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass   of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving   three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the   location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.   Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;   it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the   Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;   many documents have been tried as the key to B1.    Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various   means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:    The Beale Cypher Association   P.O. Box 975   Beaver Falls, PA 15010    You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the   line:    send index    in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.   (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher   floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,   says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)    Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of   problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI   and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.   Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this   string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an   explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this   string.  * What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?    The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis   on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with   pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes   articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in   English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,   Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.    Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;   less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent   to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.  * Is RSA patented?    Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.   For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been   granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral   issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information   about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of   the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as   ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other   technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.  * What about the Voynich manuscript?    nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the   subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list   is: <voynich-request@rand.org>    the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich\",\"I have a wonderful Commodore 128 for sale!!!!

(Sorry all HP fans, but I have a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their (excellent) gear).  One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is whether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock the instrument into real time capture mode.   I agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus. However, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students) seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or more knobs required of a \\\"real\\\" scope :-)   This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at least they appear to be logically laid out.  One more thing about the new, \\\"simpler\\\", front panels. These instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the instruments.

My suspicion jumps to this damn all in one HD controller/serial/ parallel/game-port I/O card, or to the motherboard (God forbid).   CAN ANYONE HELP?\",\"  No. The issue is reducing crime, not guns. If gun control doesn't lower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue.   Does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much more common? Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the threat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim  in an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not be as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually _use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.) It isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a knife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more common. That's why it is important to look at the overall (not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of substitution, different criminal techinques of using different weapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.   \\\"Face\\\"? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn't too common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the usual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts to much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your pockets. Overall, I'd much rather be threatened with a gun than actually stabbed with a knife.   Actually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training in unarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman  without much problem.  You also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National Crime Survey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a knife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives in a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almost all prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore, using (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case) a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless of how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effective than guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a \\\"serious threat\\\" nearly as often as they do guns.\",\"Could some kind soul out there e-mail me the 411 on where I can find the mlb.c   program?

It would be stupid to rely on even a \\\"Clipperized\\\" channel for truly  sensitive material, but it *does* seem to finally offer a reasonable way to  guard against casual eavesdropping.  For example, even with my strong \\\"right  to bear arms\\\" view of the private right to possess and use strong  cryptosystems, the system as described provides enough security that I would  actually buy a cordless phone, and would be much less wary of using cellular  phones, walkie-talkies, and so on.  As long as it's only used for mass-market  voice scrambling, I actually don't see a problem with it.  If you want more security than it offers, use something different.  Use PKCS  for electronic mail, CELP over DES or triple DES with Diffie-Hellman key  exchange for your voice traffic, or whatever.

Neil Smith                             WEIRD SCIENCE  Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips  move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are  politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase  \\\"political science\\\" is subject to more than one interpretation.    Years ago, we heard how \\\"scientists\\\" were worried that a new Ice  Age might be coming, and later on that \\\"nuclear winter\\\" -- smoke  and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international  unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even  have killed the dinosaurs.    What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this,  that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended  to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken  values that made America the most successful culture in history,  and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague  when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.    We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William  Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't  supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least  100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never  know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit  their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and  that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.    But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of  science as they are of everything, they trust \\\"scientists\\\" to  unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \\\"scientists\\\"  have agendas of their own.    Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is  going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that  there is no respectable evidence for \\\"global warming\\\".  The money  and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and  they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical  crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.    The same appears true of \\\"acid rain\\\", a deliberate hoax cooked up  by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private  industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and  foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on  specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.    The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.   \\\"Ozone depletion\\\", for which evidence is even more suspect and  contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than  a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era  when state central planning and the command economy have failed and  can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.    Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth  and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear  power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy  known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount  of energy there is available to any individual in society, the  freer that individual -- and his society -- become.    Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and  self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as  ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive  reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have  been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.    And what the media didn't say about recent EPA \\\"discoveries\\\" on the  effect of \\\"secondhand smoking\\\" is that, although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of  magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a  week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether  there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.    That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically  correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice  to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy  practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's  science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is  highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet  the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There  isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of  government money on the scientific establishment.    Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies  to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one  time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and  religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has  tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of  abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street  -- has wound up being shed.    Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's  lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of  livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate,  to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels  for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates,  when they die from the effects of obesity.    What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two  more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of  state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable;  real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will  simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and  everyone will benefit.    L.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display ==========================================================  PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software) ======================  IMDISP ------   IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,   enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS   data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions   [PC and Macs]  LabVIEW 2 ---------   LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   \\\"program\\\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even   hole filling.    The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.    GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,   documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been   developed by Spyglass.

It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,   tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting   things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of   images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined   convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw   data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also   does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,   though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac   that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version   from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)  PhotoMac --------   Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700  PhotoPress ----------   Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973  PixelTools and TCL-Image ------------------------   \\\"Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications   software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,   blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,   EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,   PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the \\\"auto selection tool\\\"   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close   hues, color range and mask.

Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283  Digital Darkroom ----------------   The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and   editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by \\\"painting\\\" it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator \\\"paint\\\" with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd., Suite J San Diego, CA   92126 619-695-6956  Dimple ------   It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or   II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram.

Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: \\\"Laplacian, medium noise filter\\\", etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,   the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu   (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)   Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,   VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic, etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is   available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - \\\"AIPS++\\\" - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and   Australia to name a few.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using   the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,   automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to   byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically   and carefree.    It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that   difficult to write your own with their programmer's module.    Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for   a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000   with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display\\\"  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil   exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual   pages, and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.   For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun   console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X   windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of   convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]    MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,    byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or    without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,    line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp    masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,    line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan    bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to    region target mean, median, or modal value. o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,    brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive    background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical    aperture shape to image isophotes.  o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot    of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`    centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,    change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and    adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function    or histogram equalization. o  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for    registration. o  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or    2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers    can be cycled through. Interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting,    point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and    quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights    or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass    back to calling function. Dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars)    to file or printer.  Change to user specified coordinate system. o  Tricolor image combination and display, hardcopy halftone printout to    HP-PCL compatible printers (Laserjet, deskjet, etc.) o  Documentation is over 300 pages in custom vinyl binder.

My 1975 Saab 99 didn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In addition to the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another set integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who don't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic growth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out of the front fender, which incorporated amber \\\"parking lights\\\", amber side marker lights/reflectors, white \\\"cornering lamps\\\" (like American luxury cars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators on, and white \\\"backup lights\\\" aimed towards the back of the car when you have selected reverse gear.

I suppose you could linearize it in software, but the real problem is that the precision of your measurement is no longer constant (higher voltages would be more precise).  On the other hand, I could be wrong and perhaps the game card designers splurged for the extra $.50 to make a cheap constant current source out of an op amp.  But I wouldn't expect that...\",\"I would like to see Christians devote a bit less effort to _bashing_ paganism and more to figuring out how to present the Gospel to pagans.

Otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix.   An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always   available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community, however, I'm not   really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting   (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, C library or compiler patches come   out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for   all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license.   Hence, Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.

Straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments.  So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to image.

Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript. It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation processed PS.  The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.  We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's demo though).

In fact, for the Bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use.  The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.  It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo- Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man.  This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers have done).  Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I think the important aspect is the result.

Press-Democrat, April 15, 1993, p. B2:      Male sex survey: Gay activity low      A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough     examination of American men's sexual practices published since     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and     1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.      The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday     by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than     the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional     wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.  The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners. The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3. Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson, and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general male population.  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.\",\"Can anyone help me find any information on the drug Prozac?

We always came home with a nasty case of jiggers (large red bumps where the buggers had burrowed into the skin). My mother would paint the bumps with clear finger nail polish. This was repeated daily for about a week or so. The application of the polish is supposed to suffocate them as it seals of the skin. All I can say is it worked for us. One word of caution though. Putting finger nail polish on a jigger bite stings like hell.  (If I do get flamed for this just put jam in my pockets and call me toast.:) \",\"   The word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the \\\"B\\\" word, or the \\\"H\\\" word, or even the \\\"N\\\" or \\\"W\\\" words. It is the \\\"L\\\" word - LOSER !!   That's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it is all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.   Remember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail buffer can claim they are \\\"too young\\\" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet. The eighties were about \\\"How America Learned to Win Once Again\\\". Then (wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win. No Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer (We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no holds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a few \\\"little\\\" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an S&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to contend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never had it so good.    In the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one doesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a \\\"kinder and gentler type of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of discourse about people who \\\"don't get it\\\". For those of us in the winning business, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no  suggestion of losing.   But what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our  \\\"white male\\\" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out  photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one with a \\\"Hail Mary\\\" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'three yards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses in the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the  weapon of choice these days.     Who is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on  your face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This  is known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt  sure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the  same. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to  take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?   What we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is  the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood used to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott declaimed, \\\"Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will  not tolerate a loser.\\\" And so on.    The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and Democrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some  \\\"equitable\\\" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a  loser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian homosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%)  minority.   Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most conservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care who's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say something about make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition). In the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a  \\\"neoconservative\\\" or a \\\"neoliberal\\\" depending on how much you want to limit the pot.   Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be popular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still be popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I  would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it is the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any other place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in Columbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to  see more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious  preference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of  them be white men !!

Fred is basically correct:  no sophisticated tools, just a lot of effort and painstaking care.  But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (He also noted that the software people were starting to feel management pressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)  Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get things right for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failure during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure. As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be counted on one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.  As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software.

If neccesary I could post these tools or where to get them by FTP -- let me know. ------------ Part 1 of 14 ------------ begin 644 ROMAN.BMP M0DT:S0@``````!H#```,````P`-8`@$`\\\"``H,%4L*%DX2%G*E95(4'U9:8&% M@?HT-%T,,$A`55U]?>K*=769QLY(1,Y9<77*RLJJUN(P/%UI@8D8&%E(3%D0 M/%VZNKI55?)U@<[*JJH42&U$55DH*'&RVOH857T0/&$X4%6-KL:JSOH@>;:) MB>HT/%D42'%=7<Y$1'V9F?_*B8DL,%D858&=KO^-MKH<89&5H?_*:6DDA<HL M,%W*OKX8584\\\\2&%U<?I$0%DT-'$<896%H<X@;:7*G9V-I>)(684D>;8<89FA MI:65NM9QA;(@;:H\\\\2&G*?7UYB<8D>;IYD;8T1%G&QL9E=94HA<H01&504(59 M5?\\\\H)%W*LK*VMK9978E]A?I,55DHA<XP,&'&^OI$2%F)D?(44'G*D9%]F:%E M8?HP.%5(885,68FAMOIM>;+*<7'*QL:VXO\\\\878V5G>Y`4%UA<84<:9TX1%T0 M.%EU?<K*I:441&D<::$84'E`/%D@(%T@=;(X,%E,887*A84D@<*)F?(84'V^ M]OHX3%5(76EU=>(@*%!I;;(D(%4@=;8<78W*966AQNK\\\"PL(D@<;*NKJ1B?]] MH:5MA=XHC=8P0%D<79&RLK)5685]>?HL+%T@::$\\\\/'&1D?+*F9F9LO^!E>I0 M4*6AH:$\\\\,%EM:>J5KN)A8;I(4%D\\\\1&6=LO;*>7EI=:ZZZOH,-%`X.%E$4&DT M-*&EOOH00&&=NNHLC=;*KJZZZO\\\\43'&5I?I9686ESMZRYNX00&5$/&6JVNX4 M3'7*C8T<'%G2^O^!D<X8685$1%EIA9D43'DX0%7*;6W*PL*VWOH868E`3%F^ MOKX<99DT2%5M:?](2'U588U(65TP-%D@<:K*H:&!H;8\\\\55FNKJY]?=HD?;H< M99TX0%V9I?^-KJZESNX@<:Y95=+*@8&1NKYM;<IA=7DD?;Y56:55896-KK(H MB<YUD9U077E096E$0*6RTOK*MK8X0&6^\\\\OI(4'FJQOJ9QL8HB=*9D?](2/(` M``````````````````````````````````````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`=]W=0$E)W4!W=W>%W=UWW7=)=W=`=W=W M2>-`A4!)2>/C=W?CA>-)=^-)22-WXTE)XTGCXX6%0.-)0$!)X^-)X^/C2>/C MXTE[X^/CXTGCX^/C>^/CX^/CBDF*24E[BN/7XXKCBN.*BN/CX^-[XXKCXWLR MX^/CBHJ*,GOC>S).>^/C,HI.XS**,GN*3GN*BDXRBHI8,GN*6(I8BHJ*BC(R M6(J*>S**BDXRBHI.,O/S3DY.Y_-.BN=.,HJ*6//G\\\\_.*,DY8YS)8Y_-8\\\\TY.

Here is some  information \\\"from the horse's mouth\\\".  (Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (\\\"clearing\\\") meant to  be *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying  the material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,)  From National Telecommunications and Information Systems  Security (NTISS) \\\"Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation  Security Guidelines\\\"  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87):  ------  \\\"7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk,  cassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the  entire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be  cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that overwrites  each location with a given character.  Fixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting  at least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by  applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each  location on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that  this program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware:  some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not  actually do this.  Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or  released for destruction; however, they should be marked and  controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of  information ever recorded.  7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a  degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of  that type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)  If a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is  operative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to  employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all  addressable locations at least three times by writing any character,  then its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros)  alternatively.  When fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify  the media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two  alternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk  pack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved  degaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the  vendor's facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter)  removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for  destruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new  platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.  7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media\\\"  [see DoD Computer Security Center, \\\"Department of Defense Magnetic  Remanence Security Guideline\\\", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE  ONLY]  ------  This and many other interesting documents (many that are more  informative than probably intended) on computer security procedures  can be obtained (free) from:  Executive Secretary National Telecommunications and Informations   Systems Security Committee National Security Agency Fort George G.

Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS/2 2.0 any longer. If you wish to install the beta from the CD/ROM, you will need to REM out the Adaptec device drivers, as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic cards when OS/2 attempts to use them. (Thanks Adaptec!)   So you add the BusLogic drivers to the config.sys on the CD-ROM boot disk, and REM out the Adaptec drivers.  Then you install the whole 1st half of the Beta.. and it won't work! IBM nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again. (Thanks IBM!) So.. REM out the Adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot. If you have everything in the right order.. it will work.  Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except OS/2 will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end... so.. you are off to more REM statements and more fun.   The BT 542Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that do not come with drivers. The DOS drivers work great. This card can easily be configured to work with 8 different sets of I/O ports (and you can use multiple host adapters in one machine) If you get a new card.. it will also be able to support up to 8 GB drives under DOS.

I merely said that he isn't the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor. If Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup by now- probably more than once.  If he was as great a GM as you claim and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success. But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM so none of this is true anyway.\",\"   A human has greater control over his/her actions, than a  predominately instictive tiger.

My opinion, FWIW, to all:  Mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las Vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major league hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have the league data from the mid-80s to check it out.  That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers, they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around .220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on the Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at any level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.

Granted, I thought his behavior with McCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first time he ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But he has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more valuable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24), had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor, EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF (which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching his \\\"prime\\\" season of 27. He should be considered as a legitimate prospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.

So you say palestineans do not negociate because of 'well-founded' predictions ? How do you know that they are 'well founded' if you do not test them at the  table ? 18 months did not prove anything, but it's always the other side at  fault, right ?  Why ? I do not know why, but if, let's say, the Palestineans (some of them) want ALL ISRAEL, and these are known not to be accepted terms by israelis.  Or, maybe they (palestinenans) are not yet ready for statehood ?  Or, maybe there is too much politics within the palestinean leadership, too many fractions aso ?

All Scripture is true, being inspired by God.  The evidence for this claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group.  Similarly, all truth is absolute.  Indeed, a non-absolute truth is a  contradiction in terms.  When is something absolute?  When it is always true.  Obviously, if a \\\"truth\\\" is not always \\\"true\\\" then we have a contradiction in terms.    Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a statement is terribly self-contradictory.  Let me put it to you this way.  If there are no absolutes, shouldn't we conclude that the statement, \\\"There are no absolutes\\\" is not absolutely true?  Obviously, we have a contradiction here.  This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming that there are indeed absolutes in the universe.   So?  People sometimes disagree about what is true.  This does not negate the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  Moreover, evangelical Christianity, at least, still professes to believe in certain truths.  Man is sinful, man needs salvation, and Jesus is the propitiation for mankind's sins, to name a few.  Any group that does not profess to believe these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical.  \",\" The ADC is an organization of Arab-*AMERICANS*.  Let me see...you're saying that \\\"most if not all\\\" Arab-AMERICANS should be spied on?  You're also saying that \\\"most if not all\\\" Arab-AMERICANS should be views as a national security threat to Israel (and the US,  as you gratuitously imply in your reference to the WTC bombing, in  which no Arab-AMERICANS were involved)?  By inference, can we assume  that you think that anyone of Arab lineage anywhere in the world poses  a threat to Israel and, therefore, should be spied on?  Perhaps, then, on the basis of Pollard spy case (not to mention the Rosenbergs, etc.) you think that all Jewish Americans should be spied  on by the ADC.  Oh, never mind; this whole spying case has obviously so  convoluted your sense of right or wrong in these matters that I have  no wish confuse you further.

If his conscience forbade him to go to war in Vietnam, it should forbid him to perpetuate this system of government-sanctioned slavery.

An anyway, couldn't the jobs be replaced by improving our domestic situation?  (I'm not for continued deficit spending, but if Clinton and Congress want to spend, I'd rather they improve the  infrastructure than fight other people's wars.)   A novel idea:  Getting away from naval bases, what about refurbishing decommissioned Air Force bases as airports?

The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically modified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks. Later model 2600 might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weight of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.  Additionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM for their games. I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I would hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. Think comes from a lot of hacking with the 800 and 130xe computers. And occasionally hacking with the 2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups). Also I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM into a RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way to backup cartridges). I've heard of a setup like this where games could be bought (cheaply) on FSK-recorded tapes, then you would load them into a special RAM cartidge, and play them.

The question you ask is complicated and deserves an honest answer. I am going to provide one from my own current perspective, not a historical one.  Currently, as a non-observant jew/Israeli/American, my own feeling is that Jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in Palestine or Israel, than the palestinians or Israelis (both arab and jew) do. With regard to Jewish Israelis, they should have the same rights in Israel as do all other Israelis.   Who are them?  If by them you mean the non-religious Jews, I think you should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their supporters are religious.  The other part of the problem is, to my knowledge, not that the palestinians don't want to be a part of Israel, as much as they would accept (for the most part) being full citizens of Israel, with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded Israeli citizens.  What they object to is the current limbo in which they find themselves.  \",\"  Be warned, it is not my job to convert you.  That is the job of the Holy Spirit.  And I, frankly, make a lousy one.

Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft), and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.  How about measuring vertical distance as well, any chance - or am I getting ridiculous?  What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call Japan, etc.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would greatly appreciate your sending it to me.  Thanks.\",\"   Just as a matter of interest, a self-promo computer graphics sequence  that one of the local TV stations used to play quite a lot a couple of years ago showed a 3D flyover of Australia from the West coast to the East.  The clouds were quite recognisable as fuzzy, flat, white Mandlebrot sets!!\",\"  First of all, I resent your assumption that you know why I am threatened by science, or even that I am threatened at all, although I admit the latter.  The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence-- God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree, Science.   My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations, for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone. Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have  children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that is made possible.   People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death, and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world.   This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely  prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary  alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,   go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us?   I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not, but I will say this:  Before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body they have been given, they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to  believe their search is displeasing to God.\",\" They detect the oscillator operating in the detector.

Sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long, and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique. Or so I thought.  I went to Tuesday's game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the 'Stick was  a much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but  everything is a lot better. The lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms are CLEAN and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite.   The new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fence are very nice, as are the new bleachers. The bleachers start right at the top of the fence and give a great view, and they've got beer stands at the bottome of the bleachers. The only complaint is that the electronic  old-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better.  These things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real  businessman (ex - Safeway President Peter Magowan) to figure it out.

Most of these quotations are of people who do beleive.  People who would try to justify their own positions.  Second the logical proof:    The period of time that has elapsed from the event growing larger does not increase the odds that a hoax would be discovered.

If most people }use scissors to cut paper, shouldn't Consumer's Reports }test scissors for paper-cutting ability, even though }scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?  That's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching Jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version is what was \\\"enlightened for its times\\\". To (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for their times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even heard of paper.  I'm not arguing that the Bible is \\\"disgusting\\\", though some of the history depicted in it is, by modern standards.  However, history is full of similar abuses, and I don't think the Biblical accounts are worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  On the other hand, I don't know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries, or ours.  That complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting, but I still don't think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history.\",\" :  really involved there).

I agree completely, driving drunk is really stupid, and I understand and appreciate that you feel bad about it.  But DWI is endemic in our society.  It is a REAL problem.  And we, as  motorcyclists, can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk driver.  (Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI accident (right bloody in front of me), and was unable to save the life  of one of the participants, as I reported here.)  Also, drunk driving by motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death, which raises the insurance rates, forces stupidly restrictive laws, and turns the public against those of us who ride responsibly.  In my view, drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence. It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue, but a genuine safety issue.  So if YOU bring up the subject on rec.moto, admitting having been caught DWI, and looking for sympathy over the  consequences, don't expect people to respond with warm wishes.\",\" Oh, that must explain Matthew 18:  1) In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, \\\"Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\\\" 2) And he called to him a little child, and set him in the midst of them, 3) and said, \\\"Verily I say unto you, Except ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. 14) Even so it is not the will of your father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.

Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; you shall not do any work - you, your son or daughter, your male or female slave, or your cattle, or the stranger who is within your settlements. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth and sea, and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and hollowed it.

The sad truth is: sometimes that is good, or at least, better than the alternative.   Ok.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the number has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these accidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.  ...  In fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that.  The idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber handgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense, would, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't why I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it, and might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to kill people.   In fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses of firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer not to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what you say when you point a gun at them.  If you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to immediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work the best.[3]   Certainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing) aren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of them were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with having deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to use deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right, but my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and knowing how to use the tools to do that.  \\\"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\\\"  - T. Jefferson.  I think what Jefferson said is still true.   Not very often compared to other use.[3]   This isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly \\\"get-pissed\\\" and kill someone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long histories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these people wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.   Right, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I never have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from rodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than is necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them to drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that, I don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and ammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm after, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point, people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns, particularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.

In 1932, the accidental deaths by firearm per  1,000,000 people was 24.03. In 1987, it was 5.74. The decline has been  steady, consistent, and a fairly straight line when plotted. At the rate  of the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD.  CONCLUSION ========== Firearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over  sixty years, despite rising per-capita gun ownership.    [1] = Year. [2] = Population. [3] = Accidental deaths. [4] = Accidental deaths per 1,000,000.

THe purpose of the group will be to provide help to people who use Access's  WYSIWYG design tools to create simple databases as well as to people who use  Access Basic to create complex databases.  RATIONALE: Eventhough Access is a new RDBMS, it is very popular because of its Graphical Development enviroment and its initial low price.

In case of the Earth z is about 23.5 degrees, I think. I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus, z is almost 90 degrees.  u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured. Paris is at about 45 degrees.  North pole is at 90.  a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from 0 to 360 degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun. The spring equinox occurs at a=0.  L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day). On the equator (u=0) L is always 1/2.  Near the north pole (u=90 degrees) L is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.  Computation: Define the auxiliary angles p and q by: sin p = sin a sin z cos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       (0 < q < 180 degrees)  Conclusion: L = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees) L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)  Wait!

How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the person claiming to be IT is obviously insane?  I'm not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ.  How could somebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming?  Koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast.  He didn't.  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people.  And, from my meagre knowledge of the Bible, it seems that Christians have been hard on the Jews of Christ's day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the Messiah.  So I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the Second Coming while, at the same time, not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God.  [Mark 13:21   And then if any one says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!'  or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.

My understanding of Jesus' answer is that, unlike his first coming, which was veiled, the second coming will be quite unmistakeable.  He's telling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen before his second coming -- the actual second coming will make his power openly visible.  By the way, from Koresh's public statement it's not so clear to me that he is claiming to be Christ.\",\"Jonathan E.

In retrospect I would also like to quote another source: Douglas C. Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_  THERAPY INEFFECTIVE  Recently the founders of yet another prominent \\\"ex-gay\\\" ministry, Exodus International, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective. Michael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and lovers for 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The program was described by these men as \\\"ineffective . . . not one person was healed.\\\"  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed \\\"reparative therapy.\\\"  The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June 30, 1992 called \\\"The Ex-Ex-Gay\\\" by Robert Pela.  Some personal thoughts:  It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among its ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even later, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and segragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings. Today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is still coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind control, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than God sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt thier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \\\"physically\\\" forced to stay in this \\\"reparative therapy\\\" but sheer social pressure is enough for many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.  As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution against gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by the contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live, not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t a clue what is in their heart.

Today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique I'd never seen before.  He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil. The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray, made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.  In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.  On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.  Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises and concerns me are:  1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?  2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color     (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring     agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected     it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,     caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being     used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?  3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated     as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract     from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever     happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea     could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do     so.  WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens), I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips, getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process, then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.  My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff, just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?  I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.  And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually has some standing, don't know about the others.\",\"Since the losers that sold me the hard disk for my computer are so generous, I need the info to set this drive from master to slave.

Without delving into a deep discussion of : >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code : >>perfect and without flaw.  : >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~  Do you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and has degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement, shouldn't we?  Perhaps the biggest \\\"imperfection\\\" of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains.  Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes.   On the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted later, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused, if introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated, since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are conserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and these are not found in or near intron sequences.   I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting \\\"theological arguments\\\" like this.  Try Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish & Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.  : Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does : God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a : theological perspective -- my own.

Would you please cite a few references that support your assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective, unless you support it by some evidence.  In fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we've thought - for instance, sex might have evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by computer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.)    : Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma : rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.

I'd replace \\\"created\\\" with \\\"formed\\\", since there is no need to  invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one. Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8 billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.

I hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests  everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against this conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in  anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the  right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so, and not to present one's own conclusions prior to this.   Theology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions.  : >>Human DNA, being more \\\"complex\\\", tends to accumulate errors adversely : >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the  : >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  : >>causing infection and disease.

Bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators from degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to  survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it  to the present.   And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection, and thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either claim.   : But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in : answering John's question of why?

The problem is, it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution.  : Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference. : Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the : point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I : never said that people are \\\"meant\\\" (presumably by God) \\\"to be : punished by getting diseases\\\".  Why I did say is that free moral : choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject : God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not : expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic : universe.  I am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone. I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.  What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?    : Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).

This is why we recommend these books.  Is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence for this? If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al) suggest, why do people still insist on this?   : Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.

Claiming that that truth is absolute, though, seems  to imply a literal reading of the Bible.  If it were absolute truth  (constant across time, culture, etc.) then no interpretation would be  necessary.  It may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different  from person to person.  To me, that doesn't mean that one person is  right and the other is wrong.  I believe that God transcends our simple  minds, and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly  this intent.  God knows me, and knows that my needs are different  from yours or anyone else's.  By claiming that scripture is absolute, then at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong. I just don't believe that God is that rigid.   This is where the arrogance comes in to play.  Since these principles  are crystal clear to evangelicals, maybe the rest of us should just take their word for it?  Maybe it isn't at all crystal clear to *me* that  their fundamental principles are either fundamental *or* principles.

Maybe to a certain  segment of Christianity, but to all.   Not at all.  I think it supports my position much more effectively  than yours.  :-)  So, I think that your position is: The Bible is absolute truth, but as we are prone to error in our  interpretation, we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out  what that truth is. Did I get that right?  What's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending  absolute truth, when we can never know what those truths are, and we  can never (or at least shouldn't) act upon them?

It was quite a while ago. \",\"[..] Referring to the manual of my motherboard with AMI-BIOS, 10 beeps are a  'CMOS Shutdown Register Read/Write Error', if the system stops after these beeps. If the system continues, it is a 'Keyboard error'.  Michael\",\"    Syria had been bombing Israeli settlements from the Golan and sending terrorist squads into Israel for years.  Do you need me to provide specifics? I can.  Why don't you give it up, Hasan?  I'm really starting to get tired of your  empty lies.  You can defend your position and ideology with documented facts and arguments rather than the crap you regularly post.  Take an example from someone like Brendan McKay, with whom I don't agree, but who uses logic and documentation to argue his position.  Why must you insist on constantly spouting baseless lies?  You may piss some people off, but that's about it.  You won't prove anything or add anything worthy to a discussion.  Your arguments just  prove what a poor debater you are and how weak your case really is.\",\"It was a gift from God.  I think basically the reasoning was that the tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus. As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.) Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition because she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.  Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She  refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old  would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.  RCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, that being Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.  In this case, mostly

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger    economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a    lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,    but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing    military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than    just a \\\"we have the money, why not?\\\" approach.  Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European cooperation.  Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of money (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at the size of that multiplier :->).\",\"      1. Dont rely on benchmarks. They often show incorrect due to different    TSR programs.  2. SCSI often needs a driver to get the speed from the card.  3. Make sure the card is operating in synchronus mode which is 2x faster.  4. You can disable disconnect and get some kB/s but just to loose the mouse    or other int`s when diskaccesing.

Look at the whole picture, not just randomly picked libertarian positions.  If government is not allowed to use \\\"non-initiated force\\\" to achieve its goals, than no special interest can influence the government to use non-initiated force on their behalf.  The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic which I'll address briefly.  It certainly won't happen until libertarianism is the dominate philosophy.  What means do we have to make libertarianism the dominate philosophy?  Statists run the education monopoly, so we have to be creative.  The Advocates for Self-Government reports 85% of their Seminar 1 participants \\\"embrace\\\" libertarianism. That's the best means I've seen yet.

A few weeks ago, she noticed that some of her hair was starting to fall out.  She would touch her head and strands of hair would just fall right out. (by the way, she is 29 or 30 years old).   It continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the size of a half dollar.  Since that time, she  has gotten two more bald spots of the same size.  Other symptoms she's described include:  several months of an irregular menstrual cycle (which is strange for her, because she has always been extremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wake up one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next day it's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or 5 very bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one that knocked her to the ground; and general fatigue.  She went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reason for the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected thyroid problems.  He did the blood work and claims that everything came back normal.    She's very concerned and very confused.  Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions?  I told her that I thought she should see an endocrinologist.  Does that sound like the right idea?  ** By the way, in case you are going to ask...no, she has recently taken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no, she hasn't recently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm,  coloring, or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall out.\",\"  Krillean photography involves taking pictures of minute decapods resident in  the seas surrounding the antarctic.

The Leafs could not be faulted, as they completely dominated the inferior Detroit squad and clearly deserved to win.

Alan\",\" I finished reading a very good book, \\\"The Will of God\\\", Weatherhead. This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the will of God.  Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts; intentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He (Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael Parkin above quite nicely.  Summarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, God's ultimate will is never to be defeated.  God's intentions may be interfered with, even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by circumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all humankind) will never be stopped.  Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of this process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God's intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and deviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3) Despite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in the Cross, as Jesus willingly (\\\"not my will, Lord, but yours\\\") died for the redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant, overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances.   It was not the intentional will of God.  It was the circumstancial will, thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will.    Right, intentional will.  (Just like the Jewish people  We know neither the time nor the place.

It is an S3 86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my second meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from them, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say \\\"Buy the memory from us\\\" or something like that.)   The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a 1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256. Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I asked them why, and all I got was \\\"Your point is well taken, but Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects.\\\"   So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805 drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're broken.   If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805 cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are \\\"less busy\\\".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805 product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?), although evenn that might be a misprint.   Please, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out there, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.\",\"Well, it seems the \\\"National Sales Tax\\\" has gotten its very       own CNN news LOGO!

There are a miriad of factors for  each individual. As we are all different, we quite obviously require  different levels of evidence.   As one pointed out, one's history is important. While in FUSSR, one  may not believe a comrade who states that he owns five pairs of blue jeans.  One would need more evidence, than if one lived in the United States. The  only time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the US, is if the  individual always wear business suits, etc.   The degree of the effect upon the world, and the strength of the  claim also determine the amount of evidence necessary. When determining the  level of evidence one needs, it is most certainly relevent what the  consequences of the proposition are.     If the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, please explain  why one would not accept: The electro-magnetic force of attraction between  two charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their  distance apart.    Remember, if the consequences of the law are not relevent, then we can not use experimental evidence as a disproof. If one of the  consequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of  affairs, or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law,  they are irrelevent when theorizing about the \\\"Truth\\\" of the law.   Given that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, including  the consequence of self-contradiction or contradiction with the state of  affiars, how are we ever able to  judge what is true or not; let alone find \\\"The Truth\\\"?     By the way, what is \\\"Truth\\\"? Please define before inserting it in  the conversation. Please explain what \\\"Truth\\\" or \\\"TRUTH\\\" is. I do think that  anything is ever known for certain.

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the system key   2) Recieve Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number      is necessary for local operation).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large, making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.  IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number.\",\"  Gifts of the Spirit should not be seen as an endorsement of ones behavior. A lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs.  Jesus said that people would come to Him saying \\\"Lord, Lord,\\\" and proclaiming the miraculous works they had done in His name.  Jesus would tell them that they were workers of iniquity that do not know Him, and to depart from Him.    That is not to say that this will happen to everyone who commits a homosexual sin.  If the Holy Spirit were only given to the morally perfect, He would not be given to me, or any of us.  God can forgive any sin, if we repent. But people should be careful not to think, \\\"God has given me a gift of the Spirit, it must be okay to be gay.\\\"  That is dangerous (see also hebrews 6 about those who have partaken of the Holy Spirit and of the powers of  the world to come.)   Jesus doesn't ask us to change our own nature.  We cannot lift ourselves out of our own sin- but we must submit to His hand as He changes our nature.  Practicing homosexual acts and homosexual lusts violates the morality that God has set forth.    If you don't believe that, and think those of us who do are just ignorant, then at least consider us weak in the faith and be celebate for our sake's. Is practicing homosexuality worth the cost of a soul, whether it be the homosexual's or the one considered \\\"ignorant?\\\"\",\"  My, this distinction seems quite arbitrary.    Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered.   (Ps. 32:1).  and quoted by the apostle Paul:    Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God   imputeth righteousness without works,   Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins   are covered.   Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  (Rom. 4:6-8)  The biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are parallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments.  The dispensational distinction is unwarranted.   I'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  You're suggesting Jesus is going to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- for millions perhaps billions of people.  Such activity for Moses the lawgiver was considered unwise (cf. Ex. 18:13ff).  It makes for interesting speculation, though.  I'll leave comments on the so-called \\\"bema seat\\\" vs. \\\"throne\\\" judgments to someone else.  This also seems like more unnecessary divisions ala dispensationalism. \",\" Excuse me but... have not all Macs got a CPU!!!\",\"   Sorry, but I think this interpretation of the Matthew 13 parables is nonsense.

[Quotations omitted.  This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]  There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the \\\"Annunciation\\\" by Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28   And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto  a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a  man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's  name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\\\"Hail,  thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed  art thou among women.\\\"_  Now, now, hold that line of thought - \\\"the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women\\\" - while you read on....  In the book, \\\"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of Devotion to Mary\\\" by Peter Lappin:  The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible that the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title \\\"The Conception of Saint Anne\\\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary is the incorruptible timber \\\"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christ's sinless body\\\"; she is \\\"God's Eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\\\"  Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus, she was hailed as \\\"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\\\". ... At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a  greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_. ...  Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. From \\\"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\\\" by John A. Hardon:  Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism. Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).  Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall: In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over: -They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the  power to think and to choose freely. -The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality  and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. -They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,  the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding  title to enter heaven. By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely.  Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day...  Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ (I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):  Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born  AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was: \\\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst women\\\".  Even Mary was confused about this greeting.  Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (Adam and Eve before their sin):     Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)     Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)     The Lord is with you (At those times, God would                 definitely want to be with those He                 has made _blessed_)     Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)  At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body of Christ and so,  Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart. \",\"   It seemed pretty conclusive to me.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.       WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE      Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     \\\"scooped\\\" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study, Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:         Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year    Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year    Shuttle sources:   725,000 kilograms/year      The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \\\"the bends\\\", certainly some     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,     you're dying. The limits are not really known.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School     of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.       HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED      The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin     team's medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team     examined them, they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE \\\"FACE ON MARS\\\"      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

What have they changed from the F550i?   Do you know if their is going to be a new T560i soon? (a T560iW?)\",\" Even if what Brad says turns out to be accurate, you can bet that the Administration will have made it \\\"very clear\\\" to the vendors that \\\"it would very much be in their best interests\\\" to institute a \\\"voluntary\\\" policy of refusing to sell anything but Clinton Cripple equipped equipment to anyone other than \\\"Authorized government agencies and Law Enforcement\\\", or individuals and corporations who \\\"have been been determined by the Administration to have a valid need on a case-by-case basis\\\" for an effective system.  Note that this is very much like the language used in many gun control bills/laws the Administration is pushing for, or otherwise supporting. The logic and actual rationale (as opposed to the excuses that get fed to the media) is the same in both cases, only the items or technology in question are different.  I think this is no accident.  It comes from the same philosophy that the government rules/controls the people, not the people controlling the government, that the unconnected citizens are not sophisticated enough to know what is best for them, so the government must tell the people what they need or do not need ... \\\"we know best...\\\".  And the idea that that a commoner can defend himself against government eavesdropping or unlawful attack is totally unacceptable to people with this outlook.   Combine this all with pushing for national identity cards with 'smart chips' to encode anything they please (internal passport) under the guise of streamlining the State People's Health Care System, and with (you can be certain) more jewels yet to come, and one sees an extremely ominous trend.  So what if \\\"1984\\\" will be ten years late... it still is turning out to be an amazingly accurate prophecy... unless a LOT of people wake up, and in a hurry.  One should ALWAYS have every red warning light and bell and danger flag come up when the government seeks to set itself apart in regard to rights, etc.  from the unconnected/unprivileged citizen (or should we now be saying 'subject' instead?)...

SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it. There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and the software.  THAT IS IT. Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.  SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}  asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}  synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a  rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}  SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from  SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs  this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers  AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the   slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode   4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous  mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}  SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things  over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the  machine and the external device.  Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver  software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.  Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.  SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this  requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING  devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY  expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts  \",\"\\\"Chimney Sweep\\\" number 12/I (5-1/2 to 6-1/2\\\"), closed edition, 3 or 4 line (Purchased in West Germany in 1970) (Retail $270) Sell $120 (S&H extra)  I have a picture of it if you want to see first; in excellent shape, no chips or cracks).

They may take Pronger, except that they already have too many defensive prospects.\",\" I will clarify my earlier quote.  God's laws were originally written for  the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made obsolete by Jesus.  If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, He also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived interpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their heads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom of Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin. They had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the letter of the Law but never really believed in it.    I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?  Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will. Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.

For anyone who didn't see Sunday's game,  With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform, a left handed hitter and play jordan and gilkey, both right handers.  Later, in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford, a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis Alicea, a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter.  What the Hell is he thinking.  Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt, But torre said he liked Gilkey coming off the bench.  Gilkey hit over 300 last year, what does he have to do to start, The guy would be starting on most every team in the league.

That is--you get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree    to escrow your key. Otherwise you are on your own.  That's the disturbing part - use of other products IS voluntary, for now, and the press releases talk about the White House's unwillingness to decide that citizens have a right to good commercial crypto gear, and about how commercial alternatives will be permitted as long as they provide key escrow services.  That's a clear implication that they're considering banning alternatives.  Additionally, use of real alternatives ISN'T totally legal - you're not allowed to export really good crypto equipment except to the government's friends (e.g. the Australian government) you can only export even BAD crypto equipment with their permission, and the regulators who control the cellular telephone companies make sure there are only two competitors, so Joe's Garage Cellular can't start offering a secure service.  \",\"Heise model 710A pressure meter.

Although I can't prove that a god doesn't exist, the arguments used to support a god's existence are weak and often self-contradictory, and I'm not going to believe in a god unless someone comes over to me and gives me a reason to believe in a god that I absolutely can't ignore.  A while ago, I read an interesting book by a fellow called Von Daenicken, in which he proved some of the wildest things, and on the last page, he wrote something like \\\"Can you prove it isn't so?\\\" I certainly can't, but I'm not going to believe him, because he based his \\\"proof\\\" on some really questionable stuff, such as old myths (he called it \\\"circumstancial evidence\\\" :] ).

Ring structures for benzene had been proposed before Kekule', after him, and at the same time as him. The current models do not resemble Kekule's.  Many of the predecessors of Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more.  I don't think \\\"extra-scientific\\\" is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational is a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.  For example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a friend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but Pasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking at the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.  Again, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers (tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the \\\"Newton of mirror-image life,\\\" which he never admitted publically.  Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery started this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile and Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice. Most of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the student.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which the student eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the research program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery (Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\",\"Just to shed some light on the fire, it was widely reported (AP, etc.) that there WERE several witnesses to BD folks starting the fires.  It has also been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once, which rules out a Bradley knocking over a lamp, etc. as the cause.  What I would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident.  I believe the moves made were right and proper, but I still have some problems with some of the tactics.  After watching the ABC special on it tonight, as well as CNN and Nightline, I question some of the ATF and FBI actions.  1) Could it have been possible to have taken Koresh outside the compound at some time before the Feb. 28th raid?  2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.  3) Were FBI actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the \\\"right\\\" course of action?

A true fan of a  team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.    Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans supported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of  detracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what  happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly  not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all, remember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that far, let alone beat Baltimore.  Let's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football and Basketball.  Because of this, one can never say with absolute certainity what the outcome will be over the course of 162 games.\",\" Try Cables and Chips ... let me dig out a reciept ...  Here we are...

Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production( toxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well  because of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got  into Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium  would prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here. But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6  supplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).  Vitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams  per day).   1. Review Article \\\"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney      stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\\\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.     5(3):110-129(1985).  But glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both  glycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this  production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine,  but to increase your intake of vitamin B6.   2. \\\"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in       patients with kidney stones\\\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)      200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary       excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.   3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\\\" Clin. Sci. 38     :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day      showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.  For gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is  required for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for  oxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is  quite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.   The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40%  of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable  and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto  6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic  acid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the  extra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a  very early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.  Med. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day  increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg  per day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was  increased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose  and 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion  before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average  before supplementation.  B6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There  are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about  yet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the  speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must  have an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then  explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C  challenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your  intake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you  take vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient  in B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate  kidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets  absorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day  showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309 -15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase  in urinary oxalate excretion.   Here are the high oxalate foods:   1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.     Contain at least 25mg/100grams   2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale,      peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.     Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.  If the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot  of latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points  out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your  intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being  absorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn't  have to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for  males and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake). B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more  per day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).    The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day  for males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with  this low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6  requirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that  either block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6  excretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol, isoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to  supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that  increase the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking  birth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the  other drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your  dietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone  formation should be given B6 supplements.  One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your  Ca/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is  calcium-oxalate.   4. \\\"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of  patients with calcium oxalate calculi\\\"Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)   5. \\\"Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the  crystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium  interaction\\\"J. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990).   6.Review Article, \\\"Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment  of renal calcium stones\\\" J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).  There are actually about three times as many articles published in the  medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone  formation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in  stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier  post in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I  guess that he doesn't read the medical literature.  Oh well, since kidney  stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them, I thought  I'd tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor's office.

What  was he killed for. He hadn't hurt anyone, hadn't said any word he oughtn't  have. Why did they kill him? I want to find out--from here, from there, from  the government--why my husband was killed.  On the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home. He doesn't work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, \\\"Mamma, is  there a soccer game?\\\" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That's where we  lived. I say, \\\"I don't know, Igor, I haven't turned on the TV.\\\" He looked  again and said, \\\"Mamma, what's going on in the courtyard?!\\\" I look and see so  many people, it's awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands,  you can't even tell how many there are. They're shouting, \\\"Down with the  Armenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!\\\" My God, why is  that happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together well, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely  unexpected. And they were shouting, \\\"Long live Turkey!\\\" And they had flags, and they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he's  around 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I  can't make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something, and the children behind him are shouting, \\\"Tear the Armenians to pieces!\\\" and  \\\"Down with the Armenians!\\\" They shout it again, and then shout, \\\"Hurrah!\\\" The  people streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I  saw that there were women, too. I say, \\\"My God, there are women there too!\\\"  And my son says, \\\"Those aren't women, Mamma, those are bad women.\\\" Well we  didn't look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I  simply couldn't sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani  neighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \\\"Khalida, what's going on, what  happened?\\\" She says, \\\"Emma, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what  happened.\\\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks,  each second or third one had a white rod. They're waving the rods above their  heads as they walk, and the one who's out front, like a leader, he has a white stick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I  don't know.  My husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \\\"Oh  dear, I'm frightened, they're going to kill us I bet.\\\" And he says, \\\"What are  you afraid of, they're just children.\\\" I say, \\\"Everything that happens comes  from children.\\\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and  Vocational School. \\\"Don't fear,\\\" he said, \\\"it's nothing, nothing all that  bad.\\\" He didn't eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they broadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran.  When I heard that I couldn't settle down at all, I kept walking here and  there and I said, \\\"They're going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to  kill us.\\\" And he says, \\\"Don't be afraid.\\\" Then we heard--from the central  square, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shouting different things, and you couldn't hear every well. I say, \\\"You speak Azerbaijani well, listen to what they're saying.\\\" He says \\\"Close the window and go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\\\" He listened a bit and then  closed the window and went to bed, and told us, \\\"Come on, go to sleep, it's nothing.\\\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window until two in the morning watching. Well he's sick, and all of this was affecting him. I say, \\\"Igor, you go to bed, I'm going to go to bed in a minute too.\\\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed.  Things had calmed down slightly.  The 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \\\"Come on, Emma,  get up.\\\" I say, \\\"Today's my day off, let me rest.\\\" He says, \\\"Aren't you going  to make me some tea?\\\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \\\"Where are  you going?\\\" He says, \\\"I'm going out, I have to.\\\" I say, \\\"Can you really go  outside on a day like today? Don't go out, for God's sake. You never listen to me, I know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take  the car out of the garage, go without the car.\\\" And he says, \\\"Come on, close  the door!\\\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn't make it out, he probably said \\\"coward\\\" or something.  I closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up around the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after- noon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said, \\\"Khalida, was it our car?\\\" She says, \\\"No, no, Emma, don't be afraid, they were government cars and Zhigulis.'' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited, it was four o'clock, five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven I said, \\\"Oh, they've killed Shagen!\\\"  Tires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and I'm afraid, I'm  standing on the balcony and I'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God,  they've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten  o'clock and he still hadn't come home. And I'm afraid to go out. At ten o'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore, and from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside.  I'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I  don't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see  it. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \\\"Mamma,\\\" he says, \\\"look what they're doing over there!\\\" They were burning everything, and there  were police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing  on the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are  throwing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony  is shouting, \\\"What are you standing there for, burn it!\\\" When they threw the  television, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out  on her balcony and shouted, \\\"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those things, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their  home. Why are you burning them?\\\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \\\"Go  inside, go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in  your building or not?\\\" They meant Armenians, but they didn't say Armenians,  they said, \\\"of them.\\\" She says, \\\"No, no, no, none!\\\" Then she ran downstairs to our place, and says, \\\"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\\\" I say, \\\"They've killed Shagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won't be living for me without  Shagen. Let them kill us, too!\\\" She insists, saying, \\\"Emma, get out of here,  go to Khalida's, and give me the key. When they come I'll say that it's my  daughter's apartment, that they're off visiting someone.\\\" I gave her the key  and went to the neighbor's, but I couldn't endure it. I say, \\\"Igor, you stay  here, I'm going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa's . . . Papa's there.\\\"  Meanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and  Valery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in  the courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling,  and I didn't think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived in the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw an Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \\\"Madar,  Uncle Shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the  garage, let's at least bring the corpse into the house. \\\"He shouts, \\\"Aunt  Emma, where do you think you're going?! Go back into the house, I'll look for  him.\\\" I say, \\\"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar,  I'm coming too.\\\" Well he wouldn't let me go all the same, he says, \\\"You stay  here with us, I'm go look.\\\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \\\"Aunt  Emma, there's no one there, the garage is closed. \\\"Madar went off again and  then returned and said, \\\"Aunt Emma, they're already killed Alik, and Valery's  there . . . wheezing.\\\"  Madar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \\\"Don't go near him,  or we'll put you next to him.\\\" He got scared--he's young--and came back and  said, \\\"I'm going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take  Alik, maybe he'll live . . . \\\" They grew up together in our courtyard, they  knew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but not a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and  called, and called, and called--nothing.  I went upstairs to the neighbor's. Igor says, \\\"Two police cars drove up over  there, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still  lying where they were, they're still lying there . . . \\\"We watched out the window until four o'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn't take my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six o'clock in the morning I got up and said, \\\"Igor, you stay here at home, don't go out, don't go anywhere, I'm going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or alive . . . let me go . . . I've got the keys from work.\\\"  At six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another  doctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \\\"Doctor, is  Shagen there?\\\" He says, \\\"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\\\" I  wanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. There were only four people in there, they said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. They said, \\\"Shagen's not here, he's alive somewhere, he'll come back.\\\"  It's already seven o'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck with three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with them. I say, \\\"Sara Baji [\\\"Sister\\\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they've probably brought Shagen.\\\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back and says, \\\"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it's a younger person.\\\" Now Shagen  just happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they  said it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \\\"Doctor, they've  brought Shagen in dead.\\\" He says, \\\"Why are you carrying on like that, dead,  dead . . . he's alive.\\\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back  the look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They knew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \\\"Doctor,  is it Shagen?\\\" He says, \\\"No, Emma, it's not he, it's somebody else entirely.\\\"  I say, \\\"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I'll find out all the same anyway,  if not today, then tomorrow.\\\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the office. He says, \\\"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\\\" Another one of our  colleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous  condition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't Shagen. A few minutes  later another colleague comes in and says, \\\"Oh, poor Emma!\\\" When she said it  like that there was no hope left.     That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured  people.  At night someone took me home. I said, \\\"Igor, Papa's been killed.\\\"  On the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital:  I had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is  surrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \\\"Hey, citizen, where  are you going?\\\" I say, \\\"I work here,\\\" and from inside someone shouts, \\\"Yes,  yes, that's our cook, let her in.\\\" I went right to the head doctor's office and there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to work with us at the hospital. He says, \\\"Emma, Shagen's been taken to Baku. In the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\\\" I say, \\\"Doctor, how will I bury him?\\\" He says, \\\"We're taking care of all that, don't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. Where did you spend the night?\\\" I say, \\\"I was at home.\\\" He says, \\\"What do you mean you were at home?! You were at home alone?\\\" I say, \\\"No, Igor was there too.\\\" He says, \\\"You can't stay home, we're getting an ambulance right now, wait just one second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance right now, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here like a patient, and you'll stay here and we'll se~ later what to do next ...\\\" His last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor's name is Izyat Jamalogli Sadukhov.  The \\\"ambulance\\\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a  patient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the  hospital until the 4th.  Some police car came and they said, \\\"Emma, let's go.\\\" And the women, our  colleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \\\"Where are  you taking her?\\\" I say, \\\"They're going to kill me, too . . . \\\" And the investigator says, \\\"Why are you saying that, we're going to make a positive identification.\\\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I still can't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \\\"Let's  go, we need to be certain, maybe it's not Shagen.\\\" And when I saw the caskets, lying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \\\"I can't look, no.\\\" The investigator says, \\\"Are there any identifying marks?\\\" I say, \\\"Let me see the clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I'll recognize them.\\\" He says,  \\\"Isn't they're anything on his body?\\\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his  finger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had been injured at work . . .  They brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they  brought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \\\"Oh,  they burned him!\\\" I shouted, I don't know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat  down, I don't remember. And that investigator says, \\\"Well fine, fine, since  we've identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since he has seven gold teeth . . . \\\"  On the 4th they told me: \\\"Emma, it's time to bury Shagen now.\\\" I cried, \\\"How,  how can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he's sick? I should inform  his relatives, he has three sisters, I can't do it by myself.\\\" They say, \\\"OK,  you know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they  get here from Yerevan? There's no transportation, it s impossible.\\\"  He was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in  Sumgait. They asked me, \\\"Where do you want to bury him?\\\" I said, \\\"I want to  bury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\\\" I'm  shouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \\\"Do you know what  it means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\\\" I say, \\\"What do you mean,  arson? Don't they know what's going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that they killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don't have anyone  anymore.\\\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He says, \\\"Let's bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year,  if it calms down, I'll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \\\"  Our trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the investigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then at the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime.  Then they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said,  \\\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\\\" He says, \\\"Yes.\\\" \\\"Well look, here you're  describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\\\" He says,  \\\"Yes.\\\" \\\"And now you're telling it differently?\\\" He says, \\\"Well maybe I  forgot!\\\" Like that.  The witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going along Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a  Volga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were  involved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it's unclear who--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side of the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports  jacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \\\"What's your nationality?\\\" He  says, \\\"Armenian.\\\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \\\"If he's an Armenian, kill him, kill him!\\\" They started beating him, they broke seven of his ribs, and his heart . . . I don't know, they did something there, too  . . . it's too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he  had an armature shaft. He says, \\\"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush,  that's where I got it.\\\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he had already had it. He said, \\\"I hit him twice,\\\" he said, \\\" . . . once or twice on the head with that rod.\\\" And he said that when he started to beat him  Shagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said,  \\\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment, killing someone,\\\" he says, \\\"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or not?\\\" I said, \\\"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you came back to hit him again?\\\" He went back and looked and he was already dead. \\\"After that,\\\" that bastard Tale said, \\\"after that I went home.\\\"  I said, \\\"You . . . you . . . little snake,\\\" I said, \\\"Are you a thief and a  murderer?\\\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They were taken. He says he didn't take them  When they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was other people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned it, that hasn't been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \\\"How can you  have the trial when you don't know who burned the car?\\\" He said something, but I didn't get what he was saying. But I said, \\\"You still haven't straightened  everything out, I think that's unjust.\\\"  When they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him.  In the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80 percent of his body . . .  And I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good  craftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his  own hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the  time. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the  Army. And now they're fatherless...  I couldn't sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15 years' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn't know what to do with myself, I said, \\\"How can that be? You,\\\" I said, \\\"you are  saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years'  deprivation of freedom?\\\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \\\"Let me at that creep, with my bare hands I'll . . . \\\" A relative restrained me, and there were all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,\\\" This isn't a  Soviet trial, this is unjust!\\\" That's what I shouted, l said it and left . . .  I said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street,  they were shouting, \\\"Long live Turkey!\\\" and \\\"Glory to Turkey!\\\" And during the  trial I said to that Ismailov, \\\"What does that mean, 'Glory to Turkey'?\\\" I  still don't understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet  Union. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still don't understand why \\\"Glory to Turkey!\\\" I asked that question twice and got no answer . . . No one answered me . . .

Continuum is another mathematical concept (based on infinity) used to explain things in a certain way.   I have a pretty good idea of what infinity is.

SUG's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible service and value-added to our members.  Last year, the SUG 1991 disk contained plug-and-play X11R4, 20MB of additional essential binaries, almost 200MB of Sun patches, fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net postings, priced at only $250.  Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be produced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added as possible.  To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk set, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the second available later in '92, containing more SPARC binaries and other useful material not found on previous disks.  The SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce, contains a lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great service to make it available right away to our members (and this pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a SUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live within the US or $55 outside.  The SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used by PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a total of 543MB of material, including:  X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after the initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0 distribution are included (109MB of material).

Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that  black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars, M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking appoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time, they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any of these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of the galaxy.           Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the various satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either Pion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our catalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic distribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of homogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE. Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I suppose you are saying, \\\"Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the disk.\\\"  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an  analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile away sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different, and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe find a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.           I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As I said before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short timescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of behavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources. When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk, but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources  in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of these characteristics.  \",\"  Not necessarily.  It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence. There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and Alomar is not a home run hitter.   Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.  Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.  Regarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players with different strengths and a bright future. \",\"}start her up and rev to about 3000 rpm....I FAIL cuz I register 120 DB, }and the max allowed is 110!

These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me.  1.      Is it true that many arab countries don't recognize Israeli nationality ?  That people with Israeli stamps on their passports can't enter arabic countries?  2.      Is it true that arabic countries such as Jordan and Syria have undefined borders and that arab governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of their states should be?  3.      Is it true that arab countires refused to sign the Chemical weapon convention treaty in Paris in 1993?  4.      Is it true that in arab prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ?  4a. Is it true that some arab countries, like Syria, harbor Nazi war criminals, and refuse to extradite them?  4b. Is it true that some arab countries, like Saudi Arabia, prohibit women from driving cars?  5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the Muslim countries are subject to different laws than Muslims?  6.      Is it true that arab countries confiscated the property of entire Jewish communites forced to flee by anti-Jewish riots?  7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed a chemical weapons treaty that no arab nation was willing to sign?  8.      Is it true that Syrian Jews are required to leave a $10,000 deposit before leaving the country, and are no longer allowed to emmigrate, despite promises made by Hafez Assad to George Bush?  9.  Is it true that Jews in Muslim lands are required to pay a special tax, for being Jews?  10.     Is it true that Intercontinental Hotel in Jerusalem was built on a Jewish cemetary, with roads being paved over grave sites, and gravestones being used in Jordanian latrines?  11.

: First off they could recognise Iraqu's responsibility in initiating the : Iran/Iraq war. Providing technical assistance to Iran to get it's oil : production back up to capacity would also be a smart move, at the moment  : Iran is above it's OPEC ceiling. If they had extra capacity they would : use it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests.  I agree with most of what Phill says, except the point about it being in our interests to bring down the oil price.  Consider that both the U.S. and Great Britain have domestic sources to partly satisfy  their energy needs.    Pricy OPEC oil impacts both Germany, Japan and many other \\\"industrial rivals\\\" more than these two.   In addition, the proceeds from the sale (especially by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait U.A.E. etc) are disproportionately reinvested in the U.S. and G.B.,  propping up these economies and further providing an incentive  to keep prices from falling too low.\",\"Scoring stats for the Swedish NHL players, April 5:  ===================================================   Mats Sundin watch:     Most points during a season:       131  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1980-81  (49+82)     110  Mats Naslund, Montreal Canadiens   1985-86  (43+67)   * 109  Mats Sundin, Quebec Nordiques      1992-93  (43+66)     106  Hakan Loob, Calgary Flames         1987-88  (50+56)     104  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1982-83  (46+58)      99  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1984-85  (37+62)     Most goals during a season:       50  Hakan Loob, Calgary Flames         1987-88      49  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1980-81      46  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1982-83      45  Tomas Sandstrom, LA Kings          1990-91      43  Mats Naslund, Montreal Canadiens   1985-86   *  43  Mats Sundin, Quebec Nordiques      1992-93     Most assists during a season:       82  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1980-81      67  Mats Naslund, Montreal Canadiens   1985-86      66  Borje Salming, Toronto Maple Leafs 1976-77   *  66  Mats Sundin, Quebec Nordiques      1992-93      62  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1984-85      61  Borje Salming, Toronto Maple Leafs 1977-78      61  Thomas Steen, Winnipeg Jets        1988-89   Ulf Samuelsson watch:     Most penalty minutes during a season:    *  243  Ulf Samuelsson, Pittsburgh Penguins   1992-93   (through 3/25)      211  Ulf Samuelsson, Pittsburgh Penguins   1990-91      206  Ulf Samuelsson, Pittsburgh Penguins   1991-92      184  Kjell Samuelsson, Philadelphia Flyers 1988-89      181  Ulf Samuelsson, Hartford Whalers      1988-89      174  Ulf Samuelsson, Hartford Whalers      1985-86      170  Borje Salming, Toronto Maple Leafs    1980-81   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  RL Rk Name             Team J# Ps Ht   Wt  Born      G  A  Pts  PL  Comment -- -- ---------------- ---- -- -- ---  --- --------  -- -- ---  --  -------     1 Mats Sundin       QUE 13 C  6-2  189  2/13/71  43 66 109   7       2 Ulf Dahlen        MIN 22 RW 6-2  195  1/12/67  33 38  71   5         3 Thomas Steen      WIN 25 C  5-10 195  6/ 8/60  21 43  64   5     4 Johan Garpenlov   SJS 10 LW 5-11 185  3/21/68  21 40  61   5      5 Fredrik Olausson  WIN  4 D  6-2  200 10/ 5/66  13 38  51   4     6 Tomas Sandstrom   LAK  7 LW 6-2  207  9/ 4/64  22 24  46   2     7 Per-Erik Eklund   PHI  9 LW 5-10 175  3/22/63   8 34  42      Injured     8 Calle Johansson   WAS  6 D  5-11 205  2/14/67   6 35  41   1     9 Nicklas Lidstrom  DET  5 D  6-2  180  4/28/70   7 33  40   2     10 Tommy Sjodin      MIN 33 D  5-11 190  8/13/65   7 29  36         11 Ulf Samuelsson    PIT  5 D  6-1  195  3/26/64   2 24  26   1     12 Mikael Andersson  TBL 34 LW 5-11 185  5/10/66  13 11  24   1     13 Michael Nylander  HFD 36 LW 5-11 176 10/ 3/72   5 16  21   2     14 Roger Johansson   CGY 34 D  6-1  185  4/ 7/67   4 15  19   1    15 Jan Erixon        NYR 20 LW 6-0  196  7/ 8/62   5 10  15          16 Peter Andersson   NYR 25 D  6-0  187  8/29/65   4  7  11   1     17 Kjell Samuelsson  PIT 28 D  6-6  235 10/18/58   3  6   9   2     18 Tommy Albelin     NJD  6 D  6-1  190  5/21/64   1  5   6          19 Per Djoos         NYR 44 D  5-11 176  5/11/68   1  1   2      Binghampton?

This is weird since the Orchid supposedly should be much faster (and I was told by someone that it can do almost 16 kb/s), since the VGA chip is covered by the Orchid label, I can't really tell for sure if it uses a 5286 chip, but the spec. sheet that comes with the board (no docs!) did say it has 1 meg dram and uses a 5286 chip. Winmarks (3.11) is about 4 mil. slower than a Viper (34 vs ~38) using standard palette.

In normal condition, the concentration of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid is about  2 uM that is high enough to activate one type of glutamate receptor-the NMDA receptor. But the question is Neuron and glial cell in the brain have a lots of transport to get glutamate into Neuron or glial. So no one know exact concentration of glutamate is around neurons. \",\" I don't know if this is still true, but at one time Coca-Cola took elaborate measures to keep the formula secret.  For instance, several plants in different cities each made one of six partial concentrates, which were then shipped back-and forth and remixed in a complicated scheme so that no single plant made the whole formula.

Guy didn't hit a lick, had negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield, now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime, he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't  know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field, he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important) was a absolute-primo-dick.    Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.    Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks  (Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been  a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.    You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers, simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you  blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one,  the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should  HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.  Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.    Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?    Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a  good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early 80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer :-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.  Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real stiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory, and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as SS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.    Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a \\\"mediot\\\"  candidate, pushed because of his \\\"winning attitude\\\" (a minor factor, if one at all), and his \\\"great defense\\\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.  SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris' \\\"ability to win\\\" which is nothing more than Morris' \\\"ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\\\".  At this point, Morris is an average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned  close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but not favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF \\\"consideration\\\".    Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about \\\"Yount and Smith being shortstops who  hung around a long time\\\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's  just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre... (Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)  Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY  tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the league.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.   This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it  or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project.\",\"Jason Kratz writing:  ...

So far, no takers. Personally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays, or at least been among the leaders.   Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just one base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.   Wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed. The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays. Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years.   Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances. The Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls in the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great on defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first.   Wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on defense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers some runs.  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average. I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw seem to have come out of theirs.\",\"[followups to talk.politics.guns]  rl> Russell Lawrence kr> Karl Rominger  kr> I support the right of any citizen with out a criminal history to own and     use firearms, regardless of race, gender, and RELIGION.  rl> Thanks for admitting that you, yourself, adhere to an illogical dogma.

Maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted  posts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared private key.  For example at the coming up Cypherpunks meeting, a private key corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out by a moderator.

Communiques intended by the group for non-attendees could of course just be signed using the private key but otherwises not encrypted.  Starting a alt.encrypted newsgroup rather than just maintaining mailing lists is better for several reasons.  First, it would be easier to archive for people who might join a group \\\"late\\\" and who might like to easily read earlier posts; second, traffic analysis to know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled; three, a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicize available privacy measures on the internet.

OK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  They need a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, they now need to      (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of        the key.  Now, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses? Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  State and lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics, while potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost, statutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderately clever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying new phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolen ones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting without a dialing license?]  There's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house,  how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enough safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and  it might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved,  how is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type chip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal Government, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic of the projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of  these kinds of problems will be open for public or \\\"expert\\\" scrutiny?]    Furthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around,  even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be  an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a  key, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political  embarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:      (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and        turns the results over to the NY State Police.  But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton Aid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf war going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case. Now, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have an extra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as another bargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.

Here is a reply to one of the letters.  Seems to me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell!]    Your using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course, in your termonology, God could not \\\"cease to exist.\\\"  However, that is not what death ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see that it signifies \\\"separation.\\\"  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is the reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one member of the Godhead was separated from the other two.    I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived.  She was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my \\\"girlfriend\\\" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were separated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided that she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was death.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not because He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go there.      When I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued on my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and unloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us do as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh.  You have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.     This may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.  Jesus most certainly felt the \\\"pinpricks\\\" of life.  As the Scripture say:  Heb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.  The kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes when He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  \\\"The Consciousness of Christ.\\\"  I have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study, including clh.    It is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually suffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we do.  He \\\"grew in knowledge.\\\"  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose to be taught.  It is my understanding that He was \\\"led of the Spirit\\\" to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and Jesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him, the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise.  That is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was living sequential history as you or I.    Maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not.   I was once a member of that club.  THe \\\"free thinker\\\" is a glorious ideal.  By contrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right.  But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his \\\"rational doubt\\\" when in fact he was led to it by his \\\"faith\\\".  He must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a \\\"free thinker\\\" to criticize the Christian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize him as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.  Pascal pointed out that \\\"sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.  Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.\\\"  The fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms, hence the term \\\"a\\\"-theist.  Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember.  However, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word, every point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.  That is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out \\\"Look, your fly is undone!\\\"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity.  The answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on presuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral.  In other words, another myth.    Presuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence.   Of course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first \\\"Highlander\\\" movie.  But again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of God.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His prophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you are to reject God's annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct understanding of Himself.\",\"I ordered an Intrepid ES on Jan 25th and haven't seen it yet.

Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start azathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.

Years ago in another time and place, I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive engines.  In many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray under the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various floation chambers on each side.  And if you *did* get something there, you'd spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again.  So we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out the dipstick hole.  There was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designed to fit down the dipstick tube, and another, thicker/shorter hose on the outlet side that you put into any convenient container.  I'm sure these gadgets are still available from marine hardware suppliers if you want one.\",\" I wish I could agree with you.  Ask yourself this.  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least partially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly evaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released) The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't.  There is other hardware out there not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)  My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper systems.  If not we're in trouble.  Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like to think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this. They know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken seriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step in the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the \\\"Clipper\\\" system is easily justified \\\"Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying to subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever.\\\" How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system the only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administration knows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for drug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.  Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid. Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations collective I.Q. is about that of a potato.  Why do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big, and NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the stuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why the hell would they jump the gun?   I really wonder.  To wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:  The White House Office of the Press Secretary c/o: Presidential Comment Line (fax) (202) 456-2461   April 17, 1993   Sir and/or Madam:     I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and cryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.   It is apparent to me that those who drafted the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \\\"Big Brother Proposal\\\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep      ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \\\"experts\\\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.   In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \\\"tamper proof\\\" the key escrows might be.   I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti      lize the \\\"Big Brother Chip.\\\"   Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \\\"harmony,\\\" \\\"right to encryption,\\\" and \\\"voluntary.\\\"   It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \\\"I can't believe it's happening here.\\\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \\\"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\\\"           Most Concerned,         [Signature]       Shaen Logan Bernhardt I uni@acs.bu.edu \",\" this borders on blasphemy.\",\"  But what is Hasan B.

By trying to inject the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without adding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could be \\\"Is a polydactyl person a human being?\\\"  You still have not answered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.   You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies. If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule, provide it for me.   More irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does not follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out, brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights of the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant difference.  What I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the thread you started?  You got answers to your questions when you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected, changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion of substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance, why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss silly accussations, e.g. \\\"It really doesn't matter to you...\\\" If it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek some substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic and show some meaning to your words.   As others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on which has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy fails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here. A woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would not be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?   Is it?  Please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.   You simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is not accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on for size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments. But the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The systems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.   Your argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total failure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in reality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible, that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said, you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said, there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to its claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?   You haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.   Again you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and it is not as slow as you seem to think.   Yes, and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that he was murdered by a religious, \\\"pro-life\\\" fanatic.  Please do try to stay relevant.   Clever comeback.  I congratulate you on the readiness of your wit.  What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake? Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What is different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction anyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at parties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.\",\"Ahhh, remember the days of Yesterday?

(now what does require some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation of what's out there....) But there is NO evidence - pro or con - for the existence or non-existence of God (see what I have to say below on this).   Sorry if I remain skeptical - I don't believe it's entirely a conclusion. That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God is correct - neither have I. But lack of evidence for the existence  of something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something  (the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they  disprove evolution the establish creation). You (personally) have never  seen a neutrino before, but they exist. The \\\"pink unicorn\\\" analogy breaks down and is rather naive. I have a scientific theory that explains the  appearance of animal life - evolution. When I draw the conclusion that  \\\"pink unicorns\\\" don't exist because I haven't seen them, this conclusion has it's foundation in observation and theory. A \\\"pink unicorn\\\", if it did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities. That is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from \\\"more primitive\\\" ancestors these pink unicorns would share  a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. God, however, has no such correspondence with anything (IMO). There is no physical frame work of observation to draw ANY conclusions FROM.      I disagree with you profoundly on this. I haven't defined God as existence - in fact, I haven't defined God. But this might be getting off the subject - although if you think it's relevant we can come back to it.    You are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand what I'm saying. I'm making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy. I'm not trying to convince you of anything. *I* Believe - and that rests upon Faith. And it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you that they can logically prove God or that they have \\\"evidence\\\" or ..., then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).  BTW, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not EVEN wrong.    I don't follow you here. Certainly one can make observations of things that they didn't know existed. I still maintain that one cannot use observation to infer that \\\"God does not exist\\\". Such a positive assertion requires a leap.       Once again you seem to completely misunderstand me. I have no EVIDENCE that \\\"'god is' is meaningful\\\" at ANY level. Maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of God down your throat. I, however, am not doing this. I am arguing one, and only one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap - it requires faith. I am, as you would say, a \\\"theist\\\"; however, there is a form of atheism that I can respect - but it must be founded upon honesty.     \",\"    I'm not sure what you mean by 'saving face' unless you are confusing the FBI with the BATF who are the ones who were in charge of the original search warrant.

Some new drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some* track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.  I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.  Hope this helps.\",\"   Marc is not spoofing.

And so, by their own choice, they will remain in darkness, sort of like bugs under a rock.  However, some people, but not many, will not like the darkness.  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable. These people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded at first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  And, after a while, now that they can see things for what they really are, they will also see the heights which they can reach, and the places they can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through the world, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their successes.  They will see that there is much much more to the world than just the narrow experiences under the rock.  They will discover that life under a rock was incredibly yucky, and that life on their own terms is great -- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it.  Do you see my point?  I think you're the one under the rock, and I'm getting a great tan out here in the sunlight.  My life has improved immesurably since I abandoned theism -- come and join me!

Surely if you believe in it this strongly, you must have a good *reason* to, don't you?   When did I say that?  I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead of being subject to the whims of a deity, but that if the deity decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am, then so be it.   Nope -- most people are Christian.  Most people are fond of feeling that they are imperfect, of believing that the world is an undesirable place, of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and holy again, of doing just as their priests tell them, like good little sheep.

D1).  I thought I'd post it to stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by saying that I largely agree that the \\\"Space Age\\\" in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \\\"What's New\\\" - the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of matter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \\\"mind children\\\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do *now*.     Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...   SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW  Micheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)  At 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis.  The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no longer define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion -dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards.    Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science and technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy.    To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead.  .....  Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion to build space station Freedom alone.  Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains, Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken public champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much.  Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar space budgets.  Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.    ......  While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's technological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been slashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions its competitiveness agenda.  ......\",\"You are right in supposing that the problem is with the XmNcolormap (XtNcolormap for truly literate beings) not being set.

Thanks\",\" There is no law prohibiting having biological weapons or nerve gas on his/her property, or even walking on government property with such items: ipso facto it is now one's _RIGHT_ to have such weapons of \\\"mass destruction.\\\"  Hell, the U.S. patent office has patents on the manufacture of nerve gas that anyone can obtain simply by sending a $1.50 to the Patent Office in Washington, D.C. (P.O. Box 8). These same patents are verboten to English citizens from their own patent office, which doesn't surprise me based on the mistrust of the UK government against private ownership of semi-automatic rifles. \",\"Archive-Name: rec-autos/part6  [New article as of 4 February 1993 -- rpw]   Many people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite automotive topics; rather fewer know how to do it.  This article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard Unix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com for a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can list it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the Usenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)  First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin, or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you have trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is probably not good enough.  Listserv:  There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which is available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably  look at listserv carefully.  The Alias file:  On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on whichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:  foo:   bar, baz, bletch   which means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is redistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest possible email list is   my-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address my-favorite-car-request: my-address  this has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can do the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:  my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list my-favorite-car-request: my-address  Where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory, owned by the list admin.  Bounced Mail:  this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating. Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup, by the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)   school-request:   welty school-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list school: \\\"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\\\" owner-school: school-request owner-school-out: school-request   here's what is going on here:  the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail coming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point of contact for administrative duties.  school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses, it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending the email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name; the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the actual list members.  the shell script i use is as follows:  ----------------- #!/bin/sh cd /tmp sed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \\\\         (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          cat -) | \\\\         /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\\                 -F \\\"The ${1} Mailing List\\\" ${1}-rebroadcast exit 0 -------------------  note that this script does not know the name of the list; the name is passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple lists (i run several out of this site.) the script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming message, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to: 99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request or owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.  For digested lists, there is some digestification software around. Hopefully I'll be able to provide more information in a future version of this posting.  richard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com)\",\" Any suggestions as to what a better solution might be?

A better one might be the July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our major English newsmagazine) by Decima Research ...

I haven't had a chance to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private system had support within statistical noise.  The Decima polls are considered definitive.

Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.

A columnist for the St.  Paul \\\"Pioneer Press\\\" wrote an article giving the \\\"inside scoop\\\" on the  issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible  candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic  Center (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty  confident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will  ultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other  two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the  inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name)  believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also,  because of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed  until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.   However, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed,  because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for  conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to  this mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future  viability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even  further.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of  knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging  Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met,  which may happen.  Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are  Hartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \\\" Ice Demons?\\\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't  been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the  Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in  as many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see  Hartford and Tampa show up there either. So, Minnesota may end up  getting another team, but it may take a few years.     Go Sabres!\",\"This is to let you know that the fourth issue of the Copt-Net Newsletter  has been issued.

The primary U.S. objection is ``Iran's international behaviour'' which includes ``extending support of violence'' to disrupt the Arab Israeli peace process and its rapid build-up of dangerous weapons.  Mack said ``Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace but first it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area.''  Mack spoke at the U.S.-GCC business conference aimed at promoting Gulf-American trade. He said the ``Middle East will be an item very high on the agenda of the U.S. administration.''  The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State Warren Christoper's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhere else in the world, Mack said. He added that the U.S. has no long-term plan to station troops in the Gulf.  Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue to pressure Iraq to ``comply with all the U.N. Security resolutions.''  ``As long as Iraq is ruled by Saddam Hussein we do not expect compliance,'' Mack told delegates. \",\" No, they fold on the dotted line.

For instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain blanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actually performed the action isn't the murderer (but I guess this is actually made clear in the below definition).   What do you mean by \\\"reasonable?\\\"  [...]  Yes, it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition.  But, even though the series is recursively infinite, I think the meaning can still be deduced.   [math lesson deleted]  Okay, let's look at this situation:  suppose there is a longstanding feud between two families which claim that the other committed some travesty in the distant past.  Each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family.  Now, let's suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you don't like dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, there is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty. How do you resolve this?  Well, they are all murders.  Now, I suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your \\\"problem,\\\" but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.  And, in any case, the nested \\\"murderer\\\" in the definition of murder cannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity. And, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition?  See, in a totally objective system where all the information is available, such a nested definition isn't really a problem.\",\"Does anyone work with the A/ROSE card?

Before every instruction some specified registers are masked, eg. to simulate a stuck-at-1-error in certain bits.  Normally, the \\\"crash instance\\\" of A/ROSE notices a crash, sets a flag and stops working. By reading the mentioned flag the Mac can notice a card crash. That works fine for almost all crashes, but as said, sometimes the card doesn't set the flag and disappears from the system.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port         2. X terminals         3. NeXT         4. Silicon Graphics         5. IBM RS/6000  6. Other stuff      1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port   If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard  (Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding  a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation  runs the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used  PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable  to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read  the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.   The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.   a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and  even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server  extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your  server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings  appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,  you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,  or bugging your vendor.   kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.  Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.   Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.      2. X terminals   Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use  PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all  set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the  trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add  extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around  for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.      3. NeXT   NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop  Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they  were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of  upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!      4. Silicon Graphics   Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and  beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't  believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not  possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by  upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more  details.      5. IBM RS/6000   IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||  Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||  cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||  smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||  it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||  works.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||  told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||  anything new, please send me e-mail.        ||          6. Other stuff   Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)  support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your  queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can  get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either  from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in  luck.  Contact the companies for more details.   Apple Adjustable Keyboard     Apple Computer, Inc.     Sales offices all over the place.      Availability: February, 1993     Price: $219     Supports: Mac only      Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The     keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate     backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are     arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.      The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.     A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.      The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not     directly attachable to the keyboard.      As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from     TidBITS available there.   FlexPro Keyboard     Key Tronic     Phone: 800-262-6006     Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299     Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops      Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)     Price: $489 (?)     Supports: PC only (highly likely)      Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's     another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both     the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.     The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.      Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will     probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.   DragonDictate-30K (and numerous other Dragon products)     Dragon Systems, Inc.     320 Nevada Street     Newton, MA  02160      Phone: 800-TALK-TYP or 617-965-5200     Fax: 617-527-0372      Shipping: Now.

The program is called a2x, and is  available via anonymous ftp:   soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/a2x.tar.Z  export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/a2x.tar.Z (most current)   If you want to use your Dragon product with X windows, you may want  to ask for Peter Cohen, an salesman at Dragon who knows more about  this sort of thing.      Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products.     Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles     (including PS/2's and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you     a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number     of popular word processors and spreadsheets.      Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions     to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple     people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file     for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.     On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between     words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.     I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000.      The DragonDictate-30K can recognize 30,000 words at a time.     The DragonWriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time.      Dragon's technology is also part of the following products     (about which I have no other info):   Microsoft Windows Sound System (Voice Pilot)  IBM VoiceType  Voice Navigator II (by Articulate Systems -- for Macintosh)  EMStation (by Lanier Voice Products -- \\\"emergency medical workstation\\\")   The Bat     old phone number: 504-336-0033     current phone number: 504-766-8082      Infogrip, Inc.     812 North Blvd.     Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70802, U.S.A.

(new price!)       ||      Each hand has its own \\\"pod\\\".  Each of the four main fingers has five     switches each: forward, back, left, right, and down.  The thumbs have     a number of switches.  Despite appearances, the key layout resembles     QWERTY, and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to.  The idea is     that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.  The whole pod     tilts in its base, to act as a mouse.

The hardware design is relatively  easy for the company to re-configure.      Price: $690, including one system \\\"personality module\\\".      ||      The idea is that one keyboard works with everything.  You purchase     \\\"compatibility modules\\\", a new cord, and possibly new keycaps, and     then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines.      It's a three-piece folding keyboard.  The layout resembles the     standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections.  Each     section is on a \\\"custom telescoping universal mount.\\\"  Each section     independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each     individual to type in a natural posture.  You can rearrange the three     sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).  Each     section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections     flat, and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard).

The $690 includes one foot  pedal, one set of adhesive wrist pads, and a TypingTutor program.  An additional foot pedal and other accessories are extra.      The layout has a large blank space in the middle, even though the     keyboard is about the size of a normal PC keyboard -- slightly     smaller.  Each hand has its own set of keys, laid out to minimize     finger travel.  Thumb buttons handle many major functions (enter,     backspace, etc.).      You can remap the keyboard in firmware (very nice when software won't     allow the reconfig).      Foot pedals are also available, and can be mapped to any key on the     keyboard (shift, control, whatever).   Maltron  (+44) 081 398 3265 (United Kingdom)     P.C.D.

Soft rubber keys, which rock     forward and backward (each key has three states), make chords for     typing keys.  Learning time is estimated to be 2-3 hours, for getting     started, and maybe two weeks to get used to it.      Currently, the thumbs don't do anything, although a thumb-trackball     is in the works.       The company claims it takes about a week of work to support a     new computer.

If we can get people in the (arena) door by being uncomplicated, then let's do so.  Once we have them, they will realize what a great game hockey is, and we can then teach them something abotu the history of the game.       No, I would not want to see a Ballard division.  But to say that these owners are assholes, hence all NHL management people are assholes would be fallacious.  Conn Smythe, for example, was a classy individual (from what I have heard).    Also, isn't the point of \\\"professional\\\" hockey to make money for all those involved, which would include the players.  What I think you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as should have been their due, and it is the players that are what make the game great not the people who put them on the ice, so naming division after management people rather than players is adding insult (in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was deserved).   \",\"    \",\"Is posible to make copies of these photographs (or any other aerospace photographs at NASM) if you pay a copyright fee?\",\"Does anyone know any good decipleship trainning program during min August  to end of Sept.

The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and clothing for weapons or services.

In fact, \\\"hi'ipoi\\\", the Hawaiian word for \\\"cherish\\\" means \\\"sharing food\\\".  The Great Mahele, in which the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and the poor, was a white man's idea.

No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.  I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.

No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC.

On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:  A (partial?) list:  1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them   concurrently.  2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac  and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice  with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)  3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For  instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor  212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will  work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the  termination, plug it in, and away it goes.  4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that  the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is  quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:  to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very  noticable, as many things can be going on at once.  One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card.    Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits  for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.   The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed  unsafe under federal air quality laws.        \\\"People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to  exacerbate that inflammation,\\\" said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental  Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  \\\"When people are on  the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over  the edge.\\\"       The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits  with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter  of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because  they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of  compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10  exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.        In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at  levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30  microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with  asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.        The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory  Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung  Association's medical section.        The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that  particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study  by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles  may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.   Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms  and bronchitis in children.        \\\"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\\\"  says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"But more and more research is showing that particles are  bad actors as well.\\\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate  air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated  pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex  and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  acid aerosols.        \\\"Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects  of particulate air pollution,\\\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"We have no way of  duplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \\\" Consequently, most of what  is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research  like the Seattle study.        Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur  dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any  time soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with  asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.      \\\"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only  cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's  rarely particulate matter,\\\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \\\"However, PM10 doesn't have  to be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\\\"                                HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993                 NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma  The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on  Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in  dermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance  techniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care  professionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological  characteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management,  and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi  and their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in  preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days of  presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel  weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement.    Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a  distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins;  (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential  for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical  excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and  extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4)  patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high  risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely;  (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for  melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education  and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality  from melanoma.

Within the program, there are four types  of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily  in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on  clinical research; \\\"comprehensive\\\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a  multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community  outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer  prevention and control research.    Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was  the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new  cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage  of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened  the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and  cancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew  progressively.    In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today,  there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria  for comprehensive status.    To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an  institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly  established in 1990, the eight criteria for \\\"comprehensiveness\\\" include the  requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in  several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong  program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings  into clinical practice.    Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly  beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also  referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting  the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass  strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials,  significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important  outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of  sources.    The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and  capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit  important new findings or address timely research questions.

These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers  engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators  and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications  from new discoveries in the laboratory.    Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and  clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently  incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their  overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today.    Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely  structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and  control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health  departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention  and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions  responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.   Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with  institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community  hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.    Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward  creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through  interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the  laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

The  decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to  test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of  Health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and   Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the  therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies  including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH  that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is  intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the   replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's  reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the  MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.   \\\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the  next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\\\" said Shalala.    Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine  Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had  convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested  simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of  multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two  years.  ==================================================================       HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  \\\"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV\\\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol.  114, No. 14, P. 18        AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was  approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome,  the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the  drug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that  although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk  of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit   disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of  the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the  drug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S.  researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials,  many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients  experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of   AIDS symptoms.

The atrocities committed by the Armenian   volunteer forces accompanying the Russian army were so severe that the   Russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the   fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties. The memoirs of many  Russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with   accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these Armenian   guerrillas, which were savage even by relatively primitive standards of  war then observed in such areas.[1]\\\"  [1] \\\"Journal de Guerre du Deuxieme d'Artillerie de Forteresse Russe       d'Erzeroum,\\\" 1919, p. 28.  : >honored me by reproducing my text.

For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people lived  on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet  and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The  Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its  Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the  remainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years,  Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds.   The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.

Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its  predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against  humanity.  x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims  by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.

To one brought up, as most Americans have   been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of   the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious  differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they  were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every   nation in the world would have treated as treasonable.

I'am arguing about  : the Armenian-Nazi colaboration during World War II. Any comment?   It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941,  while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration  camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian  battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had  grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the  cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party  leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by  this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed  and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the  members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of  extermination of the Jews.  This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \\\"encore\\\" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.  Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia (around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who could be expected to oppose their plans.   On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even  though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over 60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the  British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left  the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few  Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring.   Rawlinson wired to his superiors,   \\\"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in  independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops   being without discipline and not being under effective control,  atrocities were constantly being committed.\\\"    Come again?  : \\\"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...

British promised to Venizelos (greek PM) that mainly greek populated areas of the Ottomans will be given to Greece, _if_ he will agree to drag Greece in the side of the British during the WWI (because the greek King was proGerman). The British succeeded by bombarding Athens (1916), killing quite a few, forcing abdication of the King, division of Greece into two separate states (North-South), and finally laying the ground for the most disasterous division between greeks for our century.(So don't feel bitter that the \\\"Allies\\\" gave any green light because they liked us....)  Anyway, the British succeed to establish Venizelos, war starts at a second front against the Germans in the south while they were fighting the war in the East against the Russians, and finally the WWII came in an end. After that the British (and French) forgot immediately their promises (as usually). Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek cause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usual \\\"reasoning\\\" and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they gradually backup Kemal (who had given now to the British \\\"water and bread\\\" that he will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small ethnic-state). The main drive behind this British switch was the plan to keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansion into warm-water facilities. The \\\"greek empire\\\" being an Orthodox Christian state was too prone to become Russian client.  Out of this intrigue, the current state of affairs was established on our lands. While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true \\\"Giants\\\" by the British, since they worked to realize their goals in the region. Under the same plan, currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of big military funds from the US; both they are functioning as anti-Russian buffers, while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept. because otherwise the use of terror of changing \\\"the balance of power in the Aegean\\\" will be used.

The processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the computer is used in its designed purpose.  Comparing processor speed is pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed to increase speed among other things.   I mean how can you say a 040 is faster than a 486 without  giving is operational conditions?  Can you say the same when  you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions. Knowing that 040 does not have transidental functions building in to  its FPU and 486 does, can you say that 040 is still faster?   Anyway, I hope people do not decided upon wether a computers is good or not solely on its processor.  Or how fast a processor is based on its name, because one can alway do a certain things to a processor to speed it up.

P. A1.  NEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE   * INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage    by a man who infiltrated political groups  By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.  SAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-time art dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In reality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40 years.  His code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office.  For a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White Aryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he obtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people.  And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government to trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills.  These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former Los Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with police and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League.  Officials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improper activity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They have refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz.  Transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents released by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory.  At times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air with laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like \\\"Ironsides\\\" and \\\"Flipper.\\\"  On one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a pro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa, Israel.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties to Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him.  Shortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed him.  The court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIA agent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League.  Gerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its contents included passports, driver's licenses and identification cards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for four American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank birth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies.  Also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a black hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of blindfolded and chained men.  Investigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the ADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one target group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.  Each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant.  The Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil rights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL's fact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists.   However, evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept files on at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the United Farm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center for Investigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, the Asian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP.  The computer files also included information on several members of Congress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey from the Bay Area.  In their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation League has collected information on political activists in the Los Angeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely with three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized in intelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism expert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligence officer.  A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation, and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declined comment.  Bullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as a volunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party.  Bullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by the ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In the mid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the West Coast.  To keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never missed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said.  \\\"I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all anti-democratic movements,\\\" Bullock said.  \\\". . . Officially, I'm only a contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would not be officially connected with me.\\\"  Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists to Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own name but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink.  \\\"I'm one of a kind,\\\" he told police.  In recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly become known, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him.  In the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police.  In part because of this investigation, he became close friends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Francisco police intelligence division.  Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An FBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group:  \\\"Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and would share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to Gerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to Bullock.\\\"  From a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876 individuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose files contained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people.  In 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the South African government.  Bullock tells of meetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100 bills.  Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published by San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African Bishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli -- and submitted it as his own work.  Bullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence.  Bullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African government evenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, \\\"I may be gay but I'm a straight arrow.\\\"  In his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law.  For example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records and criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said Gerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence files on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy.  Bullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation of Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League's San Francisco office.  Bullock seemed proud of his \\\"Operation Eavesdrop,\\\" in which he used a paid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White Aryan Resistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by members of the right-wing group.  \\\"For a short time, it was wonderful,\\\" he told police.  In Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a \\\"fact-finder\\\" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups.  Among other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los Angeles ADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had \\\"anti-Israel leanings\\\" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment.  Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate group.  Gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the probe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation.  Unlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation.  Gurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed by The Times. Bullock's attorney said his client would not comment.\",\"Detroit's going to beat Toronto in 6 or LESS!!!   Granted, Gilmour should get the Hart Trophy, NOT Lemieux...

I don't think that it's because it was the war that hit Israel the hardest.  Also, in 1967 it was Egypt, not Israel who kicked out the UN force.  In 1948 it was the Arabs who refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SET BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  In 1956, Egypt closed off the Red Sea to Israeli shipping, a clear antagonistic act.  And in 1982 the attack was a response to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the Golan Heights.  Children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and Israel finally retaliated.  Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that  the borders could be expanded.

Is anyone out there in Christendom listening? If so, why don't we get some dialog going here?  Here's a topic to get things started. My daughter's Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent something *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a national (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible.   What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war.   Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days. Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it happen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand.

There is no such thing as wrap at this university. I also asked around here. Ther is no wrap at  Marquette, University of Wisconsin Madison, Utah State, Weber State or Embry Riddle U. I am not saying that it doees not happen but in every instance that I have been able to track down it does not. Also the president of our University who was Provost at University of West Virgina said that it did not happen there either and that this figure must be included in the overhead to be a legitimate charge.   I did they never heard of it but suggest that, like our president did, that any percentage number like this is included in the overhead.   No Allen you did not. You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee of the Overhead capital of NASA. Nothing that Reston does could not be dont better or cheaper at the Other NASA centers  where the work is going on. Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is at a place where everything is overhead.   Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally demanded change that caused the problems? Methinks that you are being  selective with the facts again.   If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost of 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year. You stated that your \\\"friend\\\" at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it for a billion a year \\\"if the wrap were gone\\\".

Many of our monitors, as they age, develop shadows on white and bright colors. \",\"  I remember seeing an artical on large-engine oil  requirements, and one of the ways of prolonging the life of the oil was to run through a heated un-presurized chamber to allow water and volitiles to boil off. This made such long-term usage of  oil practical.  Isn't the Discovery channel great!?! \",\" Yes, it's important to realize that all actions have consequences, and that \\\"rules\\\" were made for our own good.  But to suggest that a *disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is  taking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease for lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed blindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare say all of us would be walking into walls.  Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real* careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for  sin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the result of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was blind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any other STD is a *punishment\\\" for sexual sin, what do we do with  diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as debilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a specific behavior or lifestyle?  Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin. The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central message of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins, and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of our sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He has graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or  some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that Jesus made.  In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ, no more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think it's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus healed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS. She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed  relationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be, but God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining weight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes her improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.  Paul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I  think applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I (or something like that).  May we all experience and accept God's grace.   =============================================================================== Paul Conditt  Internet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.edu Applied Research Phone:   (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416/3259   Laboratories  Fedex:   10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423 University of Texas Postal:   P.O.

I'm going on what I have read and heard from friends. Basically the Glock is great but I have heard/read that it is a lot harder to learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has.  I was looking at a Glock .40S&W and the S&W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the safties on the guns were very different.  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot more \\\"safe\\\"  (for lack of a better word) than the one on the Glock.  Of course this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  You would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.  Personally I like the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool (guess that's why they use them in so many movies) but I wouldn't get one as my first semi-auto because of the safety.  I would prefer more training with a \\\"traditional\\\" semi-auto (ala Colt .45) but of course that's just my opinion.\",\"HP 48SX calculator with 128K card.

Anyone who agrees with something  I say can't be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \\\"scientific\\\"  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \\\"If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.\\\"    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \\\"There've got to be controlled studies\\\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying \\\"We don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.\\\"    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  \\\"Why should I prove your  theory?\\\"  and  \\\"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\\\"   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of  books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as I'm capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \\\"doctrinnaire\\\"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\": Frank Crary posted: : : Sure, but the difference in per-capita crime rates predates the : : gun control laws: The homicide rate in England was a tenth that : : of America, back when anyone in England could buy a gun without : : any paperwork at all.  : Steve Manes asks: : > Got a citation for this?  : Colin Greenwood from Scotland Yard did a study that showed that gun : control has had no effect on crime or murder rates in the UK.

I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience can be trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something so materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess anything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were discussing the \\\"mind\\\" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal, as it were; and half spiritual.   ?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the ?possibility of error appears.

To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain.  This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method.   ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?\\\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some ?

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we   agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.   When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could   get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he   started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had   miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed   another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was   their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I   reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be   treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole   deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,   snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by   the turn of events.  Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting   to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and   asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him   that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,   that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs   and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still   pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to   lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told   him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.  A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all   apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus   knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about   it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,   and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....  I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we   decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him   back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the   truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the   incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of   there in my new truck in about 30 mins.  So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not   have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales   person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I   sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their   mistake.  Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred   dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.

As some of you may be aware, I've posted a lot of articles lately on personality typing (of which the MBTI is a test vehicle).  To come up to speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for by personality type summary file.  One observation is that people have significantly different personalities (no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect to church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while other people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more solitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if confronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of people.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.  My impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and create environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted (there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am quite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches to participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very uncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly influenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing. (BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both preferences have their place in the Body).  Maybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words are usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert scale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is excerpted from my summary:  1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:          Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside                           world of people, activities or things.          Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal                           world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.   Hopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can structure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise the Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities to fit them into a particular framework.  I'm sure there are other aspects of how churches have not properly understood personality variances among their members to the detriment of all.

Yes, Cripple *might* be for end-to-end encyption, dropping to clear when the other end doesn't have Cripple.

I guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material.  do you know of a generic (cheaper) substitute?  My headlight is a Halogen 60/55 W bulb.  Is there an easy, brighter replacement bulb available?  Where should I look for one?  As always, I very much appreciate your help.  The weather in Philadelphia has finally turned WARM.  This weekend I saw lotsa bikes, and the riders ALL waved.  A nice change of tone from what Philadelphia can be like. . . .  Chris \",\" Purists often distinguish between \\\"true\\\" clubbing and \\\"pseudo\\\" clubbing, the difference being that with \\\"true\\\" clubbing the angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly negative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip). With \\\"pseudo\\\" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then negative, which is the normal situation. \\\"Real\\\" internists can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple of minutes.  Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only \\\"true\\\" clubbing is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is very reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the  congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization.   The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally.   Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however, the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.\",\"; ;>Most people wave or return my wave when I'm on my Harley. ;>Other Harley riders seldom wave back to me when I'm on my ;>duck. Squids don't wave, or return waves ever, even to each ;>other, from what I can tell. ; ;  When we take a hand off the bars we fall down!  The problem is that Squids and BadAssBikers can't recognize each other's waves.  When you're riding a cruiser, you \\\"wave\\\" by lifting two or three fingers of the left hand, without first removing that hand from the handlebar.  When you're riding a crotch rocket, you lower the left hand to about ankle level, palm forward, and call that a wave.  Generic bike riders actually seem to raise the hand entirely off the handlebar and wave it around, so it's easy to tell when they're waving. \",\" Dr. cheghadr bA namakand!

But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.  1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)  2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere.  3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.  4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to any of the original points.  I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)   An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting at a point. This might be easier to implement.\",\" [FAQ and Darius' response deleted]    I am myself an SDA and I am in total agreement with what Darius has to say.   I also worship on Saturday to honor the Lord.  Your mention of \\\"[esteeming]  all days alike\\\" IMO has to do with the fast days observed by the Jews.  But  no matter how you interpret that passage, I do accept your worship on Sunday  as being done in honor of the Lord, in contrast with what many of my fellow  SDA believers may believe.  To me, though, the bible overwhelmingly points  to Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of God's  deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.  To those who would  attempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic,  this is simply not the case.  Rather, keeping Saturday allows me a full day  to rest and contemplate God's goodness and grace.    The idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted the  Corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the first day of the  week was because that was when they received their weekly wages.  Paul  wanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority, before  spending their money on other things.  I do not have any proof in front of  me for this though, although it would explain why they would lay aside money  in their homes instead of a meeting.     It would seem to me that you assume that the christians in the NT regularly  worshipped on the first day.  I assume that the christians in the NT  regularly worshipped on the seventh day.  But I agree with you that we only  have implications because the authors did assume the reader knew when worhip  was.\",\" There is an excellent software program called Astro.calc that does that and much more.

She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she  believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.   (Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the  food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit forming) ?  This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are: Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in  pet food?  ----------------------------------- I speak for myself and not Motorola -----------------------------------  \",\"  So how much would it cost as a private venture, assuming you could talk the U.S. government into leasing you a couple of pads in Florida?   \",\"  maybe the missile didn't hit directly such that his body gets \\\"desintegrated.\\\"  of course, destroying 10 houses to kill someone is not a surgical operation, or is it?      \",\"           Yep...

Move to Canada.  Yesterday I was able to watch FOUR games...the NJ-PITT at 1:00 on ABC, LA-CAL at 3:00 (CBC),  BUFF-BOS at 7:00 (TSN and FOX), and MON-QUE at 7:30 (CBC).  I think that if each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd consecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess).  I have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE and keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two afternoon games.  Btw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemed to know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore and they did an excellent job.  They were quite impartial also, IMO.  \",\" Gulp.

Your fascist government got away with  the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying  the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away  with the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in  Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem  districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed and hundreds of civilians also perished.     Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included     the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,    Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives,     children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians     joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan     districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of    3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished    to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to    the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and    seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell    into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims    themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels    also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the    large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from    occupying the city.     The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out    the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the    neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They    raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours'    distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.     At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,    Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible    atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in    the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the    neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.     Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the    Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four    villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,    they continued to spread death and destruction among the    Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down    their arms.

Again, just an offshoot of believe-it-and-it-becomes-true- don't-believe-it-and-it-doesn't.    Like other religions I'm aquainted with, Islam teaches exclusion and caste, and suggests harsh penalties for _behaviors_ that have no logical call for punishment (certain limits on speech and sex, for example).  To me this is not good.  I see much pain and suffering without any justification, except for the _waving of the hand_ of some inaccessible god.  By the by, you toss around the word knowledgable a bit carelessly. For what is a _knowledgeable believer_ except a contradiction of terms.  I infer that you mean believer in terms of having faith. And If you need knowledge to believe then faith has nothing to do with it, does it?\",\"wlsmith@valve.heart.rri.uwo.ca (Wayne Smith) write:  Nice of you to DELETE BOTH YOUR responce and the item that prompted it. to whit:                                       ^^^ To which YOU responded: To which I correctly pointed out the following:                          As I said this is sloppy and DUMB {YOU should resounded by DISCOUNTING the Mac NOT giving \\\"Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320\\\" example.

I was referring to the fact that far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For much of the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point where long-distance flights became practical.

However, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the Navigator's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and merchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be shared.     The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations can even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft), Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in 1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only a gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.   Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions asked. \",\"  On the one hand there are advantages to having the liturgy stay the  same.  John has described some of these.  On the other hand, some people  seem to start tuning out `the same old words' and pay attention better  when things get changed around.  I think innovative priests and liturgy  committees are trying to get our attention and make things more  meaningful for us.  It drives me crazy too.   Different people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy.  My  local parish is innovative.  I prefer to go to Mass at the next parish  over.  Sometimes we don't have the option of attending a Mass in the  style which best suits us.  John put a smiley on it but to \\\"just offer  it up\\\" probably is the solution.  A related issue, that it sounds like John does not have to deal with, is  that spouses may have different liturgical tastes.  My husband does like  innovative litury.  It is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual  needs without just going our separate ways.  When you include the factor  of also trying to satisfy our children's needs, things get pretty  complicated.

Note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application.  For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.

Here are some observations gained from painful experience:    1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.      Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more      sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.    2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear      that these things will itch for months.    3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of      it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,      since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could      find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special      collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is      required to get it.    4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old      folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall      reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers      burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I      think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some      sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.    5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.      A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally      applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is      another preparation called \\\"Chig Away\\\" that is a combination of      sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was      prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In      the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get      up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we      live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They      apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur      as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)    6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget      the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment      that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone      creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine      (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.      Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this      counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think      it gains nothing).    7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved      by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery      as well.  Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money.\",\"I have a 86 chevy sprint with a/c and 4doors. It's odometer turned 90k and the sensor light started blinking. I went to the dealer and he said it was a maintenance light saying I need to change the Oxygen sensor. He said, It is to be changed every 30k, but since I bought the car when it had 77k, I don't know if the same thing happened at 30k and 60k.  He quoted $198 for the part and $50 to install it. The part cost $30 outside, but the mechanic I went to could not fix it saying the sensor is placed too deep in the engine parts. He suggested I wait till it malfunctions before I do anything.

I've never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists that he has, so I'd love to have a cite.   Wrong.  There's one gun design where that can happen, and it is supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber. (Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under the hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe manner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their trigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.   The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the described circumstance) is near zero.

I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver with other similarly configured computers.  I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen.  The problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors start changing themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you open a full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't have any problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initially return to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly.  Also, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, the design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc.  The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the screen gets refreshed again.  If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell network, everything is fine.  I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to this machine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machine and the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I tried reloading Windows to no avail.  Any thoughts on things to check out?  I am totally baffled!  Thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction!\",\" While I agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding, I disagree strongly with your original point. The point of formal training  must be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion to know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike  in a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular. Countersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among  new bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the  motorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the direction opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous. I have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she is to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the  motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right  handle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road.  A worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn the rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.  The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency  situations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) of countersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.\",\" Still searching for an irrelevant issue in which to mire a pro-lifer, I see.

Where do they come  #from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from #whatever is societally mandated.  It's only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what is necessary to keep that society going  - and often it's a little over-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different thing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble), but is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating meat may be perfectly legal.  # #>#Merely a question for the basis of morality #># #>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_. #># #>#1)Who is society # #>Depends on the society. # #Doesn't help.  Is the point irrelevant?  No.  Often the answer is \\\"we are\\\".  But if society is those who make the rules, that's a different question.  If society is who should make the rules, that's yet another.  I don't claim to have the answers, either, but I don't think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things about the US system, at least in principle.  # #>#2)How do \\\"they\\\" define what is acceptable? # #>Depends. #On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).

The hard trick is to recognise when it is, and equally importantly, when it isn't.  # and only interfering when it's truly #>necessary. # #Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?  IMO, it isn't often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various kinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive  the right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort of liar's paradox: \\\"force is necessary for freedom\\\".   One possible justification is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if we don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom. # #  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem #>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem #>to agree that some level of interference is necessary. # #They see the need for a \\\"justice\\\" system.

What I see as arrogance and the problem I have  with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just  Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.    Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal  sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these  matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them  but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus  anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that leads to arrogance.

The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.

Should morals be based on social rules? On ancient religious doctrines? It seems there will *NEVER* be a common and single denominator for defining morals, and as such defining absolute and objective morals is doomed to fail as long as humans have  this incredible talent of creative thinking.  Cheers, Kent\",\"  Science does not progress via experimentation but by philosophising.  One aim of experiments is to investigate the validity of the hyptheses resulting from the models produced by this thinking process.   Science has one advantage of all other approaches to explaining the world. It is objective.   Anything which affects the physical world can be studied.  For example, since we are part of the physical world, anything (including spirits) which affects our behaviour can be observed.  Science does not make any claims about the existence or non-existence of objects which do not affect the physical world.   The purpose of science is to produce a model of the *physical* world.  The model must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome of future observations.  One of the aims of experiments is to carry out well defined observations which are objective.  Ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world, and the model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions.  At the moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some *spiritual* world existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a *spiritual* world.  As the non-spiritual models has fewer assumptions it should be the currently accepted models.  The scientific process never assumes that its present models are the correct ones, whereas many religions claim to represent the truth.  The arrogance of many theists is that they claim to represent the truth, this cannot be said of scientists.\",\" Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode (probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar not spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft.  In order to turn the spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be available, or you need to retrain a new team.  Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed. Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA  series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set. Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a \\\"standby\\\" mode for use in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is still required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is relatively cheap.  Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance to stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin- stabilized control mode because it would require little power or  maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time to time.  In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money), but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.\",\"I have an old tandon type modem (that's all the info I have apart from  the fact that it is black!).

The picture will show energy patterns or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary.

Some other owners on the ford-probe@world.std.com mailing list have commented  about this problem, but I haven't seen it happen on my 3 month old  '93 Probe GT.  I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since  the initial batch of cars.  Also, someone said that Ford has issued a  service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you  may be able to get your dealer to fix it.   Haven't seen any of these problems, nor have I seen these mentioned on the mailing list, so these might just be having bad luck with these.   Definitely!   No problems like these either.  I haven't been able to find any obvious  places where they screwed up.   Hmmm!  I got two keys with my car.  Something tells me you got stiffed by your dealer on this.  (Actually, if you count the \\\"credit card\\\" key that  came in the owner's binder, I got 3 keys, but since the credit card key doesn't have any teeth cut in it yet, I guess I won't count it. :-))   The latter is probably because of the air bag.  It's pretty much takes up all the space where you'd expect to find the horn.  Speaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind. The previous Probes had Japanese horns.   Yeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.   I agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.  The interior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically sound.  ...  Yes, this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone.  I personally like it, but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, I'd strongly suggest looking into the MX-6.   The problem with the back seat is that there's no leg room.  Plenty of  head room, though.  Shorter people fit back there without any complaints, so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to  give them a place to put their feet.   The power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car. :-) I really enjoy the moonroof, by the way, but then I've always been a sucker for open air driving.  No leakage problems or anything like that...yet!   I haven't heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes ('89 and maybe '90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which Ford will replace at no charge), but I haven't heard about anything like this concerning the '93 Probes.  I haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot that was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my car.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering that I was expecting the worst from them!  From what I've heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with  the Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but  I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.  That's almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this, though.

First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami, it had a summer atmosphere in early spring for baseball.

The way they were cheering, I thought it was the AFC playoffs.

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier.

I've been working reduced hours the past couple of weeks because I had a son born (the day after Umar's article was posted, btw).  I did respond within a couple of days, but it turns out that a a coincidental news software rearrangement caused postings from this site to silently disappear rather than going out into the world.  This is a revision of that original response.   [this was in response to the claim that \\\"Rushdie made false statements about the life of Mohammed\\\", with the disclaimer \\\"(fiction, I know, but where is the line between fact and fiction?) - I stand by this distinction between fiction and \\\"false statements\\\"]   I had not seen that claim, or I might have been less sweeping.  You have made what I consider factual misstatements about events in the book, which I have raised in the past, in the \\\"ISLAM: a clearer view\\\" thread as well as the root of the \\\"Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW]\\\" thread.  My statement was not that you had not read the book, but that you had not convinced me that you [inter alia] had.  As I said before, if you want to defend your position, then produce evidence, and respond to the evidence I have posted; so far you have not.  Of course, my statement was not directly aimed at you, but broadly at a number of Muslim posters who have repeated propaganda about the book, indicating that they haven't read it, and narrowly at Gregg Jaeger, who subsequently admitted that he hadn't in fact read the book, vindicating my skepticism in at least that one case.  So far, the only things I have to go on regarding your own case are a) the statements you made concerning the book in the \\\"a clearer view\\\" posting, which I have challenged (not interpretation, but statements of fact, for instance \\\"Rushdie depicts the women of the most respected family in all of Islam as whores\\\"), and b) your claim (which I had not seen before this) that you have indeed read it cover to cover.  I am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on critical interpretation, but you'll have to support your end, by responding to my criticism.  I have no doubt as to the ability of a particular Muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding passages to take personal offense at, but you have upheld the view that \\\"TSV *is* intended as an attack on Islam and upon Muslims\\\".  This view must be defended by more than mere assertion, if you want anyone to take it seriously.   And I appreciate it, but welcome to the club.  I am defending my honest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated (or otherwise) insulting attack on Islam, and the parallel opinion that most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baseless propaganda.  I have supported my statements and critical interpretationa with in-context quotes from the book and Rushdie's essays, which is more than my correspondents have done.

As many knowledgeable people have pointed out, msg is a naturally  occurring substance in a lot, if not most, foods.  When food  manufacturers add it to a preparation, they do so because it's a  known flavor enhancer.   Your wife's theory, that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite,  may well be true.  But I don't believe it's ALWAYS the reason it's  added.  People are (largely, for the most part) in charge of their  own appetites.   You don't know much about cats, do you?

Oversampling takes two discrete data points, and interpolates n-1 points between them for n times oversampling.  When I asked, people said that the interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more complicated.  Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the \\\"effective\\\" sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling lets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher oversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of all other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias filtering.\",\" No answer.

I've seen Gravis joysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my hand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than a year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability to adjust the tension of the stick.  I recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick.  I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works quite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so leaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear and feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or down in features.  For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here compared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra $10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.  Just another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something that needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up, down, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into a Gravis gamepad.

Regards, Vesselin\",\"I have come across what I consider to be an excellent tract. It is a bit lengthy for a posting, but I thought I'd share it with all of you anyway. Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says. May God richly bless those who read it.   =======================================================================                      D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?     Q. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs,    tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, \\\"God Loves You.\\\"  Isn't    that true?   A. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read    in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:         For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten       Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but       have everlasting life.                               John 3:16           The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he       loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9         For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of       the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6     Q. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good    I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How    can these verses apply to me?   A. By  God's  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is    looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The    Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.    On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before    God.         As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There       is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after       God.                                            Romans 3:10-11         The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately       wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9     Q. If I am such a wicked person in God's sight, what will God do to me?   A. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will    come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.         For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the       lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,       and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap       mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They       shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,       and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of       beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.                                                 Deuteronomy 32:22-24     Q. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not    that bad.   A. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-    ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible    makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal    and consists of perpetual suffering.         And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was       cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15         So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come       forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall       cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and       gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50         ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with       his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them       that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord       Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting       destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory       of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9     Q. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?   A. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be    accountable to God for his actions.  God's perfect  justice  demands    payment for sin.         For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23         For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;       that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,       according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:10         But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,       they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.                                                        Matthew 12:36     Q. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought    to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?   A. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our    substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our    sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus    Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.         All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one       to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of       us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6         But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for       our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;       and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5         For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also       received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the       scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the       third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4         For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that       we might be made the righteousness of God in him.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:21     Q. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was    already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about    Hell anymore?   A. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it    is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.    Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.         He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he       that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath       of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36     Q. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that    the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to    Hell?   A. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our    minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole    lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to    the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins    and serve Christ as our Lord.         No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,       and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and       despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.                                                         Matthew 6:24         Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be       blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the       presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19     Q. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except    through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their    followers also go to Hell?   A. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-    able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other    religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their    followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and    save us.         Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none       other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be       saved.                                               Acts 4:12           I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the       Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6         If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us       our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.                                                           1 John 1:9     Q. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?   A. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You    must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see    your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.         And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much       as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,       God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13         ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe       on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...                                                        Acts 16:30-31     Q. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?   A. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He    also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that    He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.         For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of       yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8      God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,    if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you    should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is    the only Word of God.    In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented    paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.         So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of       God.                                              Romans 10:17     Q. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?   A. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging    our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.         The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a       contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17      Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin    to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we    sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins    as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to    Hell.         Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him       to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his       iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26     Q. Doesn't  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be    baptized?  Will these save me?   A. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.    No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God's    sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-    ure.  Salvation is         Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9     Q. What else will happen at the end of the world?   A. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed    into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-    more.         For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,       with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:       and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are       alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the       clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be       with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17     Q. What will happen to the earth at that time?   A. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens    and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-    more.         But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in       the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and       the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and       the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...       Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new       heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.                                                      2 Peter 3:10,13     Q. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will    come?   A. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to    save.         And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the       world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end       come.                                            Matthew 24:14     Q. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?   A. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing    of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the    Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not    come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the    Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be    very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.         For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden       destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with       child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3         Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his       secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7     Q. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.   A. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to    destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.         And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he       cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be       overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4     Q. What did the people of Nineveh do?   A. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented    of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.         But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry       mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil       way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can       tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his       fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9     Q. Did God hear their prayers?   A. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.     Q. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-    ment?   A. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has    become very short.         How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which       at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed       unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3         In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,       and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye       people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for       us.                                               Psalm 62:7-8                     A R E  Y O U  R E A D Y  T O  M E E T  G O D ?       A  book  entitled  1994?,  written by Harold Camping, presents Biblical information that we may be very near the end of time.

A  number  of  minor changes  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing and  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph which  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the text.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they appear here as indented paragraphs.     I have read Mr. Camping's book, compared it with what the Bible actual- ly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that there  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed one  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these matters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return, it  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with respect  to life expectancy no longer applies.

To paraphrase Acts 20:27,  it  does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of God.  I am  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible with anyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of any real  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so little time  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.

Yes, shotguns had been used in WWI, the Spanish-American War, and the US Civil War. That was not in question. The possession of a sawed-off shotgun was, i.e., a weapon altered to improve concealibility.   You are free to produce evidence that I'm not willing to abide with all the implications of this.

Perhaps it is a quirk of the new machines?\",\"     Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.    Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be, and isn't.     I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement.   First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ  could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the  male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.   Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.   Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option.   I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\",\"  It may have been passed to Toronto, but I've even seen an octopus at the Aud -- last year's Bruins-Sabres game.  I knew all about the Detroit version, but seeing at the Aud was a bit puzzling.  :-) \",\" John 12:24-26: \\\"Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls onto the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain.   \\\"He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.   \\\"If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also.  If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.\\\"  Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?  If we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us?  Why would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I will die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have before that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be content to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too are dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.  In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically mean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and fend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no matter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.  If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be it.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants my respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it does, then they will be very strong and true.   Jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was Osiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or Norse legend, if memory serves.  But still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?   If your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do -- provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any religion.   That's precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin. Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?   You've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he just rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.  But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the verses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view, which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only he or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with that: substitute \\\"Moslem\\\" or \\\"Buddhist\\\" or \\\"Satanist\\\" instead of \\\"Christian\\\", and it means the same thing.  Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD, you've got some convincing to do.   And in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities where there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life.  As long as you keep your beliefs to yourself, I'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start waving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.\",\"Here is the price list for the

According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies,   we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10   times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of   1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as   dramatically.      When standards of living, population densities, and industrial   structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy   efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group   of Seven nations.      Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil   price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the   cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,   even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the   overall U.S. economy.      Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per   $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.      Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side   management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource   inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not   reduce demand.      Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes   unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that   subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,   gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood   of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state   at the expense of the individual.      \\\"Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion\\\" is no.   189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an   independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.    Available from:   Cato Institute   224 Second Street SE   Washington, DC  20003    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                             The Cato Institute      Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research   foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate   to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the   traditional American principles of limited government, individual   liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve   greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in    questions of policy and the proper role of government.     The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets   that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th   century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation   of the American Revolution.     Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually   no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive   intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary   intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for   civil liberties.     To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive   publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy   issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned   to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military   spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy   conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are   published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.

Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the henrik]  KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan.   BM] Gimme a break.  CAPITAL letters, or NOT, the above is pure nonsense.  It BM] seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      Again, Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves. What do      want them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.  BM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment, BM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it BM] is a part of it.    Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged  training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.   henrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000  henrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the  henrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending  henrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION.   BM]  Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them BM]  within their borders?     Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into          the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.  henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the  henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER  henrik] OCCUR again.  BM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?     It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped    into Armenia if SHE could.   BM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header BM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?     Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many         cases, HISTORY repeats itself.   BM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes  BM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring BM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians  BM] are attacking Azeri towns.   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey         wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!   I will believe it when I see it.   Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing         to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean  BURNING people ALIVE !  BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  BM] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.     Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are          NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN.   BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent  BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe  BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better  BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the  conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in  KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.  BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes BM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of  BM] their blood and future.    Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension         to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH         are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.  BM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  BM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians BM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  BM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in BM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for BM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading BM] inflammatory half-truths.\",\"HI,   I am looking for an X app that will display dxf files.

As for 'war' I am not sure how I would define it. If you just look at attacks on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. Would you count the riots in the 20's and 30's? Violence but not war. I personally think that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requires organisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces. Perhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it was so. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone organisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a cause for criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the 'Zionist' camp.   Now you are being silly aren't you? In any case the war did NOT start with the invasion of the Arab Armies. You see we both agree on something. And the previous posters were wrong, no?   Again I am not sure, I doubt you want my opinion anyway, but I think war requires organisation as I said before. It needs a group to command and plan. If Fatah lauches rockets from Southern Lebanon (and are you sure you have the right group - not the Moslems again?) then that sounds like war to me. Stone throwing does not.

like those who use their backs instead of their minds to make }>their living who are usually ignorant and intolerant of anything outside }>of their group or level of understanding.  There seems to be some confusion between rednecks and white trash. The confusion is understandable, as there is substantial overlap between the two sets. Let me see if I can clarify:  Rednecks: Primarily use their backs instead of their minds to make a  living. Usually somewhat ignorant (by somebody's standards,  anyway) because they have never held education above basic  reading/writing/math skills to be that important to their  eventual vocation. Note I did not say stupid, just ignorant.  (They might be stupid, but then so are some high percentage  of any group).  White trash: \\\"White trash fit the stereotype referred to by the  word 'nigger' better than any black person I ever met, only  with the added 'bonus' that white trash are mean as hell.\\\"  -- my father. Genuinely lazy (not just out of work or under-  qualified), good-for-nothing, dishonest, white people who are  mean as snakes. The \\\"squeal like a pig\\\" boys in _Deliverance_  may or may not have been rednecks, but they were sure as hell  white trash.  White trash are assuredly intolerant of anything outside of their group or level of understanding. Rednecks may or may not be.\",\"    I'm sorry, I thought we were discussing heresy.  I assumed that heresy meant a departure from orthodoxy, in which case generally accepted belief is indeed an important issue.  In this case, the definition of the word \\\"create\\\" is of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed.     I should have said \\\"given the Mormon belief.\\\"  If you disagree with the Mormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally existent substance than one of ex nihilo creation, then that is the important point.     Correction: you interpret the Bible to mean something very specific by such terms.     It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they believe.  Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and Lucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or organized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being \\\"offspring\\\" of God has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually \\\"born again\\\" of Him.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.  This is how language works, Robert, and it's why making someone an offender for a word is dangerous.   <...>     On the contrary, Robert, it is not a red herring at all to show that those who rely wholly on the Bible cannot seem to agree on what it says.  You say that one must simply \\\"look at the Bible\\\" to see what it teaches, but centuries of people doing just that have sho0wn that no one is really sure what it says. Are we to believe that you are the only one who really understands the scriptures?     Let me clarify this one more time.  You did not refer to the Mormon belief that Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie's belief in same.  We keep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of Mormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it. (see below)     On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie's words as Mormon canon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great* importance.  The fact is that they are not.  Whether or not they indicate general Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large number of Mormons.\",\"[MODERATOR:  Nice summary, Keith, thanks.]  I talked to the federal Dept. of Justice (DOJ, Ottawa) to try and clarify a bunch of things regarding changes to Canadian gun laws. I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email, followup to t.p.g.  1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get    a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I    was told by a police officer. 2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to    protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns    must be stored locked up and unloaded, however. 3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will    be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.    The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form    authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.      Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these    'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will    be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess    them, but will not be allowed to stock them. 4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will    not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations    specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some     manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.    (God knows how much they'll charge for these)  This covers most of what we discussed.  I have typed this from memory, do not take it as gospel.  I am not a lawyer and I refuse to play one on TV.   --  -------------------------------------------------------------------\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis   Dear Josh  I appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions.  Having said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.  1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards identify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S. citizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are just trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or religious identity to any public official who so requests ?  2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all kinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy. You did not respond to my question.  3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is interesting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear weapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?  4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a Ma'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases like Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and imprisoned.  5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status of the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for the occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law). The law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so, why doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?  6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return conflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands of non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under Israel control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from returning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also left, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to return. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ? Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in his homeland ?  7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that information, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all inhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other atrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by Israeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University Press. Is this book available in your library ?  8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in Israeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very little evidence available about that. As much as I know, many Arabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are not accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want Arabs ?  9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was whether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to discourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but evaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants to keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious communities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests to officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a secular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.   I would be glad to have some more input from you after these comments.\",\"I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old (1 year?) Asante EN/SC adapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the newest drivers from Asante's ftp server.  The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain - specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac tests memory, etc. Just before the \\\"happy Mac face\\\" normally shows up, the power light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the Asante box pretty much unusable.  It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed during the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has *never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had it for over a year).  Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk -- several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator (both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal resistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another identical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.  Has anybody seen this? More importantly, does anyone have a solution? Thanks a lot.    E. \",\"Quoting Jeffrey J.

You can also swap the cruddy cable  shifter for the newer rod shifter, also a change worth making, but that'll  cost you some $$.  My brakes usually do one wibble-wobble on startup, so that is probably  normal.  Didn't know they had a self-test, that's interesting.

I should be possible to write an X server that does this as far as I can tell, but what I'm asking is if there is already one.  --  mike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu \",\"Frank, I tried to mail this but it bounced.  It is fast moving out of t.a scope, but I didn't know if t.a was the only group of the three that you subscribed to. Apologies to regular t.a folks.    You must be using 'values' to mean something different from the way I see it used normally.  And you are certainly using 'Science' like that if you equate it to \\\"the real world\\\".  Science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning those perceptions.  It has nothing to do with values as far as I can see. Values are ... well they are what I value. They are what I would have rather than not have - what I would experience rather than not, and so on.  Objective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are applicable to everyone.   I don't agree. Science is useful insofar as it the predictions mentioned above are accurate.  That is insofar as what I think *will be* the effect on my perceptions of a time lapse (with or without my input to the Universe) versus what my perceptions actually turn out to be.  But values are about whether I like (in the loosest sense of the word) the  perceptions :-)   I don't see why. 'Usefulness' in science is synonomous with 'accuracy' - period. Tarot predictions are not useful because they are not accurate - or can't be shown to be accurate. Science is useful because it is apparently accurate.  Values - objective or otherwise - are beside the point.  No?\",\": Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for : Windows 3.1.

Chris -- \",\" I couldn't have said it better, Mark!\",\"/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / mikey@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Strider) /  8:51 pm  Apr 12, 1993 /   I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even contributed a few comments) but this stuff \\\"I'd rather face a knife than a gun\\\" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the same thing, then I got 'educated.'  People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick (within a minute or so) death.  The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are 'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.  Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as the attacker.  Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their knife attacks in prison.  If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3 seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the pointed end.)  Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth. Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'  This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.  The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk (a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually do this.  Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason 'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive.  I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes.\",\"KM>  Is the 486DX3/99 anything more than a myth?

I am currently working on a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with Phoenix BIOS, using C++, to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU with UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and  Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit, but there seems to be something wrong with the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to access the unit I built using C, because I have a sizable chunk of C code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085.  I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code that I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack of knowledge about RS-232 serial communications, please e-mail me. I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and then to check it against the 0x20 character, if a 0x20 is received,  the LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do nothing, but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses the bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt int86() function in dos.h.  I have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 ) the parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits ) and the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ).  Currently, I am at a loss as to what may be wrong.  Any hardware gurus out there want to comment?

My point is that \\\"if life has meaning or importance then we should try to find that meaning or importance\\\" which is almost a tautology. (I hope I'm not being too patronizing.) One term for that meaning is \\\"Creator\\\", though that is not obvious from my above argument.   (It's more like \\\"I think, therefore I am, therefore God is.\\\")   Unfortunately the term \\\"religious\\\" is ambiguous to me in this context. I could say that searching for meaning in life is by definition being religious. I could say cult followers by definition have given up on  the search.

But you claim these are villages with civilians, and Iraelis claim they are  camps filled with terrorists. You claim that israelis shell the villages with the 'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad,  civilians die, right ? I am not so sure.   As somebody wrote, Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting manner. And he also claimed 'civilians murdered'. Let me ask you, isn't there  at least a slight chance that you (not only, and the question is very general,  no insult) are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in southern Lebanon ?  Now, a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil' kind of Mediteranean sea. How do you define Israeli soil ? From what you say, if you do not clearly  recognize the state of Israel, you condone killing israelis anywhere.   I do not know what was the pupose of the action you describe. If it was  to kill civilians (I doubt), I certainly DO NOT CONDONE IT. If civilians were  killed, i do not condone it.       Mr. Hernlem, it was YOU, not ME, who was showing a huge satisfaction for 3  israelis (human beings by most standards, Don't know about your standards) killed.  If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a  question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing justifies murder. I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ? Am I wrong ?   Now tell me, did you also condone Saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in, let's say, Tel Aviv ? From what I understand, a lot of palestineans cheered. What does it show? It does not qualify for freedom fighting to me ? But again, I may be  wrong, and the jewish controlled media distorted the information, and I am just an ignorant victim of the media, like most of us. \",\"============================================================================== Has anyone created any interesting animations using Dmorph I seem to be unable to create anything that looks remotely realistic although this is probably due to the crappy GIF's at I am using (One of Captain Kirk and One of Spock), i'm a bit of a 'Trekker'.

We would like to fire these three at a time with about 5 ms between firings. The three that are being fired do not fire in the same direction.   To further explain the situation, assume we are firing sonars A,B,C 5 ms apart each other. We should normally see an echo on A that corresponds to the distance. However, sonar A detects the INIT line of sonar B! The detection is actually through the transducer of sonar A; we can see a very faint 50Khz signal on the transducer, exactly at the time the init line of sonar B is activated.   We feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference. We came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply for sonars B and C.

It turns out that the mask is custom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his/her face through a piece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face and forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic wrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a plaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12 minutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the goalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves padding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.   John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show.

You are merely expressing \\\"approval\\\" of the consequences I find therein. Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my (or any) religion.  \\\"Love\\\" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians can write both the \\\"gentle\\\" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in a passage that even the \\\"conservatives\\\" will quote at you :-) -- and the words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \\\"Love is the unfamiliar Name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\\\"  This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise in my note, as will become more evident below.   blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though, given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of \\\"sin\\\" on another, and my unshakeable \\\"disestablishmentarianism\\\", Russel Turpin and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of Christian love.   You misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \\\"God\\\" in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:  The \\\"possibility that always exists\\\" is that I (or, to revert to proper time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could persuade \\\"Christian B\\\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian] prohibitions.  What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:   A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved      in the Inquisition.   B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however      painful this *seems*, \\\"discipline\\\" her children for their      own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or      if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example      \\\"deterring\\\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)   A.  I point out that this \\\"justification\\\" of a failure in love      depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of      philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.   B.  Burns me at the stake.  My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is going on here has a *lot* to do with \\\"cultural baggage.\\\"  In this case, the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B.  Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B, then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what- ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney.  So, \\\"one possibility\\\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in may others.  At the other extreme, the \\\"persuasion\\\" will succeed when it properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that many of the victims of Inquisition will have \\\"accepted\\\" that they were in fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them.)  The point is that the \\\"persuasion\\\" breaks down when the parties do NOT share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main thrust of the Inquisition, against \\\"heresy\\\", it is *bound* to break down in precisely the \\\"worst\\\" cases.  The \\\"conservative\\\" (I don't think that is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above, that he is \\\"justified\\\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to a \\\"greater good.\\\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow the gospel, as if one's theories about \\\"sin\\\" entitled one to cast aside Jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).  I am a \\\"radical\\\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.   Well, the whole *point* of making these the \\\"base\\\" commandments is that they *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \\\"Conservatives\\\" may twist this \\\"act as if you were God\\\" to mean \\\"lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.\\\" They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \\\"against God\\\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \\\"conservatives\\\" have confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.   And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged *different* \\\"ethical systems\\\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result, it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular (or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH. It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very little, if anything, in the way of \\\"commandments\\\" -- so little that the \\\"Christians\\\" who desperately *want* commandments go \\\"mining\\\" for them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-)) for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus specifically \\\"gives\\\" as \\\"a commandment\\\" to us is \\\"love one another.\\\"   [I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson   that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that   SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll   point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why   there is a huge amount of \\\"cultural baggage\\\" involved.]  You are quite right that this is \\\"goo\\\" if one is looking for an ethical system.  But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.   I think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity? [Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]\",\" If you write a second time to a CD you need to have multi-session capability to read the second session.  Whether it is photos or just data or whatever.  Here is a simplified way of looking at it: The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal' drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data.  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last directory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not taking multiple directories into account.\",\": They require two separate grounds.

Yup.   Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to  purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be one of the following: a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations:  The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.  The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any  organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions  to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are: - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.  - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.  Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).  The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members' use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet.   By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \\\"F\\\" motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart C, for details.  As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute, or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.  Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.   Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.   That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest misconceptions people have about our hobby.   True. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get  hit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand. \",\"I was posting to Alt.locksmithing about the best methods for securing  a motorcycle.

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.  Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch.  That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game, Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about  winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch.  Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible.  Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games.  I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.  But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan.    -- The Beastmaster   \",\"I am setting up a video-aid for a computer room for the teacher to share his display with the class.

On the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x,y positions are known.    Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron Danon's excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which converts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click the mouse.  Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values.  This is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process, scanner errors and what have you.  The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so \\\"global\\\" adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or rotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.  So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets of points   Reference(x,y) (the known true values)  DistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)  DistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)  what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to DistortedData to remove the errors.  I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a \\\"bumpy\\\" 3d surface, solving for the surface and then \\\"flattening\\\" it to remove the errors in the other data points.  Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet, pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?

Ville Siren's slap  shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi  scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal  put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.  The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo  made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,  during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.  Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to  Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered  the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund   skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.  Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line  where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since  there was traffic in front, 4-3.  Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \\\"the Shadow\\\" Nilsson. Stefan  and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to  Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.  Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only  21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone   with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja  made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.  The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal  late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,  showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck  and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.  But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the  game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow  angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.   All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.  Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period  to try no combinations.   Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-  Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.  Stillman good on defense.  Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner  hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson  will likely have to leave for NHL pros.   Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the  Finnish team.

I'm pretty happy with the results, but I'm looking for any already-coded non-linear interpolation schemes before I go ahead an try to write one.  Any pointers?  --\",\"  In order of your questions, I oppose it, I oppose it, I oppose it and (Huh?  Wha?  Where did _that_ topic come from and what's it got to do with the discussion at hand? :-)  When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes against different classes of people (and yes, I do consider laws which allow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the convict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit into that category), the category of classes I had in mind was that of the standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.  Having you ask about classes based upon one's _profession_ rather than one's personal characteristics caught me off guard, and I had to think out the question from scratch.  What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize such classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare some people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathema to the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.  Last year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plus crimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not protected by that \\\"aura of deterrence,\\\" critics pointed out the absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a civilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much more valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society. This was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents of that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their \\\"contribution to society.\\\"  I view that doctrine as being both (a) personally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment.  Accordingly, I believe that there should be no laws which give any profession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanism of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of that class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-ranking members of the Executive Branch of the federal government.\",\" The analogy does not depend on the premisses being true, because the  question under discussion is not truth but arrogance.   A similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood  transfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are  Jehovah's Witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood  transfusion. The doctor's efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood  transfusion could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as  Christians could be perceived to be arrogant.  The truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood transfusion is necessary  to save the life of the child is irrelevant here. What matters is that the  doctor BELIEVES it to be true, and could be seen to be trying to foce his  beliefs on the parents, and this could well be perceived as arrogance.\",\"I've been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers, notesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night at the Stick.  After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was  very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).  It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.  The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb. McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball. So on & so forth.  I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.  For myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year.\",\"The following is available in some FTP archive somewhere, I insert my comments liberally throughout this demonic memo of Big Brotherdom:      Look!

We'd have many more teams...centres that aren't as big (like Halifax or Adirondack....ok, so Halifax isn't a good example) would  eventually get promoted, and every team would be somewhat competetive within its own division (unlike Ottawa, SJ, Edmonton, etc.). Fans would eventually get rewarded for their loyalty (or penalized for their neglect), and the league would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx of newly promoted teams (and the Halifax Citadels win the Stanley Cup...I can dream, can't I??)

Its hard to predicatbaly drift a stock Mustang because of the suspension.   Yes. When i think Mustang, I think school-bus +  F16 motor. In my mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90 or so. It just isn't safe, check out your local junkyard, Mustangs outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in junkyards.  I find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the Mustang for poor brakes in relation to power. Ford should at least standardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 5.0's.     True of Northern Europe, latin countries are something else.  Kindof true. remember they were build by adolf in the '30's.   Yes.   \\\"Autobahn\\\" is the german word for freeway. Other countries have different names for loose equivalents; autostrada, autoroute, motorway etc.   Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn't passed as far as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than the US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred to the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more professional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.   You're wrong. GTI's  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal  autobahn car. A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers foot on the floor. How do I know? - when you're not making any ground on the identical car in front of you!   If something happens at 130-150 you're dead, but the same goes for much over 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much safer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic because most people seem to be awake.

Mr. Newman took him up on it.  Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast the next morning.  Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to people who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offer for Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, and so Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000.

The big problems I have encountered in porting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of invalid C++ assumptions.  I have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but the reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in which static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are getting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the owner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all other pieces of ctrltest work fine.  Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:  - The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,   rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ   between MSC and BC).  - All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++   assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place   of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for   references).  I am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have not encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope that some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS's hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that. \",\"Enclosed are the rules, guidelines and related information for the 10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest.

I didn't suggest that all  government regulations be subject to referenda.  So I don't follow the  comments above.   I mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally undesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw support among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate.  Furthermore, I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an industrial society because the weight of litigation and/or misery it would produce would effectively crush productive effort.  No, I'm not surprised.  I just think it's interesting that on one hand libertarians assume a limited government can be decreed, yet on the other posit an entire government made up of people who carry guns.  (I realize that many libertarians assume that such a government will be  counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry, but it is worth noting that widespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the establishment of totalitarian government, e.g. Iraq.)  Yup, sure do.  But since I also support the constitutional requirement that the government provide for the general welfare (Article I section 8), I'm willing to justify such programs on that basis.  Well, in the first place, I don't support a \\\"socialized economic system.\\\" I think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea.  But it is not the case that \\\"any third party...is...as likely to be ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller.\\\"  There are multitudes of examples where such a statement is demonstrably false.  Regulation of stock market transactions that provide a reasonable basis for buyers to avoid fraud is only one example.  jsh \",\"          ^^^^^^^^^^   Josh, were you in such a hurry?

How about quack diagnoses?  Is being a \\\"licensed physician\\\" enough to guarantee that someone is not a quack, or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack, other people shouldn't say so?

When one little country falls, its neighbor will surely follow, and before you know it, we're all mining salt in Siberia for not turning in our Captain Crunch Secret Decoder Rings.   Surely the hypothesis relying on the least wild assumptions is to take this at face value. Our lads at the fort were asked to cook up something that's pretty secure, with a key that can be escrowed neatly, and they did. The government plans to sell this thing, for the reasons they state. Yes, those evil guys in the FBI can probably, with some effort, abuse the system. I got news for you, if the evil guys in the FBI decide they want to persecute you, they're gonna, and you're gonna hate it. Fact is, the FBI doesn't want to listen to your phone calls, and if they do, and if you're using triple-DES, they'll just get a parabolic microphone and point it at your head.   This is pretty clearly an effort by the government to do exactly what they're saying they're doing. As is typical with governments, it's mismanaged, and full of holes and compromises. As is typical with our government, it's not too bad, could be worse.   My interpretation.

I'm looking into buying a serial port switcher, because while my Mac has two serial ports, I have AppleTalk, a modem, a printer, MIDI, and a sound digitizer.  (2 != 5, unfortunately.)     Specifically, I'm looking at the Axion electronic switcher, because it seems to be fairly cheap.  (About $128 at MacZone.)     Does anyone know anything about it?  I've heard that with most of these things you can still only use 2 serial ports at a time, it just prevents you from physically swapping cables.  Although I've also heard that programs that use the Comm Toolbox may be able to use as many serial ports as they want; does anyone know if this is true with the Axion switchbox?     Finally, if the Axion stinks, or if you're using something else that you think is good, I'd be interested in hearing about other products.  I would like to spend under $140, if possible.

One article contained a comment that the owner called the factory and was told that his screen rotation was within spec (1/4\\\").  Well, my monitor arrived last night and, sure enough, it has a very noticable barrel distortion. It's not dramatic, but it is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't fill the entire screen. The fact that it is worse on the right side doesn't help matters.  What I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? I don't want to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse problem. Does the factory consider this kind of thing normal and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment?

I am also interested in this subject -- I have a son with Epilepsy and I am very active with the local association.  I posted a message like this a few months ago and received no replies, but here it is again.  Is anyone interested in participating in a mailing list on Epilepsy and seizures?

This is part of my research on natural language question answering systems.  Users of this service are able to ask questions about Epilepsy and the program searches the database and retrieves its best response.

I don't particularly want this discussion to spark a lengthy debate, but I do think it's worth pointing out that \\\"popular usage\\\" is not always sufficient excuse.    In this case, for example, I think an appropriate parallel may be found in the pronunciation of proper names: if people commonly misspelled or  mispronounced your name, would you feel compelled to change it?  Probably not.    The same is true of X.  \\\"The X Window System\\\", \\\"X\\\", \\\"X11\\\", and related monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a proper name.  In fact, some of them are *trademarked* names.  The fact  that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point.    As for the trade publications that promulgate things like \\\"X Window\\\" or \\\"X.windows\\\" or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees,  consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by  *journalists*.  Would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn't be bothered to get the name of his/her source right?  Would you trust a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong?

Tep\",\"04/16/93 1045  ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES  By David Ljunggren  MOSCOW, April 16, Reuter - Armenia accused Turkey on Friday of flying weapons x and troops across Armenian airspace to Azerbaijan and strongly hinted it might try to shoot the planes down, local journalists in Yerevan said.  Separately, Itar-Tass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latest offensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions in the Transcaucasian region soaring.  The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan, head of the Armenian defence ministry press centre, as saying Ankara had been sending  planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops.  It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey about the impermissibility of such actions,\\\" the journalists quoted Duliyan as  saying.  \\\"If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate measures. We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft units.\\\"  Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in the conflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in which more than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.  The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to Azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.  A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly on a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket launchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.  Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops and arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from where they were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku.  \\\"All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the country which is affording military assistance over our airspace,\\\" he said.  Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops  involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.  Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive along the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front.  \\\"The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's) leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire,\\\" the agency said.  Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in Karabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of Commonwealth leaders.  \\\"The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the protection of the Karabakh population,\\\" Tass quoted him as saying.       At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have collapsed.  \\\"The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the legal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh,\\\" he said. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not  been recognised by any other country.  Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future peace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.  Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender Gamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with Armenia, had resigned.  Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office. Khabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of Baku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev. There was no official confirmation.  \",\"The SDIO has \\\"contracted\\\" with the NRL (Naval Research Laboratory) to fly the Clementine Mission.

I am on the TAMP (Trajectory Analysis & Mission Planning) team and am responsable for the IV&V of the traj that Goddard/CSC are designing.  As for why SDIO is doing it, some of the reasons are:     1)  the safety constraints are too tight to try to run the LIDAR in LEO     2)  in LEO we don't get any new radiation data on the sensors, we will get        that data on our 9 passages through the Van Allen (sp?)

The tips didn't pan out, but it was good hearing from you.

No help there. Then, not having anything better to try, I changed Normal IRQ to Delayed IRQ on the disk controller (didn't make any difference) and IOCHRDY_not_ driven to IDE_drive_controls_IOCHRDY (also had no effect).  So I put  everything back to the way it was and re-installed the cards.  I then unplugged the floppy drive cable from the disk controller.  Voila!, the PC booted from power up, although it seemed to take several seconds  before the first access to the hard disk.  Plug the floppy cable back to the controller and the original (non-boot) behavior returns.  O.K., with this additional information, does anyone in netland have any  words of wisdom for what's going on and how I should deal with it?\",\" Damn!

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper- work, and left for the Zhdanov District. That's in Azerbaijan, near the Nagorno Karabagh region.  After the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically in Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said \\\"uprising\\\" in Azerbaijani, but I don't think it was really an uprising, just a  demonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the  Zhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even  women; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here,  and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There were some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the Armenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site. I was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew  wouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really  bad. I didn't know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me, \\\"There's unrest everywhere, be careful.\\\" Well I had a project going on. I told the Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on  and said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn't allow it, they  said, \\\"Nothing's going to happen to you, we've entrusted the matter to the  police, we've warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.\\\"  Well, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he  knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This man didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and  afterward he spent the night with us, too.  I sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, \\\"The situation is very tense, be careful.\\\"  We finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the morning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I shouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else's business travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it  and my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus,  they sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out  they knew what was happening in Sumgait.  I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is closed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the  buses aren't running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two minutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private drivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, \\\"Let's go find some other way to get there.\\\" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to take us to Sumgait.  He took us there. But the others had said, \\\"I wouldn't go if you gave me a thousand rubles.\\\" \\\"Why?\\\" \\\"Because they're burning the city and killing the Armenians. There isn't an Armenian left.\\\" Well I got hold of myself so I could still stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we  set off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, \\\"In fact there aren't any Armenians left. 'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them.\\\" Well  I was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me,  \\\"How old are you, old man?\\\" He wants to know: if I'm being that quiet, not  saying anything, maybe it means I'm an Armenian. \\\"How old are you?\\\" he asks  me. I say, \\\"I'm 47.\\\" \\\"I'm 47 too, but I call you 'old man'.\\\" I say, \\\"It  depends on God, each person's life in this world is different.\\\" I look much older than my years, that's why he called me old man. Well after that he was silent, too.  We're approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon. Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he was waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I'm sitting there with them, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant there were no Armenians with us.  I look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the  street, you know, and there's no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They stopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature  shafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .  Along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's  not. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I'm an Armenian, but I speak  their language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for  \\\"nut,\\\" or \\\"little nut,\\\" as \\\"pundukh,\\\" but \\\"fundukh\\\" is actually correct. The  pronunciations are different. Anyone who says \\\"pundukh,\\\" even if they're not  Armenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says,  \\\"There was a car there, with five people inside it,\\\" he says. \\\"They started  hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn't let the people out,\\\" he says, \\\"they wouldn't let them get out of the car.\\\" I only saw  the car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from Baku to Sumgait and back . . .  When they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there's a short guy, his eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. \\\"We're Azerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no Armenians here.\\\" He did come up to me when  we were pulling our things out and says, \\\"Maybe you're an Armenian, old man?\\\"  But in Azerbaijani I say, \\\"You should be ashamed of yourself!\\\" And . . . he  left. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had  to . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own  home.  They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that's where the Kavkaz store  and three large, 12-story buildings are. That's the beginning of down-town. I  saw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I  couldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it  was a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing  remained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I saw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About 30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.  I see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are closed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the crowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots. Several shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier.  Someone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the  soldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one  armored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning  off Sumgait.  I walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by  their gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. I joined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us and asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see. But I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly  recognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer people. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block. I can't get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as  to get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking  behind him. And he's shouting into a megaphone: \\\"Comrades, the Armenian- Azerbaijani war has begun!\\\"  The police have megaphones like that. So they're talking and walking around  the second microdistrict. I see that they're coming my way, and turn off  behind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings,  and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every corner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were  doing I can't say, because I couldn't get up close to them, I was afraid. But  the most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least find out if my children were alive or not . . .

I got several requests to send the bindings per e-mail, and I know of several people who have been using Motif++, and there are probably a number of people I am not aware of who are also using Motif++.  My question is:  How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list, where people can ask questions about Motif++, swap stories, and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the user-community, as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project, and this way I can make a list of priorities, in what order things should be added, or changed.  If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list, please take the time to reply to this message, and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest, say about 20 people or more, a mailing-list will be set up at my site, and I will post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups.\",\"I have and use xrecplay for X11R5.

Not that it runs poorly normally, but on these days, it is exceptional.  My theory is that the air density and moisture content of the air are such that I get complete combustion.  Needless to say, it puts me in a great mood.  The mood lasted for about 20 miles.  Heading north on the 405 freeway, about a mile or two south of the 10, my throttle stopped responding.... and I was between lanes.  Nothing to do but make  my way over 4 lanes to the shoulder... initially by gliding, then by pushing.  At least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did not mind stopping for me.  Turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS40  carb.  I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws tight on a bike, but I never thought that I had to do that on the screws inside of a carb.  At least it was roadside fixable and I was on my way in hardly any time. ____________________________________________________________________________    Death is life's way of telling you you've been fired  -- R.

In most of  the present Macs there are external caches built-in while with IBM they are  optional {Though machines are generally sold with them installed}.  Since  there are many different external caches {CPU-Mac and IBM; SCSI, video, disk  and static RAM-Mac}, each having a different effect on CPU performance, and  they are machine {32KB static RAM cache in IIci, IIfx, and IIvx}, seller  {cache card installed in some IIcis} or expansion {IIci cache cards go up to  128KB} dependent, I have decided to leave them out of the list.

The 4MB limit on the 68000 Macs brings it  down to the 80186 and lower chips, otherwise it would compare to the 80286.}  286        ~ 68020 {hardware segmenting vs. 68020's 32-bit ALU and these chips  come have no usable built-in MMU unlike their successors [80386, 68030].  The  hardware segmenting's protected mode is used by OS/2 1.0 => and Windows 3.X.  The use of the hardware segmenting and their 16-bit nature put the 286 between  the 60000 and 68030 in features and the LC's 16-bit data path strenghthens the  286 ~ 68020 comparison.}  386       ~ 68030 {Two 32-bit chips with MMUs, and protected memory.  A/UX 3.0  is at present the only Mac OS to use the 68030's protected memory feature for  apps.  System 7.x uses this feature to protect a RAM disk created by the  Memory control panel but this is supported only on Powerbooks and Quadras.   The Color Classic and LCII 16-bit hardware data paths makes the 68030s in them  comparative to 386sxs.}  486sx   ~ 68LC040 {same as 486 and 68040 without the FPU; used as a low cost  solution for people who do not need the FPU.  Only with programs sensitive to   PCLK & pipelining does the 68LC040 behave like 486dx2 - FPU or a '486dx2sx'.}  486     ~ 68040 {two 32-bit microprocessors with built-in FPU, MMU, 8K  internal cache (which is implemented as two 4K caches in the 68040 and one in  the 486).  Only with programs sensitive to PCLK & pipelining does the 68040  behave like a 486dx2.}  Pentium   ~ 68060 {Both are planned to be superscalar but both have heat  problems.  These chips may flounder against the cheaper (PC Week 3/08/93;  4/12/93; PC Mag 4/27/93:110), earlier released (PC Week 12/7/92; MacWeek  12/14/92; PC Week 2/08/93), less leat producing {160 degrees F for Pentium (PC Mag 4/27/93:118)}, and partly ported to PowerPC chips.}   PowerPC   = PowerPC {This CPU line is planned to run programs from DOS,  Windows 3.x, OS/2 and Mac OS on top of PowerOpen-A/UX 4.0 [UNIX] and later  Pink [Taligent OS] by using emulators or, if necessary, the OSes themselves in  a 'shell' a.k. how SoftPC or OS/2 does DOS.}  Hardware  {In an effort to remove the 'reconfiguring the system almost every time you  add something' requirement for add-in cards, drivers, video, and operating  systems in the IBM world, Intel, Microsoft and 12 other hardware and software  developers are working out 'plug and play' standards (PC Week 03/08/93).} Color Support/Display  Mac: 30.24 MHz Pixel Clock standard.  All present Macs support the use of  32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw  allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y- bit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y  independently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63  dpi [12\\\" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including  autosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz  vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser  Aug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and  IIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit  color (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).   To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display  capability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit  color.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX  will change this. In addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one  monitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same  thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree  of overlap of the pictures. VRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of   built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit  color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display.  Sound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became   standard with the SE/30.  IBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system  interacts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing  BIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation of clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program  interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer  Jawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a  standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is  actually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like  Mac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes,  especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present  things are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver  and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS,  and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with  an IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2  486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0  and still have ALL the colors one started out with}. Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster  processors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD  ROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).   MDA: Monocrome Display Adapter  original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text. CGA: Color Graphics Array  320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes. EGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array  640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions   could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes. VGA:  Video Graphics Array*  320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are   the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a   18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock  (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals  from EGA/CGA etc.  MCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*  subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA   and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).    Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models. SVGA:  Super VGA*  This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch   all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer   using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating  as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a   standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things  are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution  of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since   1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600,   some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually   at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital   Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example],   some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting   factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were:   8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a   64K \\\"window\\\", etc. Other non-SVGA standards:  8514/a:  IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions   like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations   from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do   not have interlacing.  TMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some  do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD. XGA:  eXtended Graphics Array  newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones   are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at   1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes. XGA-2  Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in  Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area  fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-  exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be   far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth   isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other   companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh   rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual   discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2. *some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.  Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software  drivers.  \\\"Fast SCSI-1\\\" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode  {see SCSI-2 for details}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast  SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in    hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are  4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and  15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can  use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such  is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called \\\"fast SCSI-1\\\".   16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics  but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a  different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which  makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}. Mac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though   Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager  needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI  interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast   asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2  controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1))   though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port   interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus   Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some  Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard   and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager. IBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with   systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.  Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers  out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications  which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.  Mac Memory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin   8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs  could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity   feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx   used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new   72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.  The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every  memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will  not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.  Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs   had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris   650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that   allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same   size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting   in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109). Printers, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard. Monitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs.  PDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE,   Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.    Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650:   4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with  the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in   IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows   through put down. NuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,  and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:  40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and   Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a   Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet   to DMA. NuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:  ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7\\\" instead of the   old 12\\\". QuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's   VLBus - \\\"Architecture is identical to that of VLBus\\\" (Byte 10/92:128).  Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development. CPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,    Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at   the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to   dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each   NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with   8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.  IBM Memory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac- like SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.  HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:  MFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited  only used with smaller [\\u00b2 60mb] hard drives. IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.  currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive.  ESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface  ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in  many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of  hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1.   BUS interfaces {New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working  with old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).} ISA  8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a  16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).  1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,  hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards  aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}  while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's  showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit  (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.   MCA {Micro Channel}  IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; \\\"allows use of more than one CPU in a computer\\\"   (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components   involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA   and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido). EISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}  32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to   self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable   interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use. VESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}  Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}  250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus   mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for   video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of  their patents (Mel Martinez). QuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture  (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines  (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development. PCI  Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace   ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.  OSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.] and multiple application use.} Mac 512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows  Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw,  menu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require  clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires  access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM  chips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support  interface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS  has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and  therefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control  over hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with  some of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a  totally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon  Wtte). 6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy,   cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.    Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program   interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of   AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a   24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as   real RAM is below 8MB. 6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers. 6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X. 7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard   to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present   non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on  system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking   within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing   can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be   accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X},   Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable   IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType   support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present   machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is   both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit   mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last   'free' OS. 7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than   7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode   on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension.   Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades  {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.  [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system   fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any   RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all   fonts from the system file.] A/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and   a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS   is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac   ROMs.  Price: $709. Note: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats  including the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and  DCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd'  and AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most  still play.  IBM  Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for  programmers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.   Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition,  what little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}   This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or  EPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to  better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which  is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it  reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware  support is needed. Side note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing  all feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing  its Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 (\\\"Undocumented Windows\\\") and  \\\"There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to  abort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present\\\" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92  #201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC  judicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no  action.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of  choosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has  turned down Microsoft's copyright of \\\"Windows\\\" which would allow it to charge  a fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93). MicroSoft OSes DOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier   with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program   must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS   Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit   Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in  DOS 4.0. DOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk   defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for   networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99}   (Byte April 1993:44-46). DOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93). Window 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to   deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to  run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the  equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].  This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac  programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and  still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed  is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).  Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS  counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108). Window 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base   requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx.   Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92). Windows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).    Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1   with built-in peer to peer networking support. Windows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the   swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in   the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the   reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM   but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).  This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric   multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in  networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even  though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor  is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993  (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993  (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495  (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93). Other OSes PC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS   6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93). DR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression}   and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later   version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple   file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92). OS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,  60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded,   multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file   to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}.   IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this   (InfoWorld Oct 26/92). AIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS. NeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final   version to be out by May 25, 1993. Solaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric   multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with   tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and   communication package.  Client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users  server: $5,995.  Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195. Mac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel   Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM   (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run   on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps   will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to   Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow   progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in   late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}  PowerPC Rumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92;  MacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA  video (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week  3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps. Apple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and  to have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to  sale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser  9/92:146)} (MacWeek 3/22/93). PowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on  PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain  (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard  drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.  Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993. Pink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92)   and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and   PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93). Windows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details. Solaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the  Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state   that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details NeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.  OS Number Crunching (Mel Park) Mac  Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard  Apple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an  FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or  taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are  handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal  representation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment  of 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and  the FPU programmed directly.  IBM  Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when  emulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever  compiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers  exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS  prompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this  better.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS,  Windows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.  Networking [Includes printing] WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially  if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer. Mac Hardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.   LocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for  each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to  include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in  Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at  about $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and  transceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet. The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet  interface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a  network option since 1989. Software: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can  use variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS  as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open,  Banyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing  machines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows  typical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version  will have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993  (MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC  Pathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software  built-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra.  Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in  the chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the  chooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers. Printing bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.  {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}  IBM   Hardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing. Software: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk  protocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}. Each of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible  with the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to  that product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more  forgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest,  {~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and  offers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more  complex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac  finder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;   InfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93) Printing {Very OS dependent} DOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port,   and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written   software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly   implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one   software program to the next. Windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing \\\"jobs\\\"   in the print queue, but it always lists printers as \\\"active\\\"... even if they   are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers   on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine   which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like   and intelligent about this. OS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS. Printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do  not have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and  not that of the OS involved.  Price issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features  than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars  by both worlds. The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware  standarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to  handle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac  hardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,   built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and  NuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent  equipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs  which cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.  Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993. All Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.  Except where  noted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card  needed except for 24-bit color display}. IBM planned a $1,200 386SLC/25MHz model with a 60MB hard drive and color VGA  monitor {~VRAM} (MacWeek 8/17/92) {sounds like a Color Classic without SCSI-1,  sound support, built-in network support, FPU socket, built-in expansion to  16-bit color, etc}. Color Classic:  $1,389 - 030/16MHz with 16-bit data bus {~386sx/20MHz  equivalent}, 4/80, FPU socket, and built-in monitor. LCIII: $1,499 - 030/25MHz {~386dx/33MHz equivalent}, and 4/160. Centris 610: $2,899 - 68LC040/20MHz {Depending on the program ~486sx/40 or  ~'486dx2sx'/20[40]MHz equivalent}, 8/230, built-in ethernet, 300i CD-ROM, a  PDS/NuBus 90 slot and VRAM for 16-bit color. Centris 650: 040/25MHz {Depending on the program ~486dx/50 MHz or 486dx2/50  MHz equivalent} with a PDS and 3 NuBus 90 slots. $3,189 {ethernet, 8/80};  $3,559 {ethernet, 8/230}; $3,999 {ethernet, 8/230, CD-ROM, VRAM for 16-bit  color}  Bibliography notes 'Vaporware' is available in the digest/vapor directory by FTP on sumex- aim.stanford.edu [36.44.0.6] and was by Murphy Sewall {last issue: April 93.} 'Info-IBMPC Digest' back issues are available from wsmr-simtel20.army.mil in  directory PD2:<ARCHIVES.IBMPC> 'Dictionary of Computer Terms 3rd ed.'

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean an \\\"air core resonant transformer\\\". The TV flyback version Tesla coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called \\\"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit\\\" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors, which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat, gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and telegraph for communication.

Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain X. Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.

Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)? * What are the US export regulations? * What is TEMPEST? * What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax? * What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch? * Is RSA patented? * What about the Voynich manuscript?   * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?    The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It   was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and   has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is   known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,   and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the   world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of   cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many   years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break   many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national   security almost all information about the NSA is classified.    Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of   the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the   difference between public and private research in cryptography:    ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,   one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted   behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged   today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of   those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10   years has there in fact been widespread open research in   cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts   between these two research communities. Open research is common   quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open   exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in   scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with   responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,   countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can   a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might   undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?   One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would   force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one   must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with   political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most   scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have   occurred between government agencies and open researchers in   cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which   we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''  * What are the US export regulations?    In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control   export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export   Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by   the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office   of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized   by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule   of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent   requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see   everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.    The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting   discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what   people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which   go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to   consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in   jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at   least heard of the ITAR.  * What is TEMPEST?    TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer   equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that   information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at   quite a distance and with little effort.    Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext   is available this way.  * What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?    (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for   corrections.)    The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas   Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass   of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving   three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the   location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.   Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;   it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the   Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;   many documents have been tried as the key to B1.    Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various   means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:    The Beale Cypher Association   P.O. Box 975   Beaver Falls, PA 15010    You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the   line:    send index    in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.   (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher   floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,   says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)    Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of   problems with the story.

The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis   on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with   pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes   articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in   English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,   Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.    Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;   less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent   to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.  * Is RSA patented?    Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.   For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been   granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral   issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information   about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of   the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as   ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other   technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.  * What about the Voynich manuscript?    nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the   subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list   is: <voynich-request@rand.org>    the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich\",\"I have a wonderful Commodore 128 for sale!!!!

(Sorry all HP fans, but I have a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their (excellent) gear).  One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is whether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock the instrument into real time capture mode.   I agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus. However, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students) seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or more knobs required of a \\\"real\\\" scope :-)   This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at least they appear to be logically laid out.  One more thing about the new, \\\"simpler\\\", front panels. These instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the instruments.

My suspicion jumps to this damn all in one HD controller/serial/ parallel/game-port I/O card, or to the motherboard (God forbid).   CAN ANYONE HELP?\",\"  No. The issue is reducing crime, not guns. If gun control doesn't lower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue.   Does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much more common? Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the threat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim  in an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not be as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually _use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.) It isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a knife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more common. That's why it is important to look at the overall (not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of substitution, different criminal techinques of using different weapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.   \\\"Face\\\"? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn't too common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the usual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts to much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your pockets. Overall, I'd much rather be threatened with a gun than actually stabbed with a knife.   Actually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training in unarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman  without much problem.  You also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National Crime Survey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a knife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives in a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almost all prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore, using (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case) a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless of how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effective than guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a \\\"serious threat\\\" nearly as often as they do guns.\",\"Could some kind soul out there e-mail me the 411 on where I can find the mlb.c   program?

It would be stupid to rely on even a \\\"Clipperized\\\" channel for truly  sensitive material, but it *does* seem to finally offer a reasonable way to  guard against casual eavesdropping.  For example, even with my strong \\\"right  to bear arms\\\" view of the private right to possess and use strong  cryptosystems, the system as described provides enough security that I would  actually buy a cordless phone, and would be much less wary of using cellular  phones, walkie-talkies, and so on.

Neil Smith                             WEIRD SCIENCE  Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips  move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are  politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase  \\\"political science\\\" is subject to more than one interpretation.    Years ago, we heard how \\\"scientists\\\" were worried that a new Ice  Age might be coming, and later on that \\\"nuclear winter\\\" -- smoke  and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international  unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even  have killed the dinosaurs.    What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this,  that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended  to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken  values that made America the most successful culture in history,  and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague  when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.    We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William  Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't  supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least  100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never  know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit  their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and  that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.    But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of  science as they are of everything, they trust \\\"scientists\\\" to  unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \\\"scientists\\\"  have agendas of their own.    Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is  going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that  there is no respectable evidence for \\\"global warming\\\".  The money  and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and  they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical  crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.    The same appears true of \\\"acid rain\\\", a deliberate hoax cooked up  by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private  industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and  foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on  specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.    The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.   \\\"Ozone depletion\\\", for which evidence is even more suspect and  contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than  a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era  when state central planning and the command economy have failed and  can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.    Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth  and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear  power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy  known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount  of energy there is available to any individual in society, the  freer that individual -- and his society -- become.    Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and  self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as  ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive  reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have  been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.    And what the media didn't say about recent EPA \\\"discoveries\\\" on the  effect of \\\"secondhand smoking\\\" is that, although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of  magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a  week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether  there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.    That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically  correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice  to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy  practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's  science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is  highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet  the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There  isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of  government money on the scientific establishment.    Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies  to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one  time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and  religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has  tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of  abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street  -- has wound up being shed.    Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's  lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of  livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate,  to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels  for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates,  when they die from the effects of obesity.    What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two  more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of  state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable;  real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will  simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and  everyone will benefit.    L.

Also, my Calvinist should rest assured that I don't lay any of the responsibility for the outcome [my conversion] on anyone but God.)

Image analysis software - Image processing and display ==========================================================  PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software) ======================  IMDISP ------   IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,   enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS   data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions   [PC and Macs]  LabVIEW 2 ---------   LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   \\\"program\\\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even   hole filling.    The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.    GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,   documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been   developed by Spyglass.    Spyglass, Inc. 701 Devonshire Drive Champaign, IL  61820 (217) 355-6000   fax: 217 355 8925  NIH IMAGE ---------   Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably)   zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.   It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,   tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting   things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of   images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined   convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw   data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also   does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,   though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac   that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version   from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)  PhotoMac --------   Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700  PhotoPress ----------   Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973  PixelTools and TCL-Image ------------------------   \\\"Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications   software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

It is easily   extensible through \\\"script\\\" (or indirect command) files. These script   files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are   executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.   The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame   grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides   conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF.\\\"    Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville, TN 37933 615-966-9200  Satellite Image Workshop ------------------------   It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all   sorts of image enhancing on it. You'll need at least a Mac II with co-   processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn't   run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1    In the documentation the contact address is given as:  Liz Smith, Jet   Propulsion Laboratory, MS 300-323, 4800 Oak Grove Dr,.Pasadena, CA 91109   (818) 354-6980  Visualization Workbench -----------------------   \\\"An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image   analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting.\\\"    Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112  Adobe Photoshop ---------------    The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey   scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,   blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,   EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,   PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the \\\"auto selection tool\\\"   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close   hues, color range and mask.

Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283  Digital Darkroom ----------------   The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and   editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by \\\"painting\\\" it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator \\\"paint\\\" with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd., Suite J San Diego, CA   92126 619-695-6956  Dimple ------   It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or   II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has   the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image   enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and   unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There   is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write   your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however   Dimple is compatable with MAPII.

Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: \\\"Laplacian, medium noise filter\\\", etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,   the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

It will handle most all of the formats used by frame grabber   software.   MIRAGE ------   It's image processing software written by Jim Gunn at the   Astrophysics Dept at Princeton. It will run on a PC among other platforms.   It is a Forth based system - i.e. a Forth language with many image   processing displaying functions built in.   DATA TRANSLATION SOURCE BOOK ----------------------------   The Data Translation company in Massachusetts publishes a free book   containing vendors of data analysis hardware and software which is   compatible with Data Translation and other frame grabbers.   Surely you can find much more PC-related stuff in it.  MAXEN386 --------   A couple of Canadians have written a program named MAXEN386 which does   maximum entropy image deconvolution. Their company is named Digital   Signal Processing Software, or something like that, and the software is   mentioned in an article in Astronomy Magazine, either Jan or Feb 92   (an article on CCD's vs film).   JANDEL SCIENTIFIC (JAVA) ------------------------   Another software package (JAVA) is put out by Jandel Scientific.    Jandel Scientific, 65 Koch Road, Corte Madera, CA 94925, (415) 924-8640,   (800) 874-1888.  Microbrian ----------   Runs on an MS dos platform and uses a 32 bit graphics card   (Vista), or an about to be released version will support a number of   super VGA cards.  Its a full blown remote sensed data processing   system.. It is menu driven (character based screen), but is does not use   a windowed user interface. Its is hardware protected with a dongle.   Mbrian = micro Barrier reef Image Anaysis System.

Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu   (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)   Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,   VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic, etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is   available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - \\\"AIPS++\\\" - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and   Australia to name a few.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using   the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.

Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,   automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to   byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically   and carefree.    It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that   difficult to write your own with their programmer's module.    Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells.

Supports 24-bit display\\\"  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil   exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual   pages, and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.   For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun   console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X   windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of   convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]    MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,    byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or    without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,    line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp    masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,    line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan    bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to    region target mean, median, or modal value. o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,    brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive    background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical    aperture shape to image isophotes.  o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot    of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`    centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,    change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and    adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function    or histogram equalization. o  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for    registration. o  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or    2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers    can be cycled through. Interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting,    point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and    quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights    or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass    back to calling function. Dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars)    to file or printer.

In addition to the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another set integrated into the front turn signal assembly.

On the other hand, I could be wrong and perhaps the game card designers splurged for the extra $.50 to make a cheap constant current source out of an op amp.

Otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix.   An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always   available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community, however, I'm not   really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting   (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, C library or compiler patches come   out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for   all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license.   Hence, Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.

BUT the slight problem with this, which makes the solution less than idea, is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments.  So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to image.

Will the higher : resolution be noticed for these? :  If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript. I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript. It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation processed PS.  The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.  We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's demo though).

In fact, for the Bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use.  The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.  It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo- Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man.  This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers have done).  Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I think the important aspect is the result.

B2:      Male sex survey: Gay activity low      A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough     examination of American men's sexual practices published since     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and     1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.      The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday     by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than     the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional     wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.  The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners. The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3. Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson, and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general male population.  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.\",\"Can anyone help me find any information on the drug Prozac?

We always came home with a nasty case of jiggers (large red bumps where the buggers had burrowed into the skin). My mother would paint the bumps with clear finger nail polish. This was repeated daily for about a week or so. The application of the polish is supposed to suffocate them as it seals of the skin. All I can say is it worked for us. One word of caution though. Putting finger nail polish on a jigger bite stings like hell.  (If I do get flamed for this just put jam in my pockets and call me toast.:) \",\"   The word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the \\\"B\\\" word, or the \\\"H\\\" word, or even the \\\"N\\\" or \\\"W\\\" words. It is the \\\"L\\\" word - LOSER !!   That's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it is all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.   Remember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail buffer can claim they are \\\"too young\\\" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet. The eighties were about \\\"How America Learned to Win Once Again\\\". Then (wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win. No Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer (We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no holds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a few \\\"little\\\" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an S&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to contend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never had it so good.    In the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one doesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a \\\"kinder and gentler type of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of discourse about people who \\\"don't get it\\\". For those of us in the winning business, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no  suggestion of losing.   But what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our  \\\"white male\\\" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out  photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one with a \\\"Hail Mary\\\" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'three yards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses in the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the  weapon of choice these days.     Who is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on  your face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This  is known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt  sure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the  same. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to  take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?   What we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is  the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood used to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott declaimed, \\\"Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will  not tolerate a loser.\\\" And so on.    The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and Democrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some  \\\"equitable\\\" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a  loser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian homosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%)  minority.   Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most conservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care who's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say something about make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition). In the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a  \\\"neoconservative\\\" or a \\\"neoliberal\\\" depending on how much you want to limit the pot.   Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be popular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still be popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I  would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it is the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any other place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in Columbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to  see more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious  preference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of  them be white men !! (We should DEFINITELY let the Buckeyes win the Rose Bowl someday)    Bill R.  --\",\"you also need to set the correct switch settings on your xt controller, which can be a pain, since most pc's don't come with proper docs for all hardware contained inside it.  \",\"From Israeline 4/14  Today's MA'ARIV reports that yesterday, following Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's meeting with PLO Chief Yasser Arafat and prominent Palestinian Faisal al-Husseini, the latter said that in principle, the Palestinians have decided to participate in the peace talks.

The particular need in this case is for three machines, each in a different office of the same building, each having access to a Windows-based accounting system.  My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of the machines (likely a 486 and two 386's) along with the appropriate Ethernet cards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit (one additional user kit will be necessary).  It then seems logical to purchase a simple multi-user accounting system, along the lines of DacEasy or M.Y.O.B., and fire it all up!  The 486 will more or less act as server with a report/check printer attached to it. Cable runs of 30-40 feet will be necessary for this setup.  Well, this all seems too easy to me.

Once the tax is imposed, it becomes a federal matter and suspicision of an unlicensed cryptographic tool will bring the BATF or FBI tossing grenades into your house.  (The BATF appears to be the logical agency to enforce such regulations: federal control over alocohol, tobacco, and firearms is similary based on taxes.)  Look at the FCC: they won't allow sale of any receiever that can receive bands that are supposed to be private.  This has nothing to do with any desire to prevent harmful interference.

Fred is basically correct:  no sophisticated tools, just a lot of effort and painstaking care.  But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (He also noted that the software people were starting to feel management pressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)  Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get things right for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failure during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure. As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be counted on one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.  As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software. Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the experimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care. (None of the experimenters could afford it.)\",\"What size dirtbikes did you ride? and for how long? You might be able to slip into a 500cc bike.

Here is some  information \\\"from the horse's mouth\\\".  (Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (\\\"clearing\\\") meant to  be *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying  the material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,)  From National Telecommunications and Information Systems  Security (NTISS) \\\"Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation  Security Guidelines\\\"  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87):  ------  \\\"7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk,  cassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the  entire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be  cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that overwrites  each location with a given character.  Fixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting  at least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by  applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each  location on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that  this program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware:  some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not  actually do this.  Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or  released for destruction; however, they should be marked and  controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of  information ever recorded.  7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a  degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of  that type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)  If a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is  operative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to  employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all  addressable locations at least three times by writing any character,  then its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros)  alternatively.  When fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify  the media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two  alternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk  pack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved  degaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the  vendor's facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter)  removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for  destruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new  platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.  7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media\\\"  [see DoD Computer Security Center, \\\"Department of Defense Magnetic  Remanence Security Guideline\\\", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE  ONLY]  ------  This and many other interesting documents (many that are more  informative than probably intended) on computer security procedures  can be obtained (free) from:  Executive Secretary National Telecommunications and Informations   Systems Security Committee National Security Agency Fort George G.

Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS/2 2.0 any longer. If you wish to install the beta from the CD/ROM, you will need to REM out the Adaptec device drivers, as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic cards when OS/2 attempts to use them. (Thanks Adaptec!)   So you add the BusLogic drivers to the config.sys on the CD-ROM boot disk, and REM out the Adaptec drivers.  Then you install the whole 1st half of the Beta.. and it won't work! IBM nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again. (Thanks IBM!) So.. REM out the Adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot. If you have everything in the right order.. it will work.  Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except OS/2 will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end... so.. you are off to more REM statements and more fun.   The BT 542Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that do not come with drivers. The DOS drivers work great. This card can easily be configured to work with 8 different sets of I/O ports (and you can use multiple host adapters in one machine) If you get a new card.. it will also be able to support up to 8 GB drives under DOS.

I merely said that he isn't the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor. If Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup by now- probably more than once.  If he was as great a GM as you claim and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success. But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM so none of this is true anyway.\",\"   A human has greater control over his/her actions, than a  predominately instictive tiger.

My opinion, FWIW, to all:  Mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las Vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major league hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have the league data from the mid-80s to check it out.  That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers, they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around .220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on the Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at any level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.

But he has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more valuable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24), had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor, EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF (which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching his \\\"prime\\\" season of 27.

So you say palestineans do not negociate because of 'well-founded' predictions ? How do you know that they are 'well founded' if you do not test them at the  table ? 18 months did not prove anything, but it's always the other side at  fault, right ?  Why ? I do not know why, but if, let's say, the Palestineans (some of them) want ALL ISRAEL, and these are known not to be accepted terms by israelis.  Or, maybe they (palestinenans) are not yet ready for statehood ?  Or, maybe there is too much politics within the palestinean leadership, too many fractions aso ?  I am not saying that one of these reasons is indeed the real one, but any of these could make arabs stall the negotiations.    I like California oranges.

I have seen modules that you plug into your wall outlet that \\\"supposedly\\\" make your entire house an antenna.  I have to admit, even with my limited knowledge of wavelength and aerial reception, this seems dubious in its claims for \\\"excellent reception\\\" at best.  I'll try anything, though, if it WORKS.  I am in a non-mountainous area, approximately 50 miles from the transmitting stations which are pretty large (Montgomery Alabama pop. 200,000) and Colombus Goergia, pop. 100,000+.

All Scripture is true, being inspired by God.  The evidence for this claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group.  Similarly, all truth is absolute.  Indeed, a non-absolute truth is a  contradiction in terms.  When is something absolute?  When it is always true.  Obviously, if a \\\"truth\\\" is not always \\\"true\\\" then we have a contradiction in terms.    Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a statement is terribly self-contradictory.  Let me put it to you this way.  If there are no absolutes, shouldn't we conclude that the statement, \\\"There are no absolutes\\\" is not absolutely true?  Obviously, we have a contradiction here.  This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming that there are indeed absolutes in the universe.   So?  People sometimes disagree about what is true.  This does not negate the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  Moreover, evangelical Christianity, at least, still professes to believe in certain truths.  Man is sinful, man needs salvation, and Jesus is the propitiation for mankind's sins, to name a few.  Any group that does not profess to believe these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical.  \",\" The ADC is an organization of Arab-*AMERICANS*.  Let me see...you're saying that \\\"most if not all\\\" Arab-AMERICANS should be spied on?  You're also saying that \\\"most if not all\\\" Arab-AMERICANS should be views as a national security threat to Israel (and the US,  as you gratuitously imply in your reference to the WTC bombing, in  which no Arab-AMERICANS were involved)?  By inference, can we assume  that you think that anyone of Arab lineage anywhere in the world poses  a threat to Israel and, therefore, should be spied on?  Perhaps, then, on the basis of Pollard spy case (not to mention the Rosenbergs, etc.) you think that all Jewish Americans should be spied  on by the ADC.  Oh, never mind; this whole spying case has obviously so  convoluted your sense of right or wrong in these matters that I have  no wish confuse you further.   So the LA times reporter who had information about him sold to the South African government was involved in \\\"anti-Israel activity or propaganda\\\"?

The LA  times reporter was based in South Africa, after all.   \",\"  As a libertarian (with a small l) who voted for Clinton, I think that he should abolish the Selective Service and the draft.  If his conscience forbade him to go to war in Vietnam, it should forbid him to perpetuate this system of government-sanctioned slavery.   If our government would pay attention to SERIOUS domestic issues (the ECONOMY) and choose to stay out of other people's wars (Iraq, Bosnia, Somalia), we would not be in this fix.  An anyway, couldn't the jobs be replaced by improving our domestic situation?  (I'm not for continued deficit spending, but if Clinton and Congress want to spend, I'd rather they improve the  infrastructure than fight other people's wars.)   A novel idea:  Getting away from naval bases, what about refurbishing decommissioned Air Force bases as airports?  This would be SO much cheaper than building them from the ground up (Denver's new airport is one of the  most appalling examples of pork-barreling and cronyism I have seen in my lifetime).  Even if no more airports are needed, I'm sure Bill Gates or Ross Perot would LOVE to have their own private airfields, and the money from their purchases could be applied to the public debt. \",\"  What I did NOT get with my drive (CD300i) is the System Install CD you listed as #1.

The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically modified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks. Later model 2600 might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weight of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.  Additionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM for their games. I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I would hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. Think comes from a lot of hacking with the 800 and 130xe computers. And occasionally hacking with the 2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups). Also I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM into a RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way to backup cartridges). I've heard of a setup like this where games could be bought (cheaply) on FSK-recorded tapes, then you would load them into a special RAM cartidge, and play them.  Anyways, if you're interested in looking for 2600 equipment, we've got two 2600 machines around (one composite A/V modified), and lotsa cartridges.

Israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave when the Lebanese government shows that it can prevent attacks on Israel, and when the Syrians agree to leave.

The question you ask is complicated and deserves an honest answer. I am going to provide one from my own current perspective, not a historical one.  Currently, as a non-observant jew/Israeli/American, my own feeling is that Jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in Palestine or Israel, than the palestinians or Israelis (both arab and jew) do. With regard to Jewish Israelis, they should have the same rights in Israel as do all other Israelis.   Who are them?  If by them you mean the non-religious Jews, I think you should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their supporters are religious.  The other part of the problem is, to my knowledge, not that the palestinians don't want to be a part of Israel, as much as they would accept (for the most part) being full citizens of Israel, with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded Israeli citizens.  What they object to is the current limbo in which they find themselves.  \",\"  Be warned, it is not my job to convert you.  That is the job of the Holy Spirit.  And I, frankly, make a lousy one.

Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft), and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.  How about measuring vertical distance as well, any chance - or am I getting ridiculous?  What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call Japan, etc.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would greatly appreciate your sending it to me.  Thanks.\",\"   Just as a matter of interest, a self-promo computer graphics sequence  that one of the local TV stations used to play quite a lot a couple of years ago showed a 3D flyover of Australia from the West coast to the East.  The clouds were quite recognisable as fuzzy, flat, white Mandlebrot sets!!\",\"  First of all, I resent your assumption that you know why I am threatened by science, or even that I am threatened at all, although I admit the latter.  The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence-- God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree, Science.   My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations, for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone. Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have  children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that is made possible.   People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death, and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world.   This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely  prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary  alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,   go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us?   I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not, but I will say this:  Before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body they have been given, they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to  believe their search is displeasing to God.\",\" They detect the oscillator operating in the detector.

Sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long, and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique. Or so I thought.  I went to Tuesday's game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the 'Stick was  a much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but  everything is a lot better. The lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms are CLEAN and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite.   The new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fence are very nice, as are the new bleachers. The bleachers start right at the top of the fence and give a great view, and they've got beer stands at the bottome of the bleachers. The only complaint is that the electronic  old-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better.  These things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real  businessman (ex - Safeway President Peter Magowan) to figure it out.

Most of these quotations are of people who do beleive.  People who would try to justify their own positions.  Second the logical proof:    The period of time that has elapsed from the event growing larger does not increase the odds that a hoax would be discovered.

If most people }use scissors to cut paper, shouldn't Consumer's Reports }test scissors for paper-cutting ability, even though }scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?  That's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching Jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version is what was \\\"enlightened for its times\\\". To (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for their times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even heard of paper.  I'm not arguing that the Bible is \\\"disgusting\\\", though some of the history depicted in it is, by modern standards.  However, history is full of similar abuses, and I don't think the Biblical accounts are worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  On the other hand, I don't know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries, or ours.  That complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting, but I still don't think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history.\",\" :  really involved there).

I agree completely, driving drunk is really stupid, and I understand and appreciate that you feel bad about it.  But DWI is endemic in our society.  It is a REAL problem.  And we, as  motorcyclists, can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk driver.  (Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI accident (right bloody in front of me), and was unable to save the life  of one of the participants, as I reported here.)  Also, drunk driving by motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death, which raises the insurance rates, forces stupidly restrictive laws, and turns the public against those of us who ride responsibly.  In my view, drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence. It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue, but a genuine safety issue.  So if YOU bring up the subject on rec.moto, admitting having been caught DWI, and looking for sympathy over the  consequences, don't expect people to respond with warm wishes.\",\" Oh, that must explain Matthew 18:  1) In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, \\\"Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\\\" 2) And he called to him a little child, and set him in the midst of them, 3) and said, \\\"Verily I say unto you, Except ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. 14) Even so it is not the will of your father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.

Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; you shall not do any work - you, your son or daughter, your male or female slave, or your cattle, or the stranger who is within your settlements. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth and sea, and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and hollowed it.

The sad truth is: sometimes that is good, or at least, better than the alternative.   Ok.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the number has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these accidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.  ...  In fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that.  The idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber handgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense, would, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't why I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it, and might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to kill people.   In fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses of firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer not to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what you say when you point a gun at them.  If you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to immediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work the best.[3]   Certainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing) aren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of them were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with having deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to use deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right, but my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and knowing how to use the tools to do that.  \\\"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\\\"  - T. Jefferson.  I think what Jefferson said is still true.   Not very often compared to other use.[3]   This isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly \\\"get-pissed\\\" and kill someone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long histories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these people wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.   Right, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I never have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from rodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than is necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them to drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that, I don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and ammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm after, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point, people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns, particularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.

In 1932, the accidental deaths by firearm per  1,000,000 people was 24.03. In 1987, it was 5.74. The decline has been  steady, consistent, and a fairly straight line when plotted. At the rate  of the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD.  CONCLUSION ========== Firearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over  sixty years, despite rising per-capita gun ownership.    [1] = Year. [2] = Population. [3] = Accidental deaths. [4] = Accidental deaths per 1,000,000.

THe purpose of the group will be to provide help to people who use Access's  WYSIWYG design tools to create simple databases as well as to people who use  Access Basic to create complex databases.  RATIONALE: Eventhough Access is a new RDBMS, it is very popular because of its Graphical Development enviroment and its initial low price.

In case of the Earth z is about 23.5 degrees, I think. I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus, z is almost 90 degrees.  u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured. Paris is at about 45 degrees.  North pole is at 90.  a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from 0 to 360 degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun. The spring equinox occurs at a=0.  L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day). On the equator (u=0) L is always 1/2.  Near the north pole (u=90 degrees) L is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.  Computation: Define the auxiliary angles p and q by: sin p = sin a sin z cos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       (0 < q < 180 degrees)  Conclusion: L = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees) L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)  Wait!

How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the person claiming to be IT is obviously insane?  I'm not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ.  How could somebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming?  Koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast.  He didn't.  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people.  And, from my meagre knowledge of the Bible, it seems that Christians have been hard on the Jews of Christ's day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the Messiah.  So I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the Second Coming while, at the same time, not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God.  [Mark 13:21   And then if any one says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!'  or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.

My understanding of Jesus' answer is that, unlike his first coming, which was veiled, the second coming will be quite unmistakeable.  He's telling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen before his second coming -- the actual second coming will make his power openly visible.  By the way, from Koresh's public statement it's not so clear to me that he is claiming to be Christ.\",\"Jonathan E.

In retrospect I would also like to quote another source: Douglas C. Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_  THERAPY INEFFECTIVE  Recently the founders of yet another prominent \\\"ex-gay\\\" ministry, Exodus International, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective. Michael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and lovers for 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The program was described by these men as \\\"ineffective . . . not one person was healed.\\\"  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed \\\"reparative therapy.\\\"  The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June 30, 1992 called \\\"The Ex-Ex-Gay\\\" by Robert Pela.  Some personal thoughts:  It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among its ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even later, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and segragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings. Today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is still coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind control, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than God sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt thier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \\\"physically\\\" forced to stay in this \\\"reparative therapy\\\" but sheer social pressure is enough for many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.  As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution against gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by the contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live, not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t a clue what is in their heart.

Today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique I'd never seen before.  He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil. The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray, made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.  In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.  On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.  Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises and concerns me are:  1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?  2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color     (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring     agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected     it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,     caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being     used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?  3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated     as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract     from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever     happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea     could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do     so.  WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens), I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips, getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process, then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.  My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff, just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?  I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.  And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually has some standing, don't know about the others.\",\"Since the losers that sold me the hard disk for my computer are so generous, I need the info to set this drive from master to slave.

Without delving into a deep discussion of : >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code : >>perfect and without flaw.  : >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~  Do you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and has degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement, shouldn't we?  Perhaps the biggest \\\"imperfection\\\" of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains.  Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes.   On the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted later, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused, if introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated, since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are conserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and these are not found in or near intron sequences.   I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting \\\"theological arguments\\\" like this.  Try Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish & Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.  : Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does : God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a : theological perspective -- my own.

Would you please cite a few references that support your assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective, unless you support it by some evidence.  In fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we've thought - for instance, sex might have evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by computer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.)    : Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma : rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.

I'd replace \\\"created\\\" with \\\"formed\\\", since there is no need to  invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one. Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8 billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.

I hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests  everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against this conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in  anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the  right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so, and not to present one's own conclusions prior to this.   Theology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions.  : >>Human DNA, being more \\\"complex\\\", tends to accumulate errors adversely : >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the  : >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  : >>causing infection and disease.

Bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators from degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to  survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it  to the present.   And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection, and thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either claim.   : But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in : answering John's question of why?

The problem is, it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution.  : Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference. : Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the : point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I : never said that people are \\\"meant\\\" (presumably by God) \\\"to be : punished by getting diseases\\\".  Why I did say is that free moral : choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject : God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not : expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic : universe.  I am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone. I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.  What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?    : Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).

This is why we recommend these books.  Is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence for this? If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al) suggest, why do people still insist on this?   : Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.

Claiming that that truth is absolute, though, seems  to imply a literal reading of the Bible.  If it were absolute truth  (constant across time, culture, etc.) then no interpretation would be  necessary.  It may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different  from person to person.  To me, that doesn't mean that one person is  right and the other is wrong.  I believe that God transcends our simple  minds, and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly  this intent.  God knows me, and knows that my needs are different  from yours or anyone else's.  By claiming that scripture is absolute, then at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong. I just don't believe that God is that rigid.   This is where the arrogance comes in to play.  Since these principles  are crystal clear to evangelicals, maybe the rest of us should just take their word for it?  Maybe it isn't at all crystal clear to *me* that  their fundamental principles are either fundamental *or* principles.

Maybe to a certain  segment of Christianity, but to all.   Not at all.  I think it supports my position much more effectively  than yours.  :-)  So, I think that your position is: The Bible is absolute truth, but as we are prone to error in our  interpretation, we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out  what that truth is. Did I get that right?  What's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending  absolute truth, when we can never know what those truths are, and we  can never (or at least shouldn't) act upon them?

It was quite a while ago. \",\"[..] Referring to the manual of my motherboard with AMI-BIOS, 10 beeps are a  'CMOS Shutdown Register Read/Write Error', if the system stops after these beeps. If the system continues, it is a 'Keyboard error'.  Michael\",\"    Syria had been bombing Israeli settlements from the Golan and sending terrorist squads into Israel for years.  Do you need me to provide specifics? I can.  Why don't you give it up, Hasan?  I'm really starting to get tired of your  empty lies.  You can defend your position and ideology with documented facts and arguments rather than the crap you regularly post.  Take an example from someone like Brendan McKay, with whom I don't agree, but who uses logic and documentation to argue his position.  Why must you insist on constantly spouting baseless lies?  You may piss some people off, but that's about it.  You won't prove anything or add anything worthy to a discussion.  Your arguments just  prove what a poor debater you are and how weak your case really is.\",\"It was a gift from God.  I think basically the reasoning was that the tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus. As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.) Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition because she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.  Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She  refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old  would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.  RCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, that being Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.  In this case, mostly
