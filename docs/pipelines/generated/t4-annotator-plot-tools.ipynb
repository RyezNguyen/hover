Here's some information about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have some money available...  John Spencer, 1993/04/21  Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21, (21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;       1993 May 1-2          A-ring ingress  18:27                egress   19:30         B-ring ingress  19:51                egress   21:42         C-ring egress   23:00         Saturn ingress  23:59                egress   10:02         B-ring ingress  10:28                egress   12:19         A-ring ingress  12:40                egress   13:43       1993 July 20-21          Saturn ingress  21:16                egress   05:08         A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)                egress   09:38  Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris, and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus' orbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from Iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my attention.  THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?     To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July   disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,   etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,   except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3   airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with   a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something   to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.    Jay  and again:    please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet   disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would   be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and   getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a   good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't   think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are   well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One   possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.  jay\",\"  Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by sentence.   1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.  Origins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?  2) Science cannot explain origins.  This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends on what origins we are talking about.  3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science.  Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \\\"higher truth\\\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \\\"higher\\\" or  \\\"lower\\\"; they are simply true.  More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the scope of discussion.  4) This is a false premise.  If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.  5) By the way, I enjoy science.  On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read. However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy, perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.  6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.  Let us not quibble; count this one as true.  7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]  Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification:  \\\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\\\"  -----  It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.\",\" [Prof. Denning's description of SkipJack mostly omitted]   CHIP STRUCTURE  The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption  algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared  with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16  for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is  16 Mbits a second. [...]   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips  N, a 30-bit serial number  U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted    with the chip  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then  fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:        E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and      E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    Three questions: 1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output:   E[M;K] = 64 bits   E[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits   E[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits    Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,    or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?       All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications    like cellular phones (or even regular phones over   2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?    Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,    or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only    transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into    everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?  3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself?    Does the block have to be present at all?    Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,    it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's     limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,    and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness    (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets    it recognize a valid E[K;U].)        In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT    wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?    (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.)    Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;    paranoid people can use someone else's serial number.     On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,    presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,    like use message encryption that's really E[M; K,U,N] ?

Thanks, Jason\",\"  All your article reflects is your abundant ignorance. The people of  Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never  abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally  hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole  perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July  15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop  Makarios.  Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with  the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right  given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently  and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For  those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island  since 1571.   The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct.               THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM  2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus  It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum.  AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS  The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed...  The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.  Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event.  \\\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying, in  Greek, \\\"You want Taksim eh!\\\"  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.  When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered.  In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying \\\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\\\"  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed.  An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded.  We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.  There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter.  After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport.  All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me.\\\"  ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER  We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days.  We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights.  In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner.  In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother.  In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head.  This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.  Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

Right now we  are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages. Thousands of people  abandoning homes, land, herds; Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless. This   time, the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the bust of Plato do not suffice to   cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors.   Article by Giorgo Bocca, Correspondent of Il Giorno  Date: 14 January 1964   DAILY HERALD (London)   AN APPALLING SIGHT  And when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight. Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.  In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16  wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.    DAILY TELEGRAPH (London)    GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE   Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the  Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found  crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were  brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three   more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could  not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to   locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.   Serdar Argic\",\"Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part03 Last-modified: 1993/4/15   FAQ for sci.crypt, part 3: Basic Cryptology  This is the third of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.    Contents:  * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key? * What references can I start with to learn cryptology? * How does one go about cryptanalysis? * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance? * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem? * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice? * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?   * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?    The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted   acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A   by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone   who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.    A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so   that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is   the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art   of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when   you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both   cryptography and cryptanalysis.    The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is   called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert   plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert   ciphertext into plaintext.    A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The   algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,   Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different   values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.    The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are   called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,   eavesdroppers, or third parties.  * What references can I start with to learn cryptology?    For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given   in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,   concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,   these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has   developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and   mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is   encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up   to the mid-60's.    Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or   Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want   to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common   mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.    The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of   many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently   several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The   book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range   of security including encryption algorithms, database security,   access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments   apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].    The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite   technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in   the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of   DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses   of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on   modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management   and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and   networks.    The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on   the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.  * How does one go about cryptanalysis?    Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of   analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern   finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available   textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series   [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for   the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given   systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the   cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still   classified.    Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,   or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare   of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the   most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.  * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?    In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can   find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.    Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding   ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the   plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or   decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.   Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this   brute-force search is impractical.        Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered   practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years   now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with   this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the   mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic   decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel   machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.   Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].    One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a   brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.  * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?    The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key   rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.    A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The   unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of   ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and   if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount   of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is   probably strong.    A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears   random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).        A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A   system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.    If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily   strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.   However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is   strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then   he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring   integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.  * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?    Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical   cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your   ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might   assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is   correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the   rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same   plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus   he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he   doesn't have a chance.    Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,   for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even   chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into   the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See   [KAH67].    * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?\",\"  As I remember it, the name of the program your looking for is called icofrite.

Client Software: SunOs 4.1.1, X11R5 Server Hardware: Sun IPC Server Software: SunOs 4.1.1, Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37)  A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers (including MIT X11R5 Xsun, DecWindows, Tektronix X terminal) has no problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users.  I have tried the following things:      1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch        (100444-37).      2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.      3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110).        This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of        menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method), and        screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help, but I        was still able to get the application to hang.  Repeat By:  This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times.  Click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up)  Click and release on a menu item  Repeat until application hangs   Any help would be appreciated.

Why is your criticism ALWAYS directed against Israel, but never against the Arab states, even when they are so much more guilty of the accusations you make?  Is it because you now call yourself a Palestinean?    This is why the \\\"land-for-peace\\\" formula is so foolish.  Land-for-land or peace-for-peace seems much more just, except that it would cost the Arabs something and so is not under consideration.    Let's not forget that about half of Israel's population are refugees from Arab countries.  Somehow, THEIR land now being occupied by Arab states and THEIR homes now being lived-in by Arab people are not included in any negotiations.  Is this your prescription for peace?    Again, you've somehow managed to overlook the fact that the Arab states are much more restrictive on these points.  In fact, the officially Judenrein policies of almost all of the Arab states makes them resemble Nazi Germany chillingly closely.   There are many states in which Christians can live happily, many which have official religions and Christian majorities and Christian-based laws.  There are some 2 dozen Arab and Islamic states.  There is only 1 (one) Jewish state.  Do you have a problem with this?  Is this one Jewish state too many?  There are others who might agree with you, you know.    Have you just arrived on tpm recently???  Again, the supporters of the Arab and Islamic camps are frequently and massively guilty of \\\"emotional, infantile outbursts\\\" which have weakened their positions dramatically.

In addition, the PEXt toolkit by Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com) is  available on export as PEXt.tar.Z; it includes a PEX widget making it easier to include PEX in Xt-based programs.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  86)  Where can I get an X-based TeX or DVI previewer?   The xtex previewer for TeX files is available from a number of archive  sites, including uunet; the current version is usually on ftp.cs.colorado.edu (128.138.204.31) in SeeTeX-2.18.5.tar.Z; pre-converted fonts are also on that  machine. The distribution all includes \\\"mftobdf\\\" which converts PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format, where they can then be compiled for use by your local X server.   The xdvi dvi-previewer is fairly comprehensive and easy to use. It is  also available from a number of sites, including uunet and export.lcs.mit.edu; current version is patchlevel 16 [12/92].  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  87)  Where can I get an X-based troff previewer?   X11R4 has two previewers for device-independent troff: the supported  client xditview, and the contributed-but-well-maintained xtroff. An earlier  version of xtroff also appeared on the R3 contributed source. xditview is also in the R5 distribution.  In addition, the xman client can be used to preview troff documents which use the -man macros (i.e. man pages).  If psroff is used its output can be viewed with a PostScript previewer.  In addition:   xproof, an X previewer for ditroff has been contributed by Marvin  Solomon (solomon@cs.wisc.edu); version 3.5 is available on export in  contrib/xproof*.  [8/90]   Elan Computer Group (CA: 415-964-2200) produces eroff, a modified  troff implementation, and Elan/Express, an X11 eroff previewer.   SoftQuad (416-963-8337; USA only 800-387-2777, mail@sq.uu.net or mail@sq.com) offers SoftQuad Publishing Software, including a substantially- rewritten troff formatter, a better intermediate language with backwards  compatibility, and an X11[R3,R4] previewer.

A new release of the DIRT interface builder by Richard Hesketh works  with X11R5 and includes some support for the Motif widget set. From the README:   This builder allows the interactive creation and rapid prototyping of X user   interfaces using the X Toolkit and a number of Widget Sets.  Dirt generates   \\\"Wc - Widget Creation\\\" resource files and this distribution also includes the   Widget Creation Library (version 1.06, with the exception of the demos and   Mri/Ari source code) with the kind permission of its author David E. Smyth. Check dirt.README, dirt.A2.0.tar.Z, and dirt.PS.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.   The InterViews 3.0.1 C++ toolkit contains a WYSIWIG interface builder  called ibuild. ibuild generates code for an InterViews application complete  with Imakefile and an X-resource file. Documentation is /pub/papers/ibuild.ps  on interviews.stanford.edu (36.22.0.175).  Quest Windows's (408-496-1900) ObjectViews C++ package includes an interactive building tool.    Druid (Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development) runs on SPARC  machines using OSF/Motif 1.0; it is intended eventually to be a full UIMS but  apparently now has only support for creating the presentation components, for  which it generates C/UIL code.

In addition, Neuron Data (1 415 321-4488) makes Open Interface, a  window-system-independent object toolkit which supports interfaces which are  or resemble (supersets of) Mac, Windows, and Motif and Open Look; the package  includes an interface builder.         In addition, the GRAMMI builder supports the development of Ada/X  applications using its own set of objects which are planned to have a Motif  look.  GRAMMI is written in Ada and generates Ada specs and stub bodies.  (1-800-GRAMMI-1).   In addition, these non-WYSIWYG but related products may help for goals  of rapid prototyping of the application interface:   WCL: the Widget Creation Library. Basically describes the widget hierarchy and actions in a resources file; available from fine archive servers everywhere, including devvax.jpl.nasa.gov (128.149.1.143) in pub/. Wcl provides a very thin layer over Xt without any internal tweaking. Version 2.5 is current [3/93].  WINTERP: an Xlisp-based Motif toolkit allows for interpretive  programming. The copy on the R4 tape is outdated; get a copy off export or  email to winterp-source%hplnpm@hplabs.hp.com.   The Serpent UIMS permits the building of user-interfaces without  specific knowledge of coding but with an understanding of attributes being set on a particular [Motif] widget.  Beta Release 1.2 is available from  ftp.sei.cmu.edu (128.237.1.13) and can be found in /pub/serpent.  Serpent is  also available on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.11) in /contrib/serpent.

I want to have a shell script pop up menus and yes/no dialog boxes if the user  is running X.   Several tools in the R3 contrib/ area were developed to satisfy these needs: yorn pops up a yes/no box, xmessage displays a string, etc. There are several versions of these tools; few, if any, have made it to the R4 contrib/  area, though they may still be available on various archive sites.  In addition, Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has posted the xmenu package to comp.sources.x (\\\"v08i008: xmenu\\\") for 1-of-n choices.  [7/90]  Two versions of XPrompt have been posted to comp.sources.x, the latter being an unauthorized rewrite. [R. Forsman (thoth@reef.cis.ufl.edu), 1/91]  There is a version of XMenu available from comp.sources.x; it is being worked on and will likely be re-released.  xp-1.1.tar.Z, xpick-1.0.tar.Z and xzap-1.0.tar.Z on export's contrib/ are tools by Gerry.Tomlinson@newcastle.ac.UK which act as X versions of the  simple display and choice-making tools in K&P. [4/92]  xtpanel lets the user build a panel containing interactive objects such as buttons, sliders, text fields, etc., either from the command line or using a simple scripting language. It is available for anonymous ftp from  hanauma.Stanford.EDU (36.51.0.16) as pub/X/xtpanel.tar.Z and may also be found  in the alt.sources archives.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  90)  Where can I get an X-based debugger?   xdbx, an X interface to the dbx debugger, is available via ftp from  export. The current [1/91] version is 2.1 patchlevel 2.  An X interface to gdb called xxgdb is more like xdbx 2.1.2. It is part  of comp.sources.x volume 11 [2/91]; xxgdb-1.06.tar.Z is on export.  mxgdb is a Motif interface to gdb by Jim Tsillas  (jtsillas@bubba.ma30.bull.com); version 1.1.5 was released 1/93.  UPS is a source-level debugger which runs under the X11 and SunView window systems on Sun and DEC platforms. It is available from export  (18.24.0.11) as contrib/ups-2.45.tar.Z (also ups-2.45-to-2.45.2.patch.Z) and unix.hensa.ac.uk (129.12.21.7) in /pub/misc/unix/ups (or try mail to  archive@unix.hensa.ac.uk).

How can I \\\"tee\\\" an X program identically to several displays?   There are several protocol multiplexer tools which provide for the  simultaneous display of X clients on any number of machines.  XMX (an X Protocol Multiplexor) is available from wilma.cs.brown.edu  (128.148.33.66) as pub/xmx.tar.Z It works independently of the server and does not affect the application being shared; it was developed for use in the electronic classroom.  XTV is a conference program which can be used to duplicate the \\\"chalkboard\\\" on several displays. Release 1 is available on the X11R5 contrib tapes; a more recent version is on ftp.cs.odu.edu as pub/wahab/XTV.r2.tar.Z.  SHX from Michael Altenhofen of Digital Equipment GmbH CEC Karlsruhe  also does this; it is a \\\"WYSIWIS\\\" (What You See Is What I See) package in the  context of a computer-based learning/training tool to provide online help from remote tutors but is also useful for general window sharing.

This FAQ includes information on a number of \\\"gotchas\\\" that can bite  you on particular system. However, the best source of general information on  building the X11 release is found in the Release Notes. The file is bundled  separately from the rest of the release, so if it's become separated from your  sources you can FTP another copy separately: the file RELNOTES.[ms,PS,TXT] at  the top of the distribution.

In addition, O'Reilly & Associates's Volume 8 on X Administration includes information on configuring and building X.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  94)  Why doesn't my Sun with a cg6 work with R5?   Apparently gcc is the problem; it seems to produce fine code for all Sun displays except for the cgsix.

If you get errors with _dlsym _dlopen _dlclose undefined, link with  libdl.a.  Add \\\"-ldl\\\" to your and eventually your site.def.  You may want to  surround it with \\\"-Bstatic -ldl -Bdynamic\\\" if you add it to the EXTRA_LIBRARIES variable, since \\\"syslibs\\\" get added after EXTRA_LIBRARIES on the eventual  compilation command; otherwise you may not have a shared libdl.  (Or compile  the stubs shared.)  [thanks to Joe Backo (joe.backo@East.Sun.COM), 12/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  96)  What is this strange problem building X clients on SunOS 4.1.2?   In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts with the way X11R4 builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols to be undefined when building some X11 clients:   _get_wmShellWidgetClass  _get_applicationShellWidgetClass Compiling \\\"-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic\\\" appears to work.   To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please  contact your local Sun office and request the following patches:  Patch i.d.

The patch is on export in [1/93]  contrib/X11R4_sunos4.1.2_patch_version3.Z  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  97)  Why can't gcc compile X11R4 on my SPARC? I used gcc to compile the whole distribution, but I get several segmentation faults when running X.   Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the 680x0 or VAX platforms.   Here is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing  structures as arguments and returning them as function values, so when  gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or  return structs, run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and  the server.   This is from the GCC manual:   On the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for   structures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument  list, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by   reference.   This really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet  supported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.   The convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and  `-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.  You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with  compilation flags.     Files which need to be compiled using cc include:   server/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c    rgb/rgb.c   In addition, several of the \\\"inet_\\\" functions use structs as args or return values:     clients/xhost/xhost.c    clients/xauth/gethost.c.  Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly  harmless as they don't involve structs.  [collected by bashford@scripps.edu (Don Bashford); 8/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  98)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc? When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error   \\\"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket.   Fatal server bug! no screens found.\\\"   Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do  this simple test:   #include <sys/ioctl.h>  SIOCGIFCONF  Run that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of  interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like  whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your  fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc sources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are  identical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make  sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.    [courtesy der Mouse, mouse@LARRY.MCRCIM.MCGILL.EDU; 9/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  99)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 on the older Sun3? In mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found \\\"missing\\\" defines for  CG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be?   The R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add these lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:         #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)         #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN         #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN         #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN   However, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so  references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the  Imakefile.  [11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 100)  What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS 4.1.1? The file <sundev/cg6reg.h> isn't being found.   Sun omitted <sundev/cg6reg.h> from SunOS 4.1.1. Remove the #include  from sunCG6C.c and replace it with the line   #define CG6_VADDR_COLOR   0x70016000 The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied  from another distribution.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 101)  What are these problems using R4 shared libraries on SunOS 4? All of the executables that I try to run have the following results:  ld.so: libXmu.so.4: not found or even:  ld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96c   If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun, remember that you  need to run \\\"ldconfig\\\" as root after installing the shared libraries (if you've installed X on a file-server, run it on the server's clients, too).  While  building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid  linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those  distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have  LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.   If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that  the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or  /usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked  statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]  Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it attempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed. You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to most C compilers).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)  This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in  X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was  removed in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5 libraries only applied to the documented interface).    A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4 or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.  [10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis  (jpf@heliocentric.com)]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?   There is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload) running under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using  shared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:  1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used by these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security  problems at your site.  2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).  3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths to the libraries.  [from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]  The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this  may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks.

On many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits  anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by  accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps more annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console  display.

Imake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is a makefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro- processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles  suitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not  specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the  configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.  Imake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by which the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration files, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not  obvious.  There have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and R5 versions are different.   You can obtain information on imake from these sources:  - the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on using Imake to build X  - the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information  - on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4 guide to imake.  - the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim Fulton on an early version of Imake  - Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful  explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non- supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu in the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and  config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby.  [7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email; mail a message body of \\\"send imake-stuff help\\\" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.  - see \\\"System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?\\\" by Dinah McNutt in the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.  - German readers should expect in June 1992 an article \\\"Das Meta-Make  / I make, you make / Schwerelos\\\" by Rainer Klute in \\\"iX  Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin\\\", directed at application programmers needing to write Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The X Journal, issue 2:1.  - The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on demystifying Imake.  - Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in  sasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.  [1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 107)  Where can I get imake?   Versions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier  version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits  redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the  template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such  configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the  templates distributed with X11R5.  export contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire distribution.  A stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in ftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?   If you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run \\\"xmkmf\\\". This is a  script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a  Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make,  which will use that new Makefile to compile the program.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines? When I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:  Undefined:  _XShapeQueryExtension  _XShapeCombineMask   These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE) which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular windows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will  only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many  vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case  they will display rectangular windows anyway.   In order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library  libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes will be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do  not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be  compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X  libraries.

Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 110)  What are these problems with \\\"_XtInherit not found\\\" on the Sun? When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the  error \\\"ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit\\\".   What you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to  get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that  is both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting  _XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby  guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where  XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally be called.   You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal Xt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere.   1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a  connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called XtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your  program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.  2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView  program. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command.    It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically, although this will certainly solve the problem.

I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under  the current version of X, I get this message:  Undefined:  _XtScrollBarSetThumb  _XtTextSetInsertionPoint  _XtTextReplace   There were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition to the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4 release notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but are part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*. [10/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?   The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the window manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are called \\\"hints\\\" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you can use something like the following:          XWMHints wmhints;         ...         wmhints.flags = InputHint;         wmhints.input = True;         XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)  If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput  resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have source, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.  Certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having  this done.    If you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.  OpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true  [mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?   You can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case.   For most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so  long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in  which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can  sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may  be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order to give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window  manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing; this surely leads to future compatibility problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?    There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the  Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development  under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional  development. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive  application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to \\\"test just  this one little thing\\\" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that  puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4  distributions, and the Xlib \\\"Hello World\\\" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and  R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4  Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x   by Glenn Widener of Tektronix.  [3/90]   In addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute  showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display  connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?   The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:  {  Arg args[3];  int i;  int sensitive;  /* oops; wrong data type */  i=0;  XtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;  XtGetValues(widget, args, i );  ...  }  But XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte;  declaring the variable \\\"sensitive\\\" as Boolean works properly. This problem  comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types  Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar  problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page. [11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?   You're probably trying to use these functions from application code. They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a  parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising  functions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use  only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.  The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources. Although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the  widgets' data becoming corrupted.  [The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be  avoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?   Although there are various details of the current implementation of the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the \\\"new\\\" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves? What should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics are defined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old  widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired  resources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in  creating a new widget.   Note that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B.

If you are going to make use of this dubious analogy, at least make it accurate.  And by the way, in Texas you can drive a car in public (with the proper credentials), but an ordinary civilian can't carry a gun legally in public to save his/her life.  So I won't even consider registration, *manadatory* safety classes, or *manadatory* liability insurance unless I get a federal law repealing all local, state, and federal gun control laws which abridge the Second Amendment, and a non-discretionary federal weapons carry permit, good anywhere in the United States.  Come on, you wanted the analogy.   Mike Ruff\",\"I finally got it back, with great thanks to Mark Spiegel for saving and sending it.    #2 ROB ZETTLER  Season: 4th Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  C/C-  Zettler gave the Sharks every bit he's got this year; unfortunately, this still wasn't enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer, if that.  He works hard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an offensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #3 DAVID WILLIAMS  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, free agent from New Jersey Grade:  C/C-  IMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92, playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and good defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City, was good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that '91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he was prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last year.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #4 JAYSON MORE  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft Grade:  B+  After being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp before '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not particularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then, proceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most reliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash. Offensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73 games), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.  #5 NEIL WILKINSON  Season: 4th Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B-  Wilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However, partially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25 games total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed even when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners; that is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if he can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.  #6 SANDIS OZOLINSH  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft Grade:  I (A)  At the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers), Ozolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury in that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games), but he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points), which, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from their defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still susceptible to so-called \\\"rookie mistakes,\\\" but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back from his injuries, he is ready to be a star.  #19 DOUG ZMOLEK  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B  Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks to play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but after being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points). He was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the team; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to become a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and defensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.\",\" I've gotten migraines after exercise, though for me it seems to be related to exercising without having eaten recently.  \",\"L(>  |JB>  1) Ron...what do YOU consider to be \\\"proper channels\\\"...

Arab governments generally don't care much about the Palestineans and their struggle but find it useful for political purposes back home. They are happy to leave the Palestineans largely under Israeli control because that leaves the job of controlling them to the Israelis.  The Israelis don't like this job any more than King Hussein of Jordan liked it -- and he managed to kill them off at the rate of thousands per month when they started an Intifada in Jordan.  The governments of Syria, Lebanon and Egypt all feel similarly.  However, proclaiming public support for the Palestinean war against Israel deflects criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to even the most brutal Arab tyrants.  Arab *PEOPLE* probably aren't much more sympathetic.  Palestineans have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in Jordan, Lebanon and Kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere.  You might still be right in sympathy to the war against Israel, but I suspect that many Arabs, far removed from the immediate border with Israel (e.g. in Kuwait or Morroco), couldn't care less. \",\"As the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of   late.

Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application   that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I   need to re-boot.  Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I   first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many   GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows   (with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge   machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into   the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into   the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I   was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother   board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from   SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized   fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.  The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes   rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves   the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't.   I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said   these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire   day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's   in the sppace of 20 minutes?  What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good   diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software   problem (ie EMM386 etc.)?

X  X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST: X  X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X        * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X  X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that mearly works X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language. X    (see \\\"The New Hacker's Dictionary\\\" by Eric Raymond) X  X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical  X    closing date for contests are in early May. X  X    The contest rules are posted to comp.unix.wizards, comp.lang.c, X    misc.misc, alt.sources and comp.sources.d.  If you do not have access  X    to these groups, or if you missed the early March posting, you may  X    request a copy from the judges, via Email, at; X  X        judges@toad.com   -or-   ...!{sun,uunet,utzoo,pyramid}!hoptoad!judges X  X    Previous contest winners are available via anonymous ftp from X    ftp.uu.net under the directory /pub/ioccc.

Your acceleartion times also vary, magazine to magazine Road & Track and Car& Driver have the GS-R at 6.8 to 8.0 for Road and Track. Also Quarter mile times vary from 15.4 to 16.1 You can't tell exactly by the numbers.  Furthermore, the Integra will definately outrun the Beretta on the high end.

I'm not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when you comparing it to a Acura Engine.

I then used kermit to transmit them via modem to my host computer, a PC-based file system.  I access internet through modem access to a university mainframe.  From the PC file server, I pull the files to a disk, and then pull them from disk to a SGI Indigo (the SGI is not networked yet).  When I try to uncompress and un-tar the files, they either come out as garbage or I get an error in the tar process about directories being invalid.

If I only had to solve the problem for myself, and were willing to have to type in a second password (the secret key) whenever I logged in, it could work. However, I'm trying to create a solution that anyone can use, and which, once installed, is just as effortless to start up as the non-solution of just using xhost(1) to control access. I've got religeous problems with storing secret keys on multiuser computers.   Thanks for the pointer! It was good reading, and I liked the idea of using several unrelated sources with a strong mixing function. However, unless I missed something, the only source they suggested (aside from a hardware RNG) that seems available, and unguessable by an intruder, when a Unix is fresh-booted, is I/O buffers related to network traffic. I believe my solution basically uses that strategy, without requiring me to reach into the kernel.   I heard about this solution, and it sounded good. Then I heard that folks were experiencing times of 30-60 seconds to run this, on reasonably-configured workstations. I'm not willing to add that much delay to someone's login process. My approach (etherfind|compress, skip 10K) takes a second or two to run. I'm considering writing the be-all and end-all of solutions, that launches the MD5, and simultaneously tries to suck bits off the net, and if the net should be sitting __SO__ idle that it can't get 10K after compression before MD5 finishes, use the MD5. This way I could have guaranteed good bits, and a deterministic upper bound on login time, and still have the common case of login take only a couple of extra seconds.\",\"  But you haven't taken into the account of propoganda.  Remember, if you asked Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughtered, they would probably answer no, but, after the propoganda machine rolled through, at least some were able to tolerate it.  You see, it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general frenzy.   Well, they haven't managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity of the courts.  But, they have managed to create quite a few problems for people that wanted to have an abortion.  They could create similar problems for us.  And, it could be worse.  They can try to stop abortions by blocking clinics, etc., but imagine what they'd have to do to stop atheism.   So, you are able to convince them individually, but could you convince a whole room of them?  A whole nation?   Yes, I'd be glad if it were gone to.  I've never supported it.  However, I think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored, contrasted with what *could* happen (an what may be likely).   Well, I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key (the motto can be attributed to him), but it is at least clear that he believed in a god.  And, surely there are a few Christians that think as you say, but I don't think that most do.  Do you think that all Christians actively despise other religions?  Most that I have met haven't and don't do so.   Well, I have asked a Hindu, Moselem, and a few Jews, and all of them think that it is applicable to them.  Of course, I can't say that these people (just some that I know pretty well) are accurate representations of their faiths.   Well, I'd really like to, and I've tried, but I really don't know where to get access to _Congressional Records_ from the 1950's.  Can anyone help out here?   Only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs.    So, are you saying that they redesign the plates each year?  Anyway, your whole argument (conveniently deleted I see) was that the motto somehow costs us all a lot of money.  This is just not correct.   That is to say, the religion of this country, and the non-religion of the USSR.  That was what most of those quotes were about, and some included all atheists, in general, as well.  I don't think that any of the quotes (although I seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about Jesus. They advocated religion over non-religion.  A specific religion was not mentioned.   So, you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions should be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong?  That's silly. I think the Flat-Earthers are wrong, but I don't advocate their banishment.   I think that any such cost would be insignificant.  I mentioned the slight cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by being on our currency.   Well, mottos in general don't really have purposes...  I don't think it should be removed because I think the benefit would be outweighed by the consequences.   Then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress.   Why not?  It is the majority that put it there.   But do they remember the debate surrounding the motto?  Do they remember that some people intended it to be a message against atheists?  Why don't you include this in your little survey that you were conducting?  [...]  What?  Should I ask some scientists the probability that something Einstein said about relativity is worthy?  I mean, if Einstein said it, there's a good chance that it was right (at least at the time).   You need not agree with them all of the time, but you would certainly think that their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point.   No, I think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a Supreme Court Justice to testify before Congress during the consideration of a Constitutional Amendment.

SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides  SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers. SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit},  and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}.  The article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses TEN (10) devices in it native mode, outside its native mode it behaves a lot like SCSI-1 (7 devices, slower through put}  From your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out as for \\\"20% faster then IDE\\\" that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2  contoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1 and gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1, far in excess of a normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near the burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip.  The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2  controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device {As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the \\\"20% faster then IDE\\\" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 controller chip. SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips {becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit mode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips {or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware (port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO creates a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes.\",\" My own personal and highly subjective opinion is that freedom is a good thing.

Will the higher : resolution be noticed for these? :  If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript. I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript. It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation processed PS.  The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.  We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's demo though).

I hope you're not a student at Duke... you would be wasting your tuition. \",\"  Just want to back this up with a personal anecdote.  My grandparents have a Navajo rug made in the 1920's, which they received in trade  from the weaver while living in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The decorative motif consists of 4 large black swastikas, one in each corner.  What's more, the color scheme is black, white, and red.  To the casual glance it would undoubtedly appear to be a Nazi relic of some kind.  Yet they owned it ten years before Hitler and the National Socialists came to power.    As I recall, they took it down in the 30's, and didn't feel quite right about putting it back up until the 60's.  It still draws comments from  those who don't know what it is.  --ccm  --  Christopher C. May * U. of Ariz.

Since when?  #   which concludes that by being homosexual, you will molest children or that #   by being homosexual you will have the propensity for molesting children.  I haven't said that \\\"homosexual = child molester,\\\" simply that is more likely.  #   If 26% of the molestations are by homosexuals, why are you so concerned #   about creating a relation between the two?

You know damn well what's going to happen.  Some guy in a NAMBLA T-shirt's going to apply at a day-care, they're going to turn him down, he's going to take it to court, and the court's going to rule that sexual orientation is defined as homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality.  Unless and until that court decides that pedophilia is a sexual orientation, you have no business saying so.   Despite the fact that all homosexuals are lying bastards?   Ah.

Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple (early March).  Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is it because too many people take French and German in college to make the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance. Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.   For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.  Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.   Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care.  At that point, they wouldn't even consider a \\\"voucher\\\" approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.   It is \\\"free\\\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda.  The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer  1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For  1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance. Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.   Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.  When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's public health insurance plan.  gld\",\"--  Thanks to all of you who gave advice on the CB900 Custom.   As recommended, I had the bike compression tested.  Compression was a little low, but very even across the four cylinders (+/- 5 psi).  They said that it was tested a little cold, so that would explain the low  numbers (around 90).  Does this sound right?  Otherwise, the bike looked great.  No signs of road rash, and no rust.  This bike looks great!  It is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.   I am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those  who posted this other thread).

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan- ger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the  physical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had  an awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas ornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this  went on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and  was in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into tears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .  Then someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I  want to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am  silent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling me, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the one whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place,  telling him, \\\"I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring  her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse.\\\" He went and returned empty handed, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his  apartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were  walking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls.  There was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.  They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I  went down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the apartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be  cowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the  doors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth,  opened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle  Sabir's son started to shout, \\\"Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!\\\" He  knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma.  Aunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their  apartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying delirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother. All of my family had gathered there.     At the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the apartment.  Later I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, \\\"Lyuda,  Karina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes  you, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful.\\\" It was as though her whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one  side, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her  cheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole microdistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, \\\"Fine.\\\" Mamma was  afraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started  to cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the bed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye  that was intact, looked at me, and said, \\\"Who is it?\\\" But I could barely talk,  my whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered something tender, something incomprehensible, but tender, \\\"My Karochka, my Karina, my  little golden one . . . \\\" She understood me.  Then Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips.  She started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't  understand it. Then I made out, \\\"It hurts, I hurt all over.\\\" Her hair was  glued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her  forehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how  to help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She's saying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil  and paper and says, \\\"Write it down.\\\" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I  can't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me  something, but she couldn't. I say, \\\"Karina, just lie there a little while, then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then.\\\" And then she says, \\\"Maybe it'll be too late.\\\" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn't control myself.  Then I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She  says, \\\"Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this  damned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We need to call Urshan.\\\" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I  understood her every word. I ask, \\\"What's his number?\\\" Urshan Feyruzovich,  that's the head of the administration where she works. \\\"We have to call him.\\\"  But I didn't know his home number. I say, \\\"Karina, what's his number?\\\" She  says, \\\"I can't remember.\\\" I say, \\\"Who knows his number? Who can I call?\\\" She  says, \\\"I don't know anything, leave me alone.\\\"  I went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was  crying, too. I say, \\\"Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can  we call him? Who knows his telephone number?\\\" I tell Marina, \\\"Think, think,  who can we call to find out?\\\" She started calling; several people didn't  answer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and  found out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he  was at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says,  \\\"Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and  tell them that they just can't do that.\\\" She still didn't know what was really going on. I said, \\\"It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's  happening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single  Armenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised  that we managed to save ourselves. \\\"She says, \\\"Well, OK, if it's that serious  . . . \\\" And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up  and that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. \\\"OK,  fine, fine,\\\" she says, \\\"if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back  I'll send him over.\\\"  We called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly  under Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She  wasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed  everything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on trying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and  finally we get through. She says, \\\"Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your  place now.\\\" He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either,  because he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep  with his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what  shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has  grown up daughters, they're almost my age.  The three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and went down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No,  first they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As soon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said that we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have fractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the first floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around eleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I  saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies . . . everything just like a war.  They carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical people from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older  Armenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud  she would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle  Arkady, I think, because someone said \\\"Arkady, get an injection ready,\\\" he  started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But  when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his  sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and  started to cry: \\\"What have they done to you?!\\\" He was speaking Armenian. \\\"What have they done to you?!\\\" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and  she started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \\\"I'll give you a shot.\\\"  Mamma tells him, \\\"I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what  are they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people, and you're just sitting here!\\\" Some teacups were standing on the table in  there. \\\"You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my  daughters! Look what they've turned them into!\\\" They gave her something to  drink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the doctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa  and Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina  out. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I  don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: \\\"What's  the matter with you?\\\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter in the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's. I said, \\\"I'm fine.\\\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told  the doctor, \\\"You leave, let a woman examine her.\\\" A woman came, an  Azerbaijani, I believe, and said, \\\"What's wrong with you?\\\" I was wearing my  sister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When  she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would  be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed her. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge  wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said  something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be  dressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.  They put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me.  I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't  know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \\\"Lie still, you mustn't move.\\\" When I was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed  very familiar to me. I shouted, \\\"Stop!\\\" One of the policemen turned and says,  \\\"What do you want?\\\" I say, \\\"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\\\" They  brought him over and I said, \\\"That person was just in our apartment and he  just raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\\\" They said,  \\\"Fine,\\\" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were  taking him.  Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were  sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car  up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \\\"Sister . . . \\\" I don't  remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they did to us. I asked him, \\\"Where are you from?\\\" He said that he was from Ufa.  Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I  learned that they suffered most of all. He says, \\\"OK, you're Armenians, they  didn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,\\\" he says, \\\"what are they trying  to kill me for?\\\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the  balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw  two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed  against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him with his own club. The way he cried \\\"Mamma\\\" made my skin crawl. I don't know  what they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before  he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the third or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was  Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they were throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with  someone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the  yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that I realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.  They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too  and said, \\\"I've been beaten too, help me.\\\" But they just ignored her. My  father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault  that he'd been beaten, and says, \\\"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have  probably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\\\" The doctor says, \\\"That's not my job.\\\" Urshan said, \\\"Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor,  I'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them  to his apartment.  Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the  doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I  wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very surprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the Hippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy-- coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she, having examined Karina, said, \\\"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like  they did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women. \\\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she would certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same  story. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no  drugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon found out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And they started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at  zoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from  seeing it.  They put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have  any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their  place, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira  her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And Ira was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed. When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she  involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again. Her daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful  when I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \\\"Do what you want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\\\" Well, they did what they  wanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I  would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It  was simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do  every day: steal, kill, rape . . .  Many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts  explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those  children would be grown, and then, as they put it, \\\"we'll come take the  pleasure out of their lives, those children.\\\" This was about the girls that would be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow  because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just as there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be  of some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the  victims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they themselves said that.  And this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many  people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know  why their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before,  maybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and  they weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at  nothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with  Marina: \\\"Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over  there [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman  shouldn't see such things.\\\" So they were really quite sober . . .  So we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all  happened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several  hours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what happened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk- ing to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he thought no one is listening: \\\"Listen,\\\" he'll say, \\\"what could I do? What could I do alone, how could I protect them?\\\" I don't know where to find the words, it's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen.  That's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of  course he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail of what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke together in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never present at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And when the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.  On February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital. First they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city,  the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier.  There were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family  there. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They  were sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife  and Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.  Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard. There's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area. They took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide. The women were shouting. They explained to them: \\\"We want to hide you better because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\\\"  We went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We had children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to  have their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful.  They kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you  could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the  police precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is  surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were  standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought  great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't  just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48, or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost  family members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened  when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single person, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must have already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret  room down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at one another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those  people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that the end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the  hospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my  parents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should  attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an  Armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and  she wouldn't be able to take it.  Then soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people  climbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers. They all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We  calmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some  little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children to the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never  have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people  do eat.  Then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They  were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from  the courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a  different woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing,  and calling out: \\\"Oh, Rafik!,\\\" but when she heard about this such a rage came  over her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her  sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were  soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash  him! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not  one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from  doing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands,  muttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile appeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round was over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing  terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the  creeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did  this the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She  went five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women,  \\\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they  raped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though  nothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?\\\" She appealed to everyone, but no  one got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I  could barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so  many hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already after ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the  elderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time.  There was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking.  The situation was deplorable.  At eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen,  Azerbaijanis. They said, \\\"Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up and put the children to bed.\\\" Now the women didn't want to leave this place,  either. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with  dogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \\\"Oh, it's our little  family,\\\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for  the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone spoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded machine guns in their hands, said, \\\"Grandmother, you mustn't approach me, I'm on guard.\\\" Our people would say, \\\"Oh, that's all right.\\\" They hugged them, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly moving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.  They took us up to the second floor and said, \\\"You can undress and sleep in  here. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city.\\\" This was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other places. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the SK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I  asked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me. I didn't know what was happening there. They told me, \\\"Don't worry, the Maternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest assured. I say, \\\"Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in there is capable of anything.\\\"  When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had already been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi- tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once we were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met  acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who  hadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with  them, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had  come their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like  they had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people,  hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of  course the stories and the talk were flying: \\\"Oh, I heard that they killed  him!\\\" \\\"What do you mean they killed him!\\\" \\\"He stayed at work!\\\" \\\"Do you know  what's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.  And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very  well and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small  room, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night  talking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary  of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see  Bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed  from outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask  him things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by  soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with  the people. Apparently he had more important things to do.  Several hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \\\"Lyudochka, find another  two or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs,  lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people  who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\\\" I  had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \\\"Lyuda, your  Mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are  alive and well and that you're here.\\\" I gave the lists to someone and asked  them to continue what I was doing and went off.  The list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's father, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels Grigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the  name of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said  that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front of the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later  it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had somehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for  Krasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that  in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored  missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3  All the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were  contained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple  of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \\\"What's  going on?\\\" He said, \\\"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels they are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev [Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to him, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it was one or fifty.\\\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they should ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over again. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26 was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because that's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26  people on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only  a half of those that were on the first list. He said, \\\"Lyuda, please, try to remember at least one more.\\\" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there were more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy don't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people  whose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of the Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many  people left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns in Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the  Krasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that  there are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical  Krestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk  cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went  to help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering the city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the  Azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's more. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list  drawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course don't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to  publicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court,  they simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them is the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No.  8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know  her name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in  Microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the  same landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding  the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and  when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her  braid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because  they didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one  . . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.  They transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for days in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there  and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina;  it was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could  already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the  social work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said,  \\\"If it weren't for the work I would go insane.\\\" He and I put ourselves in gear and took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers  and free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything,  although we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been  dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it  was free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by to see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly visible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.  On March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir Fedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered  only Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital. Mother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.  Shirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I  told him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and record everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind.  We didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the conditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor  quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there  weren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a  curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or  video cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that  we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially  to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw that the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to  Sumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with  Bibishev, I told him myself, \\\"Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two  months, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in those two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation.\\\"  He and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I gave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to her, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her- self. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x- rays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat and drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we were in Baku already, the investigator told me, \\\"How long can you go on like  this? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're not taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this investigation through. We need you.\\\" Then I started eating, because in fact I was exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart- ment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement cells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in every prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of Sumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary  confinement.  Thus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma  identified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify  anyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the  photographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one  who went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the  loose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know  his first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his  sisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that  even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will  continue looking for him.  The 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various  plants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect. Mostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only one of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and Chemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga- tor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front of me \\\"I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash simply for keeping him out of Armenia,\\\" that is, to keep him from landing in a prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even though we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological pressure--they say, \\\"Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an Armenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you in short order.\\\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.  The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire pogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then that I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was  in our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and  all the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned  them, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials from the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James  Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were  boiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had  been in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's  enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't even know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did  take worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out  slippers.  Of those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait.  Basically, the group that went seeking \\\"revenge\\\"--let's use their word for  it--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with  one of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that  black I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking part in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of  Tamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently arrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I  don't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an  Azerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know  nothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an  axe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and  threw them into the tub with water.  I remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You  know, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both  their hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey- eyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I  identified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born in the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How  did I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I  kept thinking, is that Rita or \\\"puma,\\\" which it would be if you read the word  as Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \\\"T\\\" was the one  that looks like a Latin \\\"M.\\\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind his back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to put in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and  told me that I was making a mistake, and called me \\\"dear sister.\\\" He said,  \\\"You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an  Armenian,\\\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator  asked me, \\\"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\\\" I told him, \\\"I'll tell you one more identifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The  name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\\\" He went rigid and became  pale. They told him, \\\"Put your hands on the table.\\\" He put his hands on the table with the palms up. I said, \\\"Now turn your hands over,\\\" but he didn't  turn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they  forced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently. But he insolently stuck to his story, \\\"No, I did not do anything, it wasn't  me.\\\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his hand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew into a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out  of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it.  Catching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked and the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and  back. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how,  but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or  strangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the  microphone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his last name, and he says, \\\"Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . . \\\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped.  They took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down,  because we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \\\"You're  some actress! What a performance!\\\" I said, \\\"Tolya, honestly . . . \\\" Beforehand they would always tell me, \\\"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if  nothing had happened to you.\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have any more strength or  emotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength  . . . I don't have the strength to do anything.\\\" And he says, \\\"Lyuda, how were you able to do that?\\\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching the tape, I said, \\\"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped  that high in gym class.\\\"  So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of  the 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who  beat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.  At the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his  guilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among them were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said,  \\\"Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three o'clock.\\\" He said, \\\"No, I'm not coming.\\\" They told him, \\\"If you don't come  we'll kill you.\\\" He said, \\\"Alright, I'll come.\\\" And he went.  They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He had also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a  motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him  out of his apartment and told him the same thing: \\\"Tomorrow we're going to get the Armenians. Be there.\\\" He said, \\\"No.\\\" They pulled a knife on him. He said,  \\\"I'm not going all the same.\\\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed  him several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was in the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that  we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.  I'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he beat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he was very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for him, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning of Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our  apartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our  apartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I  don't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked out very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina because he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the courtyard, he remained in the apartment.  At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her I learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't  have a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third and, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work with bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.  The others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't call them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out someone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, \\\"I don't  understand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\\\" But we know that they were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the name of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam-- that's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do. Because I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their level of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they work, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they  crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were  promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments. So off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \\\"they  promised us apartments.\\\"  Among them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the heart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a  children's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at  the children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they  have they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or  grandparents. And he said, \\\"I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how I ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my  own, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\\\" And the whole time I kept repeating, \\\"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife  right before your own eyes.\\\" He sat there and just wailed.  But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a  marvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just  have to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his grandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how  to cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he  knew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed  himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.  That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr  Gambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \\\"Let's go, enough, you've spilled enough blood here.\\\"  Maybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was  that they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya and her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They  liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When  Karina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors  old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to  the entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were  already at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back and started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have  sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older  woman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of  Karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off. The woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands  and led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth,  he sees everything, and He won't forgive this.  There was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first  floor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a custom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them. But they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is  tantamount to trampling a woman's honor.  Now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we  have gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these  events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come  about? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that  without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not  have happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis, let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their  nations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are  a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for what they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they  threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done, to snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on February 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone  who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left for their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got as far away as their legs would carry them.  February 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came  into my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had  been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for  a meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few  teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or  seven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there  were a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the  evening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and  the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the  microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the  driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani child off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had seen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \\\"Death to the Armenians! They must be killed!\\\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because  people were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The  woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians  cut her daughters' breasts off, and called, \\\"Sons, avenge my daughters!\\\" That  was enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the  direction of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.  We stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a  very nationalist speech. He said, \\\"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\\\" This  he repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him  stormily, whistling and shouting \\\"Karabagh!\\\" He said, \\\"Karabagh has been our  territory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my  heart?\\\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \\\"It's our  territory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated.  From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from time immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years  the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\\\" By filth he meant  Armenians.  I heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely. Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with  the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate, that in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our teachers said, \\\"Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's  spouting,\\\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we  listened to the woman's speech.  Right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the  subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of studies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I had considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to  obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me, \\\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If  they find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I  tell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?\\\" When he  said it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a  second time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already after eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered,  \\\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until  twelve. Stay here.\\\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in  kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \\\"I left my  children at the kindergarten.\\\" The director excused her. When she let her go I turned around, said, \\\"Good-bye,\\\" and left with the young teacher, the  Azerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.  When we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran nearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too  much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed  off. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher  wouldn't say that I was an Armenian.  To make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at  the movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and again my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched  television as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last  day. That's how it all was.  At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together, Zhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store  on Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she  doesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father  held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the  ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went  out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the  entryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders  there. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the  moment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been  injured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor,  and their children: any way they could.   Where it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin,  Armen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims  what was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one  another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even  with muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and  their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got  them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked  electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then  they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an  Azerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director and told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to  escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of  course, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only thing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The  Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored  personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and led everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored  personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that  very moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.  I heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big,  strong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a  strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.  One of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking  for the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected,  people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps  dead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went  with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found  Azerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and  put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or  infection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the  neighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject  came up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the  basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor carried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing  as one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor  took his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything  seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing  of ours he had managed to \\\"save.\\\"  Raya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended  themselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were Azerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some  reason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just  victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too.  In the TV show \\\"Pozitsiya\\\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that  the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not  important, the truth will come out regardless.  So that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our  bravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the  years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've  become, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.  On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said that it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments received by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans  will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the  Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga- tion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on  the street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear speaking our native tongue.     October 15,1988    Yerevan     - - - reference for #008 - - -  [1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,     Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by     Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D. Caratzas, NY, pages 118-145  \",\" I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points. However, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I feel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more.   IMHO  Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not think he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the game. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I still would not back him for the Hall of Fame.  Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are (in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a bit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he was with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I think it deserves some consideration.  Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of Kingman.  Darrell Evans - No.  Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although a silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not sure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both the average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just think, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.  Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the top of my head I would take Lee Smith first.   Well, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I talked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers offensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have shattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved games? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more than numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers). Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does George Brett who also belongs in this class of player.   Steve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone making a case for him.   Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might bring up his name.  Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still has time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately.  Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him having some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not hear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even top 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame because of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers - even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL the possible votes.  So in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.  Yes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan Maybe - Murray and L. Smith No - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman  As I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this up - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.\",\"I have a few questions I'd like to ask; First,How would someone(me)be able to get a dealers license     and second,besides dear old departed gramp's,where would I find a good place to learn gunsmithing.   all replies appreciated!

In my five years of education in this field, though brief  compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of  question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or CS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this kind of question is irrelevant.      I have come to believe that choosing CS because one  does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does not like to program is really doing an injustice of building and computer and making it useful for something.  Everything is interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a  part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.   My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision based on which major will give you the best opportunities to  learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your  persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to explore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the school would make a student choose a major before her/his sophamore year.                     Hey you may be so interested in this field that you  decided to learn all about the making of computers in which  case, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.   About the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you are good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else.  If you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.

(now what does require some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation of what's out there....) But there is NO evidence - pro or con - for the existence or non-existence of God (see what I have to say below on this).   Sorry if I remain skeptical - I don't believe it's entirely a conclusion. That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God is correct - neither have I. But lack of evidence for the existence  of something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something  (the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they  disprove evolution the establish creation). You (personally) have never  seen a neutrino before, but they exist. The \\\"pink unicorn\\\" analogy breaks down and is rather naive. I have a scientific theory that explains the  appearance of animal life - evolution. When I draw the conclusion that  \\\"pink unicorns\\\" don't exist because I haven't seen them, this conclusion has it's foundation in observation and theory. A \\\"pink unicorn\\\", if it did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities. That is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from \\\"more primitive\\\" ancestors these pink unicorns would share  a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. God, however, has no such correspondence with anything (IMO). There is no physical frame work of observation to draw ANY conclusions FROM.      I disagree with you profoundly on this. I haven't defined God as existence - in fact, I haven't defined God. But this might be getting off the subject - although if you think it's relevant we can come back to it.    You are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand what I'm saying. I'm making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy. I'm not trying to convince you of anything. *I* Believe - and that rests upon Faith. And it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you that they can logically prove God or that they have \\\"evidence\\\" or ..., then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).  BTW, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not EVEN wrong.    I don't follow you here. Certainly one can make observations of things that they didn't know existed. I still maintain that one cannot use observation to infer that \\\"God does not exist\\\". Such a positive assertion requires a leap.       Once again you seem to completely misunderstand me. I have no EVIDENCE that \\\"'god is' is meaningful\\\" at ANY level. Maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of God down your throat. I, however, am not doing this. I am arguing one, and only one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap - it requires faith. I am, as you would say, a \\\"theist\\\"; however, there is a form of atheism that I can respect - but it must be founded upon honesty.     \",\" C'mon, Tommy Soderstrom is having a fine rookie (I think he's a rookie) season with the Flyers.

Write yourself a minimal \\\"file system\\\" program that is used to create/delete files, en/decrypt them to ramdisk, list a directory. Put the util, password protected, on a floppy.     The catch is that the storage space used by this util is NOT part of the DOS file system.  Instead, defrag your disk, thus packing all allocated clusters into clusters 0-n.  Then use the back end of the partition to hold your 'stealth' file system.  Or, leave a small 2nd partition on the disk that is not assigned to DOS.  Another approach might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files (DOS system files, for instance).  Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage  unit of a \\\"cluster\\\" there is unused physical space on the disk between the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster. These dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file system.

And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the inevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are doing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is possible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the eyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing people for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and Annias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His plan might be accomplished.     But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to execute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to fulfill the chorus of \\\"Let his blood be upon our hands\\\" of the crowd in Jersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel, which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish other nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament.  Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, \\\"Mene, mene, tekel, peres?\\\"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's justice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians as their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the extirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel.  The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and the Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go on with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is quite clear. Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to question why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom, He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans 9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of Jesus Christ is as follows: \\\"Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.\\\"  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - \\\"Let the dead bury the dead, come, follow me.\\\"  There is not an infinite amount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to follow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, \\\"well, alright, you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your plans.\\\"  He said \\\"Follow me.\\\"  His message is NOT \\\"I'm just a sweety-pie who would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and Divine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale.\\\"  \\\"Our great God and Savior\\\" Jesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the world.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.\",\" Shure it is temperature dependent, but this does not clean all your problems.

On the <-> contrary, to anyone who understands the game, they have strengthened it. < <No, I originally argued that the Second Amendment was \\\"a little bit <and an anachronism.\\\"  These prohibiting laws are examples why the are <an anachronism.

Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the people almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are there to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'.  For example, a majority could vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc. and it would fly using the logic above.  When government feels the Constitution is not right for the times, there is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis is deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those who decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a majority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting the hangee.  What the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around the limitations on the government, probably because they know that the people would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind tampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns has been very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it just shows how gullible the people have become to \\\"I am from the government and am here to help you sort of line\\\".  We have been lied to, fed half truths, rigged stats, while the government knows their control laws have no effect on crime.  They want a government monopoly on force, pure and simple.  Do you REALLY want the government to be able to override Constitutional limitations by a simple vote of a bunch of elitists (congresscritters)?  I sure don't.  The Founding Fathers sure as hell didn't, either.  <> Mox nix, Mr. Rutledge.

John has described some of these.  On the other hand, some people  seem to start tuning out `the same old words' and pay attention better  when things get changed around.

People might quibble about what \\\"intrinsically\\\" means but the reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we are. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good, but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a  different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do not realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking  on water until a little doubt crept in.  Doesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm \\\"what is man that you [God]  should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower  than the angels\\\"?  I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David was, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath was, but David's power easily defeated Goliath's.  Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what he can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments. I always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done that his whole life, probably anticipating an \\\"attaboy\\\" from the  Messiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything and follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say how can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people. Jesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.  Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid getting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing adultery, we can control our own desires.   I realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how other people see this.    (Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)  Your point about how \\\"hard\\\" other religions are is a good one, just  as your \\\"Parting Question\\\" is a tough question. I think that Muslims worship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name \\\"submission\\\". Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that \\\"God\\\" is impersonal.  Is God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little more my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater  to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but you're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more I must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond my conception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu's conception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology then maybe I wouldn't have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.

For the sake of brevity, I'll present them in some separate     points.      1- As many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of     misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the     program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows:      - It was alleged that:\\\" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah's technological     advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of     change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. \\\"!     These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives      of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology     in Iran after revolution.      -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors     while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen     Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in     contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and     civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.      - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi     aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most     radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total     of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million     dead left from the war.      - The translation of Iranian officials' talks are not 100% true. For     example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: \\\" It hurts me to     see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda.\\\" The      research.\\\"!      2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought     by Iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to      undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to Iran's     big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in     near future and its current deficit in electrical power.      3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of      Technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the     program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed     society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account     the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its     potential role in improvement of Iran's industries and eventually the     lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries     to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones     in scientific and industrial efforts.      4- A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as     much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from     Iran's different sites. They say: \\\"We are not sure if the places visited     by IAEA are the real ones or not\\\" !, or \\\" We can not rely on IAEA's     reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear     activities before\\\" as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build     nuclear weapons!      5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the     program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,     William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking     from the absolute knowledge!         I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their     country in western media, and I hope Iranian authorities continue to     their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs     and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.

Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable with the use of state sponsored coercion.  The notion that coercion can be virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious  consideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.    For example, does \\\"non-initiated force\\\" (coercion) include tax collection? Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned by Adam Smith?  Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the state, how is the state to deal with it?  Exclusively through after the fact arbitration/legal compulsion?     Well, I must admit that the picture of libertarians as Amway participants is somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a  complex, conflictual, industrial society.  I'd venture to point out,  however, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group  of \\\"seminar participants\\\" to \\\"embrace\\\" their philosophy, their  propaganda skills need to be honed.    Frankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a  society in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper government policy.  Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalities can be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  And as Mr. Marx said, the state will just wither away.    On the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating  virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the  current society will help us to live happier lives?

Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom of the 13th.  Who won the game?  -Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs. -Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent  defensive plays behind him to do so. -Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and  got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of  the inning.  Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for the win.  How about the offense? -Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either  one, the Sox would have lost in nine. -Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single. -Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first  to third when... -Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning. -Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of  a help, but it was something. -Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the  way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)  Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as much as Richardson?  Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with only one out!  Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.

From LA Times, Friday, April 9, 1993.  P. A1.    EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer    SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the  Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a  nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than  950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as  12,000 people.    Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco  authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how  operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and  infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,  right-wing and what they called \\\"pinko\\\" organizations.    Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known  organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting  anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking  any laws.    Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to  gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los  Angeles and San Francisco.    Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political  spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan  Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish  Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of  directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San  Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.    People who were subjects of the spy operation included former  Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.  LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who  is based in South Africa.    Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was  confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement  agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and  organizations was sold separately to the South African government.    In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from  police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony  counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West  Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify  the search warrant.    The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than  25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.  Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in  San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation  Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax  attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not  be reached for comment, his office said.    Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a  panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial  recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a  former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.    The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied  repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.  League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an  employee and have said they simply traded information with police  departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.    But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,  San Francisco police alleged that \\\"ADL employees were apparently less  than truthful\\\" in providing information during an earlier search  conducted without a warrant.    David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said  the organization has not violated the law.  \\\"There is nothing  nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,\\\" he said.  \\\"Our  record speaks for itself.\\\"    The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret  fund used to pay for \\\"fact-finding operations.\\\"  Lehrer, according to  the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.  Patterson.    An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to  a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending  them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.    Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for  nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with  San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many  sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as  \\\"Skins\\\" and \\\"Pinkos,\\\" but that did not necessarily mean that they were  under surveillance.    \\\"I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,\\\" Bullock said.  \\\"And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a  threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,  say, 'Pinko.'\\\"    In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police  Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he  was questioned by the FBI in the case.    A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records  and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,  vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license  photographs.    Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and  Bullock also provided information to the South African government,  receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.    The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the  South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss  nature of the spy operation.    The file notes that Kraft's articles \\\"appear frequently in The Times  and are well researched and written,\\\" but little else about the file  is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another  Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong  Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal  information.    Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how  Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from  skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash  of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his  own paid informants under code names such as \\\"Scott\\\" and \\\"Scumbag.\\\"    He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,  exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,  including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.    It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying  on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African  government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an  agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the  probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The  Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather  information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,  Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and  investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league  offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of  San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax  Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to  cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los  Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that  some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may  have come from Los Angeles police officers.        From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.    ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.    SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a  civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities  who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential  police information on citizens and groups.    But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation  League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many  felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax  violations and conspiracy.    Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful  about its spying operations, which collected information on more than  12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political  spectrum.    Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show  that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept  files on political figures.    Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down  its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when  deciding what charges to file.    In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.  Foxman described the ADL as \\\"a Jewish defense agency which has fought  to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80  years.\\\"    Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on  extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing  information to police, journalists, academics, government officials  and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain  information illegally, he said.    \\\"Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and  physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or  identity of any source of information,\\\" Foxman said.    The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its  longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than \\\"a private  individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'\\\"    Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements  showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through  Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.    \\\"Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be  distanced from ADL,\\\" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.  Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.    Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate  with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn  over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's  offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.    A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,  produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial  transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it  will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.    \\\"The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,\\\"  the district attorney said.\",\"  I am told (by the person who I care a lot about and who I am worried is going to start putting his health and money into homeopathy without really knowing what he is getting into and who is the reason I posted in the first place about homeopathy) that in Britain homeopathy is available on the National Health Service and that there are about 6000 GPs who use homeopathic practices.

One you have supplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the future (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating high-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less), I am not  going to care much about US confidentiality, am I?

One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.   Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable for a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware? In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you just swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of that cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that it would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search algorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware. I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.   However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its  designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion  of such techniques seems credible.  Hmmm...

Lack of a marriage certificate doesn't force a couple to break up.  This is an excuse used by homosexuals because the  alternative is to ask why they are so much more promiscuous than  straights.   \",\"Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral, other than Leviticus? So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from Leviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be ignored by Christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).  Later, Max (Bob) Muir  [The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly cited passages are:  the story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and there's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate position on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the Bible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been known specifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a cesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes, homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action described.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about as many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of guests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically about homosexuality.  In the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom 1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil. Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about idolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at least result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this passage.  It does not use the word \\\"homosexuality\\\", and it is referring to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality. So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality. But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway, that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards  homosexuality.  The other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim 1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used here mean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning, such as \\\"wanton\\\", and that another may be specifically \\\"male prostitute\\\".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching about homosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul shared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.  Jude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  The context in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in Sodom were angels, it seems likely that \\\"strange flesh\\\" refers to intercourse with angels.  As you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion is determined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that the passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OT prohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT endorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and no clear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in Rom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly do the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is legitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his background and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.  This is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long dissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it's clear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down to is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This appears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as a whole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today. This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference between Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both sides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the other side will finally come to their senses.  That makes things very frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic outcome is not very likely...\",\"  For a brief, but pretty detailed account, try Hempel's _Philosophy of Natural Science_.   This smacks a bit of ideology -- the supposition being that Toricelli's subsequent descriptions of his reasoning are not veridical.  It gets dangerously close to an unfalsifiable view of the history and methodology of science if we deny that no subsequent reports of experimenters are reliable descriptions of their \\\"real\\\" reasons.   But my point is that this type of case is *not* a rarity.  In fact, I was going to point to Pasteur as yet another rather common example -- particularly the studies on spontaneous generation and fermentation.  I will readily concede that \\\"ridiculous reasons\\\" can play an important role in how scientists spend their time.

Right now, I'm just going to address this point. When the Jewish National Fund bought most of its land, It didn't buy it from the Palestinians themselves, because, for the most part, they were tenant farmers (fallahin), living on land owned by wealthy Arabs in Syria and Lebanon. The JNF offered a premium deal, so the owners took advantage of it.   It's called commerce.  The owners, however, made no  provisions for those who had worked for them, basically shafting  them by selling the land right out from under them. They are to blame, not the Jews.  \",\"       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Is this Tony Esposito?  If memory serves me correctly, Chicago.

Judaism did not father Islam.  We had many of the same prophets, but Judaism ignores prophets later prophets including Jesus Christ (who Christians and Muslims believe in) and Mohammed.  The idea of believing in one God should unite all peoples.  However, note that Christianity and Islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views and the rights of non-Christians and non-Muslims are stated in each religion.   We are supposed to pay 6% of our income after all necessities are paid.  Please note that this 6% is on a personal basis - if you are poor, there is no need to pay (quite the contrary, this money most often goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor Muslims around the world).  Also, this money is not required in the human sense (i.e. a Muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money and nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid (and we surely don't pass money baskets around during our prayer services)).  God's presence is certainly on Earth, but since God is everywhere, God may show signs of existence in other places as well.  We can not say for sure where God has shown signs of his existence and where he has not/.  The Qur'an is not a copyright of the Taurah.  Muslims believe that the Taurah, the Bible, and the Qur'an originally contained much the same message, thus the many similiarities.  However, the Taurah and the Bible have been 'translated' into other languages which has changed their meaning over time (a translation also reflects some of the personal views of the translator(s).  The Qur'an still exists in the same language that it was revealed in - Arabic.  Therefore, we know that mankind has not changed its meaning.  It is truly what was revealed to Mohammed at that time.  There are many scientific facts which were not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later such as the development of the baby in the mother's womb.

I assumed, that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the  input value, and divides it over the wave period. / Right?/    Now, I used it to measure the same  square wave as above, but distorted  by high-frequency harmonics. Ideally, output should be the same, but... The output value was only about 10% of the previous one!     Why? What is the nature of this output value? What does the voltmeter  actually measure? And what does it show?       Related question (less important to me):    What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with  analog ones?

Mostly, that means water turning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would  also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.  As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in a dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private ownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe condition. If any random private citizen could not properly keep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation is clearly appropriate.    I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community. If you look at the American  revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves from, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They didn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for  example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same old regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and destroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate. But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited for that.  There is also the question of personal and collective arms: The Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers other arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example) a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively) should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a  disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower. The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely democratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only 50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would be proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular will were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the form of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's firepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not of the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite different from the general public (at the very least, they would be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and character of the militia requires that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal weapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.\",\" Oh?

Come on, Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant. Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders.   YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**. Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.  But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel doesn't have a game like that in him.   Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about Roussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah, Dom has played well too.

Press-Democrat, April 15, 1993, p. B2: # # # #    Male sex survey: Gay activity low # # # #    A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough # #    examination of American men's sexual practices published since # #    the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2 # #    percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and # #    1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual. # # # #    The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday # #    by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than # #    the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional # #    wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report. #  # 1) So what?  Homosexuals lie about the 10% number to hide the disproportionate involvement of homosexuals in child molestation.  They also lie about \\\"10%\\\" to keep politicians scared.  # 2) It will be interesting to see the reaction when 2.5million queers #    gather in Washington DC. After all if there are only 6million of #    us then this is an event unprecidented in history...  But many of the people who will be marching aren't homosexuals, but other members of the leftist agenda.  # #The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners. # #The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3. #  # Don't forget that 25% had 20 or more partners....  Not surprising.  Remember, that study includes homosexuals as well.  # #Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson, # #and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that # #homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general # #male population.   #  # And what did this study show for number of sexual contacts for those # who said they where homosexual? Or is that number to inconvient for # you....  It wasn't published.  # #It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for # #straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically # #how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are. #  # Fuck off  Typical homoseuxal response.   \",\"A bit more than a year ago, a hernia in my right groin was discovered.  It had produced a dull pain in that area.  The hernia was repaired using the least intrusive (orthoscopic?) method and a \\\"plug and patch\\\".  The doctor considered the procedure a success.  A few months later the same pain returned.  The doctor said that he could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repair.  Now the pain occurs more often.  My GP couldn't identify any specific problem.  The surgen who performed the original procedure now says that yes there is a \\\"new\\\" hernia in the same area and he said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time.  My question to the net:  Is there a nonintrusive method to determine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is from something else?\",\"  These arethe numbers I have been stating in the past 5-10 messages. It really angers me that you insisted you were right, and that you had no clue what your own car weighed. Why didn't you check when I first told you that your figures were implausible?    I'd like to hear a better explanatin of how you come to that  conclusion from the above data.  No, sorry your wrong again. *You* quoted the del Sol as doing 0-60 in 8.1 according to C+D. Interestingly, the Stealth ES, which is *faster* than your RT does the samerun in 8.5 seconds according to C+D. Kind of embarassing isn't it? Why didn't you check the figures  before posting? It only makes you look stupid when you are caught out twice with *your own* figures.   You really should have checked.        *2* If you insist, I gave you every chance to retract, but:    Dodge Stealth ES Auto does an 8.5/16.4 - Wonder why you couldn't find it?  Do you realize that a 9k Sentra (C+D) will run a 16.7, that a Sentra SE-R or Saturn will run in the 15's? Don't you think it is kind of strange that your 222hp sports car is so easily beaten.   A Mustang 5.0, which weights about the same (according to *your* numbers), has less power and is much quicker? Care to explain. Don't be abusive, just try and come up with a rational explanation of where those 222hp went to, its a mystery to me.  \",\"Just a quick summary of recent findings re. high speed modems. Top three contenders seem to be AT&T Paradyne, ZyXEL, and US Robotics. ZyXEL has the biggest \\\"cult following\\\", and can be had for under $300, but I ignored it because I need something with Mac software, which will work without any tweaking.  The AT&T Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability. They are backordered at the moment, probably because of the special $299 price in effect until May. Its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two modems. WARNING: AT&T ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit (cables & all), and has lifetime warranty. This applies *only* when you order directly from Paradyne! I called ElekTek (one of the distributors), and they wanted to charge me $16 for cable, and gave only 1 year warranty...  USR Sportster for the Mac is also highly (but not as highly) recommended; it's only $250 from ClubMac, and if you are willing to roll your own cable and don't care about the FAXstf software, you can get the generic model from PC outlets for $190.  All this assuming that you don't have a rich uncle, and can't afford a Motorola Codex...  :-(    I ended up ordering the Dataport; we'll see how it works in two weeks or so. \",\" Well, it's not an FTP site, but I got an 800 number for Signetics BBS.

The result, which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period.  That was their argument to prove that you don't go wrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry.   Now, if I remember correctly, the Camry costs about $4000 or so more in initial costs.  Essentially, it means that you spend about $4000 extra on repairs on the Taurus.  That is ridiculous.  Every time your car needs repairs, it is extra hassles, loss of time and a dozen other things. I would much rather spend $5000 more in initial costs than spend $4000 more in repair costs. \",\" You assume this because you believe in a designing creator, and you observe our ability to procreate...   ....

This description   1. ignores the role of the ballast,  2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.  The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts short circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much less heat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared to the neon discharge.  The starter contacts open before the tube fires.  Actually, the tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballast because of this immediate opening of the starter's contacts.  A capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent excessive arcing during the firing.  The neon reionizes but does not draw sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself.\",\" The third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than Apple's. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.   That's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire (BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240 all have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly remembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all of them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered DESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used with a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.  My advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:  (1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add     machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going     for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which     means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.     As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it     unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).  (2) On the Mac side, you will need:     - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).     - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).     - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be       getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).     - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the       Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is       self-terminated or not.     - configure MacTCP to use \\\"Ethernet\\\".  (3) On the DECstation side, you will need:     - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.     - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.

I want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap once I start running out of allocatable cells, using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color.  Once I determine if a cell is read-only, I assume I can then just request an XAllocColor() with the exact same color specifications and it will  then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another application.  So far, the only way I've figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors, once my colormap is all full up.  It should error out if the cell is non-shareable. But life would be much easier if I could just detect the read-only/shareable stuff directly...

I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to  main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate, and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the F.B. followed by a write)  If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in CPU main memory, the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower, depending on your OS's implementation of shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window, which is also then just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device.  One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large, you don't end up growing the size of the server process to hold them.  One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that, in its sample implementation, there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., \\\"kill\\\").  You have to  be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.   Ken\",\"Sorry about that - don't want to alarm anyone...

From a theological bent, those who lived immediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son Nimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a stronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of hardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on his shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.  It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and thus he became the \\\"Elevator of the heavens.\\\"  This \\\"god\\\" made men able to \\\"feel\\\" as if heaven were afar off and \\\"as if either the God of Heaven could not see through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of His laws.\\\"  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled \\\"Emancipator\\\" or \\\"Deliverer\\\"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system and abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many benefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a Deliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the other actually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it as true.   I don't see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to the coming \\\"Anointed One\\\" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who was to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the Crucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the dispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it as a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation via faith and nothing else.   I understand what you're trying to convey, but I don't think I'd lay hold of it because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal life is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of consciousness.     It depends upon your def of \\\"lost.\\\"  The elect were lost only in time as outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world.  Existentially we were all born \\\"lost\\\", but the \\\"righteous\\\" were \\\"in Christ\\\" and therefore never *assuredly* lost.

That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings to light. The \\\"Mystery of Iniquity\\\" that we find in the Bible, correlates to this I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately, little by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.

NEWSPOT, May 1992   GREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS  The  Xanthi independent  MP Ahmet  Faikoglu said  that the  Greek state is trying to cut all  contacts and relations of the Turkish minority with Turkey.  Pointing out that while the  Greek minority living in Istanbul is called \\\"Greek\\\"  by ethnic  definition, only  the religion  of the minority in  Western Thrace is  considered. In an  interview with Turkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in Western Trace are also Turkish.\\\"  Emphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in Western  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement signed in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey in Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace.  Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr. SadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority, Faikoglu said.  \\\"In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we prevented Greece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European countries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal rights.\\\"  On Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are predestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical reasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign powers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by cooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was will to improve relations with Greece.  NEWSPOT, January 1993   MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.  Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.    Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine.    Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly magazine  \\\"ENA\\\"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek general election.    Bulev said in the interview: \\\"I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.\\\" Sideropoulos said  in the  article that \\\"Greece  should recognise Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the border, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC are falling.\\\"    The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court summons,  was   that  \\\"they  have   spread...intentionally  false information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the citizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the international interests of the country (Greece).\\\"    The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian.    In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000 in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.    Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian human rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live.    Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent, especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.    Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections are over.

Khomeini put a  price on the head of someone in another country, this makes him a jerk as well as an international outlaw. Khomeini advocates the view that there was a series of twelve Islamic leaders (the Twelve Imams) who are free of error or sin. This makes him a heretic. In the Qur'an  Muhammad is chastised for error directly by God; the Qur'an says that Muhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior; thus no muslim is free from error.     Perhaps it seems so to you, but this is hardly the case. There is widespread agreement about matters of Islam. There certainly are many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly Islamic in and of themselves, but this is so for any large group of people under the same name.    The Qur'an is not particularly imprecise in wording, though it is true that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of many words. However, as an entire text the Qur'an makes its meanings precise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come to agreement about them.   \",\"I was wondering if anyone knew any changes to the temple ceremony within the last fifty years....

It sounds like you might want to send an exposure using XSendEvent and specifying a region. If you know the region you need to send the exposure, generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects, you can use XCreateRegion to create a region, XUnionRectWithRegion to add the new object polygons to the region, and then either use the region to clip your GC for the redraw or use XRectInRegion to test which of your other objects need to be redrawn.

A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.

For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth, you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer. A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be the payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within the capability of the amateur rocketry community.  It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reduction of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'.

People who hoard $250K worth of high-caliber automatic weapons and kill law-enforcement agents really fit the bill here.

I am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone, based on Ephesians 2 and Romans 3:21-31.  I also conclude that James 2, when  read in context, is teaching bullet (2) above. When James speaks of  justification, I would claim that he is not speaking of God declaring the believing sinner innocent in His sight (Paul's use of the word).  Instead he is speaking of the sinner's profession of faith being  \\\"justified\\\" or \\\"proven\\\" by the display of good works. Also according  to James 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a \\\"dead\\\" or  \\\"useless\\\" faith which fails to save.  James 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it is teaching (2).  Works would have their place, not as merit toward  salvation, but as evidence of true faith.

Participants who complete the program can earn two semester hours of graduate credit from Aurora College. Please note that while the class is intended for teachers, it is not restricted to teachers.  The class, which is being cosponsored by the United States Space Foundation, will teach how to use space exploration as a teaching tool to get students excited about learning and interested in science.  Classroom topics to be covered by the class include:      > Living in Space      > The Space Shuttle      > The Space Station      > NASA Spinoffs that Benefit Society      > Principles of Astrodynamics/Aeronautics      > The Solar System  There will also be simulated Zero-G training in an underwater space station simulation, model rocket launches, observing sessions at the Harper College Observatory, and field trips to the Adler Planetarium and the Museum of Science and Industry.  Featured speakers include Jerry Brown of the Colorado based United States Space Foundation and Debbie Brown of the NASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Additional instructors will be provided by the Planetary Studies Foundation.  The social highlight of the class will be a dinner banquet featuring Space Shuttle Payload Specialist Byron Lichtenberg, currently President of Payload Systems, Inc. Lichtenberg was a member of the crew of STS-9 which flew in November 1983. The banquet is scheduled for Thursday, June 17.  The registration fee includes transportation for field trips, materials, continental breakfasts, lunches, and the special dinner banquet. Guest tickets for the dinner banquet are also available.  There is an additional charge to receive the two hours of graduate credit. For any additional information about the class, contact the Science Learning Center at (708) 359-7913.

Automatic setups are fine for simple, repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more complex events where you need to understand how the scope is actually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope in \\\"equivalent time\\\" or in \\\"real time\\\" sampling mode (equivalent time being a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to the trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling rate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but before display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.  Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz sample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front end including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for equivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really only helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single sample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.  So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get useful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for general use and the digital for events where I need storage for later analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability of the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to fall...  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin   Phone: (205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking    (205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

If you study the  meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will come to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere  belief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your  belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this  is what James means when he says that \\\"faith without works is dead\\\"  and, \\\"I will show you my faith by my works.\\\"  Remember James was  writing to \\\"the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.\\\"  This  probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much  later and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek. (Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he intended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the people of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of the Greek.  Another key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul's statements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the gospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great burden of Paul's life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go convert a bunch of people, then the \\\"Judizers\\\" would come along and try to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf Acts chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being saved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood of Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation for today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think \\\"faithfulness\\\" today has a meaning closer to what the original writers intended.   I think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is that God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not \\\"keep kosher\\\" to a kosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters of following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.   In the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and  be lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are  worse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in the parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in the one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that the price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.  [I agree with you in general, including the fact that \\\"pistis\\\" has some of the force of \\\"faithful\\\".  However if you take that too far, you can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have intended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we are saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that's not what you meant.  I have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that completely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I'd call a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and commitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic change.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show the new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any Christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that Jesus calls being born again.\",\"I'm interested in simulating reverse (or negative) color video mathematically.

Chris Mussack\",\"A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView. Since he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post it for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:  CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most annoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to do with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its \\\"current directory\\\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell) when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView doesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems  to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \\\"dithering\\\", again writing another file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this second file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does the last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to your screen again.  (It does this last \\\"recopy\\\" operation for its \\\"fit to screen\\\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)   The result of this process is the following:         1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all         you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of         data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never         realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.       2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for         the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the         dithering and writes to the screen card.         However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data         from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)         one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which         there was room on the disk.  This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general idea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details about file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient disk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be very large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess of 6 Meg free disk space.   CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from a floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the floppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT table? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly unrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files menu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing? \",\"-*-----  I think the question is: What is extra-scientific about this?

Brian West\",\" There are many organisms, viral, bacterial, and fungal, which can cause meningitits, and the course of these infections varies widely. The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adults pneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia) is the most common cause, while in children Hemophilus influenzae is the most common cause.  What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis, which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in both groups, but with lower incidence in infants. This organism is also called the \\\"meningococcus\\\", and is the source of the common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in the press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases), the organism typically causes death within a day.   This organism, feared as it is, is actually grown from the throats of many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by different ways, but blood borne spread is probably the usual case.   Rifampin (an oral antibiotic) is often given to family and contacts of a case of meningococcal meningitis, by the way.  Sorry, but I don't have time for a more detailed reply.

Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to education, to establish a family and have children, to human dignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are more important to human existence that the rights of states.  2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.  3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an unresolved conflict exists.  4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples and nations.  5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.  6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional political means have failed.  7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the land, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.  8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice. When people love, they share.  Having stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.  1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew and the other Palestinian-Arab.  2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner, although born in areas under current Isreali control, is not entitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.  3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For the second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each subsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.   4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and Christian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of governments and international organizations.  5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on 'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the Middle-East in a graceful manner.  Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will attempt to identify some of these:  1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However, it is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation.  2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the 'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but Israeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be defeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights (see above)  3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their point of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People overrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of human rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar Bronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing assimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its effects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see above)  4.      It may objected that only a few people in Israel/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes.  5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has merits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than $3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government and by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the Middle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a non-segregated society in that worn-torn land.  I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment.\",\" What group is this?

True, Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still, these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with lots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereas Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.      That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb pitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of a chance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no pitching.  At least, to me.      I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team with Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real order, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but with a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.) Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig, Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.      I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by seasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in their best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all the players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And all the offense would have to do is get 1 run across.

Don't you?\",\"[remainder of message deleted]  Pardon me for replying to only a portion of your message :)  The reason we can say \\\"God just exists\\\" and can't say \\\"The universe just  exists\\\" is because the universe is a natural realm and is subject to natural  laws in general and the law of cause and effect in particular.  That is, we  observe in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced  by a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be  its own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.  God, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject  to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being,  God's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence  of a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the  supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused  phenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the  supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very  nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.  This is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted  to clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the  natural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being  interchangeable.\",\"Hi,  I am looking for a PC card which does european videotext/teletext descrambling (PAL).

In short, I am happy with the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time futzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor is pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17\\\" Magnavox went away.  It isn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the monitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.  In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA, Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those are all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite card does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3 cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.  The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors listed plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have, and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.  The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone with Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable to recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.  The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they were close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz 386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers were all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with 8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it computes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.   K means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second               Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000 Chip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000 DIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K Memory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M Screen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M Vector, solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M Vector, styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K Polygon, shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M Polygon, hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M Ternary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K Font                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M  The DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers it to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as conversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to the screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can just be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that face from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie, filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics operations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two numbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching. When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly -- 1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds like programming to a benchmark to me....  I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what I saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers, but this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my work (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the knowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company.\",\"...  I tried to respond by email, but all attempts bounced.  The condition of the Ctrl key BEFORE you press the mouse button makes no difference whatsoever.  You have to be holding the Ctrl key when you RELEASE the mouse button if you want to force a copy operation.  Here's a simple experiment.  Select a file and begin to drag it (no Ctrl key).  Notice that the file's icon disappears from the listing window.  Now watch what happens to that icon as you press and release the Ctrl key (keeping the mouse button pressed all the while).  In addition, the icon that you are dragging will show a \\\"+\\\" while you are holding the Ctrl key, indicating that the file is being copied rather than moved. \",\"        This isn't inherently bad.

Rick \",\"Obesssive Compulsive Disorder (not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive _Personality_ Disorder !) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by either obsessions (persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when not entertained), or compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic actions that similarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted).    OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression.    Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved one (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having  recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignore or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.   The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather than being from an external source.  Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing, or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a source of the anxiety.  In OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the individual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their daily routine and social relationships.  Treatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating obsessions and compulsions.  The standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in the DSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .        kind regards,\",\" I'll third the opinion about this outfit/franchise. Now, when I buy over the net and pick up the shipping costs, I'll specify that I only pick up the normal UPS charges (as if delivered directly to UPS), as I've been burned by $10 shipping charges for a $2.49 pkg. I will never use a mailing service unless I don't have the right box and the buyer needs whatever IMMEDIATELY. I'll also tell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on.  Other things to watch out for/consider:   The rates are $5 to $30 higher than UPS direct.   For a non-UPS (truck) package, they quoted a rate  of $85. Fed Ex economy air was only $85 for the  same weight! RPS (a trucking package company, in many  cities) only wanted $18. Guess who got it. The Mailbox  operator told me I was not telling the truth about  competitors' rates, said RPS was unreliable (I've used them  before with NO problems), etc. Right.   A COD check goes to the mailing service. Our local  Mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the  remade check. All this for an additional $3.00 over the  UPS COD charge. What a deal.... :-)   For packages over $100, they charge you about double over  what UPS charges them for insurance. I've never had  a claim, but other netters (is Ralph Seguin out there?)  have told horror stories about them...   All package traces have to be done through Mailbox by  Mailbox.   Our local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I  asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared  to direct UPS. Does he ever check? Probably not...   Their UPS ground rates come close to Fed Ex's economy  air rate, and Fed Ex will pick up!   UPS will pick up for a $5 charge in most areas!   --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin   Phone: (205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking    (205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because    they are not quoted by the NT authors.  That is not quite accurate.  Otherwise we would have the book of Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the  apocrypha are not quoted by Christ.     III. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because    they teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted)    parts of the canon.     then I answer:     These is a logically invalid *a priori*.     Besides, we are talking about OT texts-     which in many parts are superceded by the NT    (in the Xtian view). Would not this same    principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_?    This principle cannot be consistently applied.   I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one voice, and he does not contradict himself.    The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example, the Lutheran hymn \\\"Now Thank We All Our God\\\" quotes a passage from this book.  The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's history.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the Spirit in so doing.

Our   three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release   that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.   On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family   will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public   awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease   characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and   trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would   lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.    Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis   last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her   lifetime.    Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives   of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory   Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide   support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a   newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid   in the prevention, cure, and treatment.  Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to   those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money   were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant   attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP   Foundation's mission is to change that.   Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call   Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the   Foundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown   Princeton, or sent directly to:\",\": The Swiss population is (and well was) far larger than that.

They had died as the helpless must, with  their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself.\\\"   Serdar Argic\",\" In the case of victimless crimes yes, I think so.  Think about it.  If I rob or beat up or rape or kill someone, it's very clear to anyone not a sociopath that I've done something immoral.  On the other hand, if I smoke grass or have sex with a consenting adult in a manner illegal in that state, the morality or immorality of that act is merely a lifestyle choice; it doesn;t clearly hurt anyone else.  IMO, if such an act doesn;t hurt another person it should not be interfered with.   I think so.  And I don't use drugs, outside of the legal ones (alcohol and coffee).\",\"I'm getting ready to buy a multimedia workstation and would like a little advice.

It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began, whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.  Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of \\\"election fraud\\\" to hold their jobs.  Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too many cases, who they were).  Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.  The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room.  One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy. He said, \\\"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is always so organized every year.\\\"  I got a little pissed, and replied, \\\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\\\"  At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and several Simon's Rock anti-gun \\\"close-the-loophole\\\" protestors. (Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)  The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.  Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up to \\\"support GOAL's position\\\" on \\\"all bills.\\\"  First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students had some curfew, I guess).    Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock folks called the current law a \\\"loophole\\\" and wanted it closed.  Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \\\"SKS assault rifle.\\\" The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri, and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \\\"as strong as\\\" that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.  Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  \\\"In some of these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\\\" (Oooooo!)  \\\"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't be having this situation -- but they won't.\\\"  (Naughty, naughty!)  Next up was Boston city councilman Albert \\\"Dapper\\\" O'Neill.  He was there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were judge, he'd give arrestees their \\\"last rights\\\" (pun intended) on the spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.) He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(  Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction -- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying, \\\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted.\\\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.  Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible. \\\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\\\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook.  The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga. Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \\\"restraining order\\\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He  was a co-sponsor of one of the \\\"restraining order\\\" bills as well.)  One of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \\\"every year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\\\" It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been more effective.  At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue. Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \\\"public\\\" testimony; the other got a seat this time.  Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change. He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great quote: \\\"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state computer system until 1999.\\\"  (This was also an argument he used against the renewable FID card.)  Testimony was heard from several \\\"battered women,\\\" one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how 50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long rambling circumlocution in response.  Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts. Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.  Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law. One of the junior reps noted that \\\"this is America\\\" and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga reiterated this, saying that \\\"people who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order.\\\"  (Point and match, Senator.)  Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his citizenship \\\"expired every 5 years,\\\" and that a driver's license was a privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.  A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public hangings.  The speaker then responded, \\\"I'll make you a deal.  You get me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\\\"  Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \\\"he wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside\\\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \\\"loophole\\\" should be closed to prevent something like this from \\\"ever happening again\\\".  Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on, saying, \\\"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are safe -- support gun control.\\\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \\\"Only residents can get FID's,\\\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off?)  Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental record.  One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \\\"elitist\\\".  Another (Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had \\\"FID-type\\\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home state was \\\"not enough.\\\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming, \\\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\\\"  All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and GOAL's position) were:  o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull     licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)  o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)  o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly    opposed)  o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws     (opposed)  o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)  o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)  o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)  o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)  o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)  Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.  Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.  Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it. Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said, \\\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\\\"  The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It ended at about 6:30. -- \",\"****UNIX****UNIX****UNIX****UNIX****UNIX****UNIX****UNIX****  FORSALE:          ESIX UNIX System V Release 4 - NEW!         2 user license system - $400         Unlimited user license system - $450         2 user license system with dev kit - $500         Unlimited user license system with dev kit - $550  The above systems include all of the floppies or tapes and instalation manuals.

It's small enough that I will attach it.  I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB cache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to 40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective difference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously better.  I do not have an FPU.  The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference between 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well under $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.  If you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to see them.

But unfortunely the Yards (a definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots. Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for most of the year like '89).   On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.  Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching staff looks pretty good.

I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original announcement.)   For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems. Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev, Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.  I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use.  If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they are rapidly changing!

To visit each moment in time sequentially or all at once, but not able to alter the actions thoughts or feelings we had/have/will have in this  life.  From that perspective, I posit that all will have direct knowledge of God, and be able to recognize at each moment of time wether we were doing what we ought.  That the experience of having lived a life far from God will be an eternal torment.  That  having lived a life of grace, will be an eternal joy.  That the  resurrection of the body comes not from any physical reconstitution of our present forms, but knowledge of our present forms by our fully cognizant souls.  As an Aside:  If we were to be restricted for all time to our present form, would you opt for immortality?  James Sledd\",\"  Terms are being used in a loaded way here.  \\\"Logical proof\\\" is an extremely messy thing to apply to real life. If you think otherwise, try to construct a proof that yesterday happened. Obviously it did; anyone old enough to be reading this was there for it and remembers that it happened. But *proof*? A proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere. You need axioms to talk about logical proof. You can say that you remember yesterday, and that you take as axiom that anything you clearly remember happened. I could counterclaim that you hallucinated the whole thing.  To talk about proofs of historical events, you have to relax the terms a bit. You can show evidences, not proofs. Evidences of the resurrected Jesus exist. Proofs do not.\",\"  First of all, I resent your assumption that you know why I am threatened by science, or even that I am threatened at all, although I admit the latter.  The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence-- God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree, Science.   My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations, for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone. Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have  children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that is made possible.   People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death, and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world.   This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely  prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary  alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,   go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us?   I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not, but I will say this:  Before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body they have been given, they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to  believe their search is displeasing to God.\",\"NHL PLAYOFF RESULTS FOR 4/19/93.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    CONFERENCE SEMI-FINALS        BEST OF SEVEN       PATRICK              ADAMS              NORRIS              SMYTHE    NJ                  BUF   (leads 1-0)   STL   (leads 1-0)   WIN                 PIT   (leads 1-0)   BOS                 CHI                 VAN   (leads 1-0)   NYI                 MON                 TOR                 LA    (leads 1-0)   WAS   (leads 1-0)   QUE   (leads 1-0)   DET   (leads 1-0)   CAL                --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Toronto Maple Leafs                       1   1   1   -   3 Detroit Red Wings    (leads series 1-0)   1   4   1   -   6  1st period: DET, Yzerman 1 - (Gallant, Ciccarelli) 4:48      TOR, Cullen 1 - (Clark, Gill) 10:44  2nd period: DET, Sheppard 1 - (Probert, Coffey) (pp) 5:04      DET, Burr 1 - (Racine) (sh) 6;42      DET, Chiasson 1 - (Coffey) (pp) 11:00      DET, Howe 1 - (Yzerman, Drake) 14;46      TOR, Gilmour 1 - (Borschevsky, Ellett) (pp) 19:59  3rd period: DET, Racine 1 - (Primeau, Drake) 5:10      TOR, Lefebvre 1 - (Cullen, Pearson) 7:45  Powerplay Opportunities-Maple Leafs 1 of 5    Red Wings   2 of 6  Shots on Goal- Maple Leafs   5   9   9  -  23   Red Wings    13   8  12  -  33  Toronto Maple Leafs--Potvin (0-1) (33 shots - 27 saves) Detroit Red Wings--Cheveldae (1-0) (23 shots - 20 saves)  ATT-19,875  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Winnipeg Jets                           1   0   1   -   2 Vancouver Canucks  (leads series 1-0)   2   0   2   -   4  1st period: VAN, Adams 1 - (Linden, Bure) (pp) 1:23      VAN, Craven 1 - (Bure, Murzyn) 9:56      WIN, Steen 1 - (Shannon, Housley) (pp) 17:53  2nd period: NONE  3rd period: WIN, King 1 - (Barnes) 3:43      VAN, Linden 1 - (Courtnall, McLean) 12:16      VAN, Ronning 1 - (Courtnall) 18:31  Powerplay Opportunities-Jets    1 of 3    Canucks 1 of 6  Shots on Goal- Jets      7   5  10  -  22   Canucks   9  12  12  -  33  Winnipeg Jets--Essensa (0-1) (33 shots - 29 saves) Vancouver Canucks--McLean (1-0) (22 shots - 20 saves)  ATT-15,918  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \",\"I have just installed a Diamond Stealth 24 ISA card in a '486DX2-66 system with 256K cache, and 16 megs of memory, that gets about a 126 SI 6.0 CPU Benchmark rating.

Your claim that the Lebanese/Syrian Landlords sold Palestine (if true, even partially) omits the fact that the mandate treaty put Lebanon and Syria under French rule, while Palestine under british.  Obiviously, any such landlord would have found himself a foreigner in Palestine and would be motivated to sell, regardless of the price.  It is interesting though that you acknowledge that the palestinians were shafted. Do many Israelis or Jews share your opinion ?  Do you  absolve the purchaser from any ethical commitments just because it wasn't written down?   All told, I did not see an answer in your response. The question was whether the intent behind the purchase was aimed at controlling the public assets (land, infra-structure etc...). IMHO the Palestinians have grounds to contest the legality of the purchase, say in world court.  Sam \",\"Hi!  I have the following 2 CD's for sale.

Hmmm... Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was   trying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210   and my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need   to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe   place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is   that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it   wrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this   could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.    It could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one   wrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further   correct actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also   my NeXT that way.  Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any   problem, and at pretty high speeds too.  I don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is   pretty standard.\",\" Yes it is, as has been evidenced by the previous two stages of withdrawal from the area and by the reductions in troops.

In comparison, in  the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall  decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in  gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of  this disease from 1985 through 1992.       In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department  of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992,  reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively  (Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics  (15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases  with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7%  of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by  age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or  equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all  reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the  largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age  group-specific rate (639 per 100,000).       Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver  metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the  state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area  occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods  considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.       When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among  men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in  the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits  by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases  diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men,  the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised  94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among  self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992,  respectively).       Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO,  university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted  to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea  culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased  23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the  fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).       From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and  Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado  increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992,  the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for  whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000)  (Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from  1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases  increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.   Reported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE  Hoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health. JM Douglas, MD,  Denver Dept of Health and Hospitals. Surveillance and Information Systems Br,  Div of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for  Prevention Svcs, CDC.   Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992  may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more  complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH  surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea  cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories  suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact.  However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning  laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the  gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.       One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in  Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a  recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs  (2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area  coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires  further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated  previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6)  -- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom  gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs,  and gang affiliation.       The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the  national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective  19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for  gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at  greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race- specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as  socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.       In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado,  interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting  partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at  increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black  males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in  schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted  primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to  perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational  interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of  members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders  and health-care providers.

Child safety seats and safety  belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50  states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety  belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by  an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major  cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of  occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for  those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In  addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to  use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between  adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints  for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC  analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  (BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this  study.       Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to  18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based,  random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury  Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499  (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent  was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for  that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in  this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than  consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up).  Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software  for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates  and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined  by p values of less than 0.05.       Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six  (Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no  law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania,  and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a  vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse  of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary  enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a  safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states  used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use.  The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law  requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law  (no-law states).       Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not  consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and  adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square  test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus  43.2%, respectively).       High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1  year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than  consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported  high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age  (range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for  adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child- occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1%  for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of  consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult  safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age  groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).       Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded  that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition,  higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with  increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated  with increased adult safety-belt use (8).   Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National  Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others  indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely  to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these  nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit  other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater  risk for motor-vehicle injury (10).       Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with  child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs  should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low  educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such  programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve  low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are  directed at parents with young children.       Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In  addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment,  those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do  not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety  belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and  safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may  increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers --  the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the  highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES                                IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC                          AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88        Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance  systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance  in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for  the years 1983-1988.       Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program  and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population- based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The  prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983- 1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan  Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race,  sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.       Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal  alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the  kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general  diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand  limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are  probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these  defects are relatively easy to diagnose.       Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy  termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However,  the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be  related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene  pool, or random variation.       Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several  collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in  the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on  the impact of prenatal diagnosis.

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89       Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza  virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually  from October through May.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance  conducted from October 1988 through May 1989.       Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices  of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO  collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza  viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and  territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians.  Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received  throughout the year.       Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B  viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency  overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted  over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices  of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were  similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of  identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype  increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the  1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were  reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza  A(H1N1).       Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of  influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the  importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since  amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.       Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced  throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make  informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual  surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates  for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.  Authors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona                   High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies  Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF- ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been  developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT),  embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together,  these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive  technology (ART) procedures.   Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or  pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility  management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to  proceed with one of the ART procedures.   Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility  service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and  Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in  ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients  in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the  traditional therapies.   The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our  Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the  realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are:   o in vitro  o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube    transfer  o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation.  This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed  towards improved success of these technologies.

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then  subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA  amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization.   There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by  other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and  hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ  hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of  which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit  sex-linked disorders.   The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that  it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility  of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth  of affected children.

In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our  Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of  unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and  the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred  to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under  strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being  processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our  andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to  perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically  stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing  hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo  lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs  obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic  egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia,  we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our  Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.        Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal  deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male  factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall  success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per  cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173  IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.       Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is  disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological  factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well  recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous  ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle  attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant  of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an  Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of  traditional therapies.       The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not  been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs  available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates  significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years;  and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is  unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our  Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may  be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that  fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant  proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently,  the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our  program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs  of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.        GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room,  usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves  introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian  tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization  occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF,  with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for  transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such  pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility  and/or idiopathic infertility.          The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990  indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained  with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36  percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might  expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our  program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while  substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the  patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing  a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing  general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from  obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs,  and the developmental competency of resultant embryos.       The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial  environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between  January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT  cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.       Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when  embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos.  This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for  success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical  issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated  by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from  both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs  should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.       Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new,  is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but  who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in  combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10  percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the  procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under  the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm  through enzymatic digestion.       Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10  percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly  relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm.  Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques  for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such  efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology  offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to  establish conception.

There are some who don't want to turn over everything and be a disciple, some have no clue about it because they've not been taught, some have done exactly that and turned over everything to follow Jesus, some are blocked by difficult doctrine taught by uncaring Pharisees and teachers of the law. However, Jesus pointed out what it takes to follow him and to be his disciple in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33.  My question is:  why do people ignore the command and treat it as optional?

However, Miss Prophet is the leader of a group (The Church Universal and Triumphant) derived from the I AM group founded by a Mr. Ballard who began his mission in the 1930's (I am writing this from memory and may not have all the details straight -- for an old account, check your library for a bnook by Marcus Bach) after an eighteenth-century Frenchman appeared, tapped him on the shoulder, and offered him a cup of \\\"cosmic essence.\\\" A major tenet of the movement is that there is a monastery in the mountains of Tibet from which a monk descends to the lower altitudes every few centuries to preach, and that all major religions have been founded by monks from this monastery. Typically, the Ballard family and their successors, the Prophet family (related by marriage, if I remember aright), base almost all their teachings on messages they have allegedly received by telepathy from Tibet.

Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry during WWII.  3. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, children and elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last  four years.  The entire population of x-Soviet Armenia now, as a result of the  Genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people, are Armenians.   For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people  lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the  oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried  out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks  and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their  homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands  were empty of Turks and Kurds.   The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.  Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and  Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.  Today, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated  by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against  humanity.  x-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide  against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations  to the Turks and Kurds.  Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine  their own future as a nation in their own homeland.  During the 78th Anniversary, we come once again reiterate the unity of the Muslim People, the timelessness of the Turkish and Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the struggle for that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds.

It would seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of gun control laws.         I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural and enforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and then that reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.          Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a crime with it a silly solution, it still doesn't address the question of Canada.  (Which is now, by the way, blaming their rising gun-crime rate on the U.S.  Strange that the border used to \\\"magically\\\" keep the guns out, but now isn't.)          The other side of the coin, of course, is that far \\\"illegal drugs\\\" are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally.  I've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals have shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources (stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simply see South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as well, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.           And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques of it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come to mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost entirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed for poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you compared the white majority they were virutally identical.          The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs. non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative conditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of nomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into account that the non-whites in either city were not living in the same conditions.          If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns, then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which are arguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far higher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly lower.           The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. \\\"inner-city\\\" problems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a condition which is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent crime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control is the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As one Canadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun control in 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase in violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparently they didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in the early eighties.          True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., where gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that crime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.         The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high or low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact violent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than it was going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by saying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be instituted to deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, you can't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of that gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control was implemented, just as happened in Canada.          As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent of gun control.          Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what others did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would sell to them?\",\" I'll throw in a vote for a Metzler \\\"economy\\\" tire, the ME77.

I came  home from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period  in order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was  the same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and  other things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first  cousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and  on the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring  that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.  When we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped  by a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus.  The driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus begins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to  the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking  passports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not  taken for Armenians.  We set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old  building where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was  packed with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th  Microdistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking passports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well. Then we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning cars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. \\\"Death to the Armenians\\\" was written on the cars.  When we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still quiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call  Baku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come.  Then there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to  come down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us to the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you  enter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was  beaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right,  that's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people  were being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very  long in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could,  looking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said  things now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a car on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that  they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that  there weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of  the building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later  found out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri Avakian was killed, too.  When the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go  home. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We  started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We tried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We decided she had already left.  We sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my father. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father's work brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our town. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get out of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address, but my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the call a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke down the door and came into the apartment . . .  They came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians  were. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we  could do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He  read the surname \\\"Danielian,\\\" turned the page, read \\\"Armenian,\\\" and that alone was enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the  courtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him,  pushed some of the keys on the piano and said \\\"your death has tolled.\\\" They  had knives and steel truncheons.  I had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that if I didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents  and said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded that we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken  outdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to push her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind  her. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began  beating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.  We are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their  balconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they  strike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I  lose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was the first one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are lying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from  their balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is  broken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an  ambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.  We were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and  try to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door,  they push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our  neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the  window to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a  result of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken  away. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken  away, and everything will be OK.  But they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the ambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received attention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12  o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with  some \\\"assistants.\\\" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives,  and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds on my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are  in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.  In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them Armenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only Azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events, before the 27th.  Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was  released, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first  they told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out  that they were dead. My father's older brother told me.  My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My  mother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the  leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.  They were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that their heads were smashed open and bled profusely.  At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out  later, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called  specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address  and dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address. Before the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the  phone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He  denies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father  answered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he  called from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of  automobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had  never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20  years old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he  was the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.  My parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was  two years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to go to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He went off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural  projects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and  later moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from  the village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in  a bookstore, and later, on a construction site.   My sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I always loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it was their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and wanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military School. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon- sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join  the Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life long--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it more than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School, and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.  Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home  of my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.  While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had suffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at their residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long time, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I also learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped  . . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too, about a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with his parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and his parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even came to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But in the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of others, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .  Today Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia, was shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to  recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. I was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of  Armenia.  After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give Karabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live peacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they can do that.  I arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches. After a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I  think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.  You can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno Karabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had  even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move  here for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and  that what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was wrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct  a mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies  in the hands of our government.

Welbon)]         For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?   There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses word \\\"on faith\\\", we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now. If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods?   The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing, rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?   I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found.\",\"   W/r/t performance, converter lockup is purely irrelevant.

The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots  of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now  defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.  The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the  SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they  were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.  About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once  in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as  Christ.  Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young  adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over  the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.  They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of  weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US  government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were  putting themselves in a self defense position.    In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn' t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.  If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the  local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you  some insight into where Koresh got his theology.\",\"   The case report of the first xenotransplant was published in Lancet 1993; 341:65-71. I can send you a reprint if you are interested.

We're looking for more than \\\"Well, the 2-pc is more versatile, but the     1-pc is better protection,...\\\"      Thanks in advance,    Nadine   What is best? Books have been written on that! But in regard to AeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs. If you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero dimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching the 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it. Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a difference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go somewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket) you can just detach and stow the pants.   One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for many women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and petite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better.   Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish I got 2-3 inches added to my pant legs.

Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library that adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite multimedia objects to be built from media objects.  Specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the source code for the original classes (though several configuration files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file).    Currently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN workstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.  Xavier has been tested in the following environments:  SUN:   Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC   OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later   C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1  NEC(EWS):   Machine : EWS4800/210,230   OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2   C++     : C++ Release3.1  It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from            interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/           (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)  We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier.

Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by  performing studies that are \\\"blind\\\" in various ways.  Some of these are:    o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a       placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the      control group or the test group.    o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects       receive a placebo or the test treatment.    o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects      receive a placebo or the test treatment.  Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to  differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on which it is based so that others can verify it.    It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because those who performed the study did not \\\"blind\\\" themselves.

The discussion is not about whether there were tanks   used in sixties riots; instead, it is about whether those tanks fired their   main guns in one of those riots.  You claim they did.  That claim is   ludicrous.  Awesley replied:      I repeated what I had been told, under what context I had heard it,   supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in Detroit in 67.  The issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It has been whether they fired their main guns.  You did not merely claim that tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress sniper fire and that they were \\\"quite\\\" effective at this.  You continue to back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is disputing.  Awesley went on:   I   spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was   down and they don't have a card catalog.  Anyway, it took about 10   minutes to find this in _Nightmare in Detroit, A Rebellion and It's   Victims_ by Sauter and Hines, on page 133, telling of the death of   Tonia Blanding, age 4.             \\\"When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction   the shots came from. [...] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the   tank belched fire into the buildings.  After a short round into the front   of the buildings, the tank guns spit again, tearing apart huge holes out   of the side of the apartment.\\\"           Well, it's not the main gun.    \\\"Well, it's not the main gun.\\\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you now going to admit that you were wrong?    will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main   guns?  Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will I read   the reports of the tank fire?  I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won't.    It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard   sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American   cities in the Sixties.  Awesley replied:     Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to   find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main   guns.  I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67 riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have been *big* news.  Awesley goes on:   You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since it makes your other claim seem more plausible.  And on:   I don't   expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and actually   do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know   what you find.  I already know what you found: nothing.  If I claimed that the Marines used F-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton, New Jersey would you believe me?  Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research it?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in?  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about it.

The war on drugs has failed, but in my opinion, that doesn't mean we have to give up.  Only change the tactics.  For instance, here are how some penalties should be changed.  Dealing Coke -- Death Dealing Heroin -- Death Dealing Pot -- Death Dealing Crack -- Death  The list goes on and on!!!......  JUST KIDDING!!!  However, on a more serious note, I do believe that we should take some money  away from the foriegn operations in South America and costly border  interdiction efforts.  (Don't think I'm going to say, \\\"spend it to educate  people\\\", because I know plenty of educated dopers).  Actually, spend it on   things like drug treatment programs.  I saw an interesting story on 60 minutes about how the British actually  prescribe and addict his \\\"recommended\\\" dosage, and try to ween him off from it, or cut the amount down to levels where it is \\\"acceptable\\\".  Sounds good so far  from what I heard with a decrease in cost, lower addiction rates by wiping out  the dealer's markets, etc. (But that was the only thing I have heard about it.)  However, legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be  bought like cigarettes is just plain silly.  Plus, I have never heard of a  recommended dosage for drugs like crack, ecstasy, chrystal meth and LSD. The 60 Minute Report said it worked with \\\"cocaine\\\" cigarettes, pot and heroin.\",\"[stuff deleted...]  That's like saying that, since mathematics includes no instructions on how to act, it is evil.  Atheism is not a moral system, so why should it speak of instructions on how to act?  *Atheism is simply lack of belief in God*.    Plenty of theists  I think the argument that a particular theist system causes genocide can be made more convincingly than an argument that atheism causes genocide. This is because theist systems contain instructions on how to act, and one or more of these can be shown to cause genocide.  However, since the atheist set of instructions is the null set, how can you show that atheism causes genocide? -- David Choweller (davec@silicon.csci.csusb.edu)  There are scores of thousands of human insects who are ready at a moment's notice to reveal the Will of God on every possible subject.          --George Bernard Shaw.\",\"Environment:  X11R4  Motif 1.1.4  Sun IPC 4.1.3  Problem:  When mouse is moved across screen horizontally, the sprite goes off  of the edge of the screen and reappears at the *other* edge.

There are a staggering number of victims in the world and more each day.  I think on balance, intervention would create more victims, including American ones.  Since the first responsibility of the US government is to protect Americans, I think they serve that role best by staying away from Bosnia and other regional conflicts.   Of course not.  The Jews were not trying to carve a territory out of Germany either, and except for small-scale resistance and a few larger uprisings, did not have an army or a government.   I see the pattern of atrocities as a fairly often practiced tactic of a colonizing power - driving away and/or eliminating the population of an area they want to control.  The US tried basically that in Vietnam, the Iraqis in Kuwait, the Israelis in Palestine, South Africa, etc, etc, etc.  It sucks, it's ugly, and it's saddening.  But it is not genocide.  It is not my impression that the Serbs want to eliminate every Muslim in Yugoslavia.  I still say the Bosnians are getting their asses kicked; they should surrender and evacuate the areas they can't hold.   I am a staunch Republican, BTW.  The irony of arguing against military intervention with arguments based on Vietnam has not escaped me.  I was opposed to US intervention in Somalia for the same reasons, although clearly it was not nearly as risky.   Well, one thing you have to remember is, the press likes a good story.   Good for business, don't you know.  And BTW, not \\\"everyone\\\" wants to help the side that is less like us.  I never said the two sides were morally equivalent, I said neither one is innocent.  There are just too many good reasons to stay away:  1) The Europeans are perfectly able to deal with this dispute on their borders    in any way we do it.  Put another way, we have no assistance to offer the    Europeans which they do not already possess themselves.  It is not good to    promote the idea in anyone's mind that the United States is responsible    for cleaning up every bloody mess in the world.  2) Clinton is not the man to lead this country into a military adventure.

When it comes to local dealers:  - Have fun getting consistently good support.  Most of their \\\"techs\\\" are re-treaded salesmen, not trained technicians, with a high turnover rate.  - Have fun getting in-warranty work done quickly and courteously.  - Have fun getting out-of-warranty work done cheaply, or even done period, unless you are on a paid service contract.  Having been both a service technician, and a service manager, at a ComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place, I know what I'm talking about.   I also know the \\\"local service\\\" scam that retail computer dealers like to push when they're selling.  It's that same old song that car dealers having been singing for years -- \\\"Buy from me and you'll get good service. We always treat our customers right!  Buy from my competition and you'll be sorry if you need service.\\\"   Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order companies that give excellent service, including overnight replacement parts,  on-site calls, etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give you good service, too.

It seems to work equally well for CFS, another hint that these may be different facets of the same underlying process.     Yes.  The benefit is usually evident within a few days of starting it. Most of the patients for whom it has worked well continued low-dose amitriptyline, daily aerobic excersise, and a regular sleep schedule (current standard therapy).  Because of the cost (usually > $150/mo., depending on dose) and potential for significant side effects like corneal injury and birth defects, I currently reserve it for those who fail conventional treatment.  It is important that the person prescribing it have some experience with it and follow the patient closely.     As far as I know, I am the only person looking at it currently.

For those of you who haven't worked with pieced image files, here is how to put it back together.  1. save the 14 parts to 14 individual files  2. use a text editor to remove the header and footer     in each file.  3. concatinate all the parts into a single file  4. uudecode the file There are tools available to do this without the hassle such as uuconvert (UNIX) and UUcoder (Windows).

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the bottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the 46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have large, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get them :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the waist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece size that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's problems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and when I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).  I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are in some way different from us real folks.  Also, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands. I've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a store wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom in any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my sidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally leave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall down unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight), stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit), and run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be running errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...  As far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably equal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by 3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around the waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.  So I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit, I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I own.  Wouldn't go long distance without it.

Please send replies directly to umsoroko@ccu.umanitoba.ca \",\"In my postings I have made a proposal for comments and discussion. Those who don't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to do so.  However I would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass in a personal manner, legally responsible for their deeds. I cannot accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect threats.  PS: My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics. It has to do with the search for peace which would enable justice. I don't consider that justice is done, when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967 are not permitted to return to their homeland. This can at best be called pragmatism, a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. It can never be called justice. And peace without justice will never be peace. It is my conviction that the situation in which a state, through the law, attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as Israel does), is not normal. Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than Western democracies, such as the United States, in which Jews are free to marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may have drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just to compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day will come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society, in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic affiliation of its constituency, such a Fund would not be needed any more. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their traditions, why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state. Western democracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that most American Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed Christian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW.  I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional, infantile outbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect Judaism are uncivilized. Such behaviour is not good for Judaism.\",\" Jim, please, that's a lame explanation of the trinity that Jesus provides above. Baptizing people in the name of three things != trinity.

But of course I knew that because it is so easy to do.  There is not a single doubt in my mind that every byte that passes every significant gateway or 'bone is captured for the colligation of data about __________?  (Maybe your name is here).  Maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted  posts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared private key.  For example at the coming up Cypherpunks meeting, a private key corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out by a moderator.  Minutes, followup comments to other participants, and so on could be posted to the alt.encrypted group for the use of the people who attended. Communiques intended by the group for non-attendees could of course just be signed using the private key but otherwises not encrypted.  Starting a alt.encrypted newsgroup rather than just maintaining mailing lists is better for several reasons.  First, it would be easier to archive for people who might join a group \\\"late\\\" and who might like to easily read earlier posts; second, traffic analysis to know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled; three, a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicize available privacy measures on the internet.  And it would be fun to accumulate a secret keyring full of such keys -- it beats giving out t-shirts as a door prize.  We could send a copy of alt.encrypted directly to Judge William Sessions or Admiral Studeman to save them the time of having it collected for them.  \",\"  not a flame, just a point:  I'd be scared at 130 here, not because i feel drivers who are STUPID.

Everything seems to work fine except for the Windows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit modes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup, and within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally unintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire about this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it was version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I'm simply amazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).  One very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none of the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers for Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I've been running a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have \\\"Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer.\\\"  Anyway, I just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about it.

I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think  the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).  I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version,  improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88)  although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on  Cirrus's part but I don't think so.

This day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy U.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.  The short version is that his testimony was consistent with the opening statements for the prosecution.  Cooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington) on August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation with five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was using night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up into two teams of three people.  The six later met at an observation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies Cooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to scout further possible surveillance sites.  Cooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into a gully to see, \\\"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\\\" Striker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking loudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.  They ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the \\\"fern field\\\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance team had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy target and might be \\\"shot in the back.\\\"  As Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the road from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.  At this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \\\"fend him off with his gun.\\\"  [It is unclear whether this means he clubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then took cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not noticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan got up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \\\"Stop!  U.S. Marshal!\\\"  Harris then \\\"...brought the weapon around at hip level and fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw Bill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\\\"  Cooper fired at Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon to bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then heard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the direction of the shots, yelled, \\\"You son of a bitch!\\\" and ran toward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him from directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the cabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward the cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two fingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and then his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the other three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.  On cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of throwing rocks into the gulley, asking, \\\"You wanted to lure that dog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?\\\"  Nevin also pointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had claimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him. Cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and decided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the cross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at him [no answer was available].  Friday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.  Notes: There was no coverage of protestors.  Drew ============================================================== \",\"  Hmmm, this gave me an interesting idea.  How about this argument:  1)  Second Amendment gives us the right to keep and bear arms.  2)  Strong cryptography is \\\"arms\\\", according to the U.S. government (that's     why it's so hard to export).  Therefore, we have a constituitional right to strong cryptography!   Q.E.D.  However, it's likely to be as hard or harder to exercise this right as it is getting to exercise the other rights that the government is slowly restricting.  Maybe the NRA _would_ be the best existing organization? (Although I think a new one might be better, but perhaps would take too long to start up.  I would certainly join.)\",\" The \\\"so sacred it's secret\\\" explanation is a bit misleading.  While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.   There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).  Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \\\"You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you\\\" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.   But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few:  1. \\\"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given\\\" (Matt. 13:11).  2. \\\"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\\\" (Matt. 19:11).  3. \\\"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\\\" (John 16:12).  4. \\\"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father\\\" (John 16:25).  5. \\\"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\\\" (1 Cor. 3:1-2).  6. \\\"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face\\\" (2 Jn. 1:12).  (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.   Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------          Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City                     jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu\",\".d. .d. I just thought of another one, in the Bible, so it's definately not because of *lack* of religion.  The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for other reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy and peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions  lying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice, peaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to mind...  I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally intended for.  That doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in the Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own stomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to kill by their leaders.  The point is that there are many things involved in religion that often lead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant side effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching between Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.    @Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest parts of Man's history.@  Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological social caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs. The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to further their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these were groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more powerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples because there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over religion that he does not have many choices.

Ham rigs for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet  away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding. If you experience the problem frequently, it may be  caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio  transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire, etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.  If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them). Good instructions are included with the chokes.

I was referring to the fact that far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For much of the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point where long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note that the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh, Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.  \\\"When it's time to railroad, you railroad.\\\"     Not off the top of my head; I'll have to dig out my reference books again. However, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the Navigator's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and merchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be shared.     The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations can even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft), Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in 1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only a gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.   Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions asked. \",\" In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a project.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project.\",\"Hi  I am trying to implement a pointer feature in Xlib  I have multiple windows and all can take input and  show output simultaneously on all other displays  I want to implement a pointer feature   I would like to get the pointer to come up on all windows once  I choose pointer in the menu and every one should be able to see it  Can you give me some hints as to how I should proceed    replies will be greatly appreciated\",\"     Hey, sounds great.

Wait a minute. S&K did NOT compare trends.  If they did, they would have seen that the advent of Canada's gun law had no effect on homicides, total or handgun.  Without a pre- vs. post comparison, one cannot speculate as to the utility of anything.  All they have is a correlation, and correlation DOES NOT prove causality.    Hold it again. You dismiss a point about demographics, then you ask about socio-economic demographics? Very slick.  Once again, correlation does not prove causality.  Looking at pre-vs. post data, the Canadian gun law had no effect.   Sir, if you were a Canadian, and owned a gun before the restrictive gun laws were passed, and decided to hide it rather than turn it in, would you answer truthfully a question about gun ownership from someone who calls, writes, or asks you on the street?

Asante EN/SC adapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the newest drivers from Asante's ftp server.  The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain - specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac tests memory, etc. Just before the \\\"happy Mac face\\\" normally shows up, the power light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the Asante box pretty much unusable.  It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed during the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has *never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had it for over a year).  Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk -- several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator (both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal resistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another identical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages.

The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.  A merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri  town of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to  have taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military  operation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the  Armenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been  massacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten  and shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed  the Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian  insurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the Karabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City  hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant  were killed.

Anybody knows compression-algorithms & -factors for voice ?  I've posted some info on CELP coding on sci.crypt.  Looks like you can squeeze speech into 4000bps if you have a fast enough computer like a sparcstation (or a Newton with the Acorn Risc Machine in it :-) )  This drops the bandwidth to so low a figure that it's feasible to run speech over tcp/ip running on top of slip down a v32bis modem.  Not only will this let us run point to point encrypted speech, it'll let us run speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us by getting *very* heavy about regulations.  The thought of this, if the administration realised, would probably scare them shitless.  Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol for internet speech *damn fast*, allowing anyone who feels brave to inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our workstations.  Shouldn't be too difficult.  The CELP stuff is standardised, we use tcp/ip streams, and a protocol allowing silences to be used to catch up on any net lag, and also to avoid sending any data during silences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end because any net delays would add up to big voice-lags)  As for me, I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone. It'll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night :) (whether encrypted or not)  You know, surely *someone* is working on this.  Who?  It's so obvious, why doesn't it exist already?  I've only seen netphone for Suns and it didn't do the CELP compression so was restricted to ether connections.\",\"        Mr. Parsli, I have to take exception at this.  There are verifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments abusing gun-control restrictions.  I don't think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye future.  After so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the stove.          I'd love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell pork back to their constituents, there's not a lot I can do.           It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust the government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed to do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies total government power.   I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.          This is very likely.          The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many people would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're here.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is necessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should have always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't. Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more magical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more heavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.          No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S., two-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide rates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about half the per-car death rate.         The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  The fct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody, whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent.        Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.        Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even if we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.           In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms. (50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per  se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's countries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got more knives or fists.           In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S. have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms of prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they are doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is  violent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The *vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of 99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that you can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.          The situation is not \\\"good\\\" in that people fear for their lives. But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots, protecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they, too, lost their livelihoods?          The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't. However, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can be appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition won't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.         You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If you're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully simply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough, as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)          45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun. That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans. Firearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the group *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.         You may take that for what it's worth. \",\":  : And, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been traded,  : resigned, or been striped of his title during the season?

Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me, I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.  Very little sugar or salt.  Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)  My \\\"clean your plate\\\" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last 10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch up, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.  I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry shortly, and eating won't be practical then).  I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to stores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car. I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes runs in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle.)  There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately, it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.  Obviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've done will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who did try it and didn't succeed.   I'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat. I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty, my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes off again over a week or two. --  Keith Lynch, kfl@access.digex.com\",\"<MUNCH!>  It would be funny if it wasn't so damn *NASTY*; and as non-xian as I am,  it's hard to believe that someone is pushing black is white and freedom is slavery so blatantly.\",\"[why do babies get diseases, etc.]   Here's the (main) problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably  consistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does not support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by latest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for about 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at most) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before there were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease... mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just fossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what brought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then how could it exist before humans?  [deletions]   Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about biology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off' in perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a collective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the degeneration of the genetic code'.    Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But it still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as much damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even when people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed', (forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and died off for lack of nearby hosts.  I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few hundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to be getting less nasty w/age...    Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right? And, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It seems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift humans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less lethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems, imperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us by God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made our immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases?    Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the phrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect' system would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system that will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a perfect system. At least, IMHO.  Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the original genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart? If so, why could God not have used better materials?  Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself, of did It just choose not to?  [deletions]   My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for the explanation you give. (At least, that I'm aware of.)

FACT SHEET        PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT  The first thing it doesn't say is \\\"We're giving you stronger encryption\\\". what it says is     the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only    provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust    than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of    the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the    escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to    encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization. But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now, so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break! *At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search for the other 40-bit key.  Similarly, it didn't say \\\"We're making encryption is commercially available.\\\" because encryption *is* already commercially available, including forms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA. And phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.  The next thing it didn't say is \\\"We're making encryption legal\\\", because of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the President can't change the First Amendment merely by decree. What it *did* say was:  In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the  private sector from developing, or the government from approving,  other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in  assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system. which clearly means \\\"We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys. Soon.  Once business buys into this.\\\"  Another thing it didn't say is \\\"We're going to ask Congress for money to do *lots* more wiretapping\\\", because of course, there's a budget crisis, and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash. What it *did* say was:    The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to    the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct    lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure    law enforcement communications.

And since the nation is nominally based on the Declaration of Independence which states that \\\"all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness\\\", it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definition of humanity. \",\"      Now doesn't this sound a lot like the \\\"colorful (or otherwise) story       from antiquity that somehow tries to (or does) explain natural pheno-      mena\\\"?

Some reported pincushioning   (the problem I had), others poor focus, etc, etc.  I complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (I dodn't even pay shipping) and returned to me in 2 days.   It's now clear, well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel distortion at all. I'm very happy with it, and the digital controls and mode memory are nice.

I don't have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:  1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have  to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too  ignorant to know I need to buy)  2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in  about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a  motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes a difference)  3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?  4)  In DC, as I imagine it is in every other state (OK, OK, we're not a  state - we're not bitter ;)), you take the written test first and then get a learners permit.  However, I'm wondering how one goes about  learning to ride the bike proficiently enough so as to a) get a liscence and b) not kill oneself.  I don't know anyone with a bike who could  teach me, and the most advice I've heard is either \\\"do you live near a field\\\" or \\\"do you have a friend with a pickup truck\\\", the answers to both of which are NO.  Do I just ride around my neighborhood and hope for  the best?  I kind of live in a residential area but it's not suburbs.

Some say that if the two have : publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and : are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective : qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.  The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically* married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.  e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall leave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh'' (Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).  If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the phraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This implies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the point of intercourse.  Compare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary was pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were *betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which required a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary and Joseph went to bed together.  Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is described as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes  place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with Jesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will take place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse, because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.  In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is not marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the point when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the civil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.) Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a marriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since Napoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be corrected on that point!)  This view obviously raises some questions:  What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering marriage. Are those people also ``married''?  If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours the laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God- honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and also to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)  --   ----- Michael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)\",\"I appreciated the follow-ups and replies to my earlier query.  One reply, which I have lost, suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses, one  of which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan.  By coincidence, last week's _America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles  Bourke, Corpus Christi's pastor emeritus.  Fr. Bourke also directed the NT  translation in the New American Bible.  He noted \\\"...certain practices have  been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality,  and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy.\\\"  I note that at my  parents' parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the  offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word \\\"risen\\\".  This was not a  kiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 Mass.  I wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies.  This newsgroup as a whole offers generally moderate (perhaps because it's moderated) conversation on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself). Sometimes people do go over the top, but the remarkable thing is how that is the exception, I think.  Benefits of the doubt are generally granted.  It seems so...Christian?\",\"We here at Utah State University Cooperative Extension have been using W4Wg for a while now.  We wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway.  You also need a tcp/ip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that's what they require to get the smtp gateway to work.  You need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff.  We do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do.    There is a glitch somewhere in the system though.  I don't know if it is MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to a Unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mail is routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail. Most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha. Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying \\\"Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)\\\".  If you can stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.  The system people of course say that the VAX is not the problem, the gateway is probably the problem.  If anyone wants to get help it is only $175.00 for one support call. (until problem is worked out)  Phooey to that I say.  I am looking vigorously for a better Idea.    If you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew,  please drop me a note - anyone.

Thanks,   Davebo \",\"By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff  At 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer. Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues.  The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3. With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit playing.  They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired.  ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\\\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.  If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry's anger.  ``It wasn't pretty at the end,\\\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but it did.\\\"  Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium.  The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.  The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.  ``It's a shame we let down,\\\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\\\"  Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won, and that's all that matters,\\\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\\\"  Some players didn't have a problem.  ``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\\\" said Rich Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.  ``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\\\"  Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow, he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.  ``I didn't know it was final,\\\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs, and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end.\\\"  The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.  ``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\\\" Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\\\"  If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.  Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then, Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.  With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.  Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.  Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the  rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend.  Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.  ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\\\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and I know he was watching. I know he's happy.\\\"  Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later, making it 5-1.  Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.  Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period.  The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there,\\\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\\\"\",\"Does anybody have informations about the   W 86 C 451   and  W 86 C 456 chips (40pin DIL pckg)?  They are build in a multifunction io-card for pc.

The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \\\"The Abyss.\\\"  Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at  the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation  whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it  was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if  someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There  were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that  large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well  mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an  Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that  they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do  to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded  a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move  over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone  recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina.  It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats.  Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis,  people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the  auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and  gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \\\"OK, we've  scared them enough, let's leave.\\\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to  me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of  \\\"anasha\\\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like  they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing  had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful  films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We  could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine,  and it was dark . . .  Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting,  something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially  listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to  make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation  wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,  policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors  there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some  naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well,  since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super  serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we  live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the  driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and  he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well,  OK . . .  So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was  happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation  was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \\\"Ka-ra-bagh,\\\" they're not going  to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had  come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to  cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma  down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though  nothing had happened.  That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and  didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't guess.  On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda,  Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and  no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that  morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda  Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, \\\"Don't they want Armenians? Well what  are they after, if they're already in that state?\\\" She says, no, nothing like  that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The  cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.  Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy  problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, \\\"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\\\" Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home  and told Mamma. Mamma said, \\\"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on.\\\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I  tell Lyuda, \\\"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see  you out.\\\" Mamma says, \\\"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can  see what the situation in town is.\\\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was  ready. Mamma says, \\\"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\\\" We sat down at the  table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything  out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television, and the show \\\"In Fairy-Tale Land\\\" was coming on.  We cleared the table.  We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't  see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people  . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's  an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story  buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20  people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see  several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not  killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of  the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their  feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in  general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not.  I become terrified and go home and say, \\\"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \\\" Then the crowd  runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and  starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors  are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is  shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it  turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and  kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop  them.  They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the  windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard,  and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't  crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey  Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear  tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous  din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were  shouting Father's name, \\\"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\\\" or something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma  says, \\\"Into the bedroom, quickly!\\\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part  of our dowry; Mamma says, \\\"Hide there, they probably won't come in there,  they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\\\" She says, \\\"We'll tell them  that we live alone here.\\\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in  the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say  that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I  can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak  Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told  her anything or not.  Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, \\\"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened.\\\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \\\"Get out of the apartment, leave.\\\" I  say, \\\"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the  apartment.\\\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, \\\"There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!\\\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts,  commanding them: \\\"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\\\"  And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start  undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there,  in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how  much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The  atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among  themselves who would go first.  Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding.  He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It  seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, \\\"Well, we're done here.\\\" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs  . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the  window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the  windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking  about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong  person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be,  which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they  don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I  humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing  . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.  I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't  know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by  my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings,  something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death  come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What  happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.   I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me  clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember  that I said the same words over and over again: \\\"Mamma, what happened, Mamma,  what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\\\" I can't make  sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all  went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his  courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though  he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he  served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor  brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,  \\\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\\\" How do I know who's who  and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when  they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda  said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going  to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's  hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our  sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding  on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in  there. So they survived.  My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back  up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed  there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put  it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and  knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \\\"I'm not going to let you  in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings  and we'll leave the building.\\\" Lyuda says, \\\"I'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\\\" It was just for a  moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came  back to our place and lay under the bed . . .  I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone  number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he  came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were  simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,  it was hard to breathe . . .  My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our  administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary  passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right  after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a  great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not  only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next,  without stopping. After us.  I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young  Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.  Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in  Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \\\"Run quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\\\" At that moment  three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,  there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything  out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to  scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you  here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of  the soldiers said, \\\"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the  Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\\\" So at that point the  Daghestan police were there.  When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously  injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they  were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda  and me and said, \\\"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't  know what to do with the rest.\\\"  So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My  boss said, \\\"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens.\\\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She  examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait  ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People  called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.  That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself,  \\\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\\\" She looks me over and  says, \\\"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things.\\\" And I think, great, I have to deal  with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this  condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't  have the energy to say, \\\"How could our people possibly be smart enough to  think of something that yours haven't already done?\\\" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her  own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next  morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything  more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,  nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at  them.  I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \\\"Better to ask  your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can  better explain what happened.\\\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw  themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward.  Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me  clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress,  but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up  above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \\\"I can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\\\" I went back to my  ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and  brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I  couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one  had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . .  Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should  be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an  Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must  have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something  else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.  The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,  and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many  troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw  a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought  that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait  after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't  come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.  I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm  me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw  a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each  other and asking, \\\"What happened, what went on?\\\" Two days later they came to  see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed  interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they  could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues  who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,  neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what  happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart  . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came,  not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part  of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I  lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be  from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of  insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful.  There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took  me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were  emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's  friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic.  They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasn't cut.  They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon  appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not  talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \\\"We  demand that Seidov come!\\\" The response was, \\\"It's Seidov who sent us.\\\" Seidov  is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said,  \\\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same  things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you  agitators.\\\" And so on. More of them said, \\\"Have Seidov himself come.\\\" This  went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us  out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because  they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The  smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who  had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a  club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay  to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day  someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie  theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it  was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants  took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in  Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to  mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting  right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only  the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women  were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come  any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered  together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie  theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to  the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and  couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently  they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my  eyes.  Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \\\"Aren't you an  Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\\\" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in  nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs.  So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't  spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered  the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only  the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself,  she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the  building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children.  This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were  already in the city.  They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire  families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't  see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult  now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify  the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard  that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people,  including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3.  They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who  had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were  going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply  savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did  what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that  hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from  the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the  ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and  she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and  beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that  whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and  carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.  I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of  people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a  song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has  that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,  the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They  couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face.  I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had  talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the  Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met  with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint  meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of  those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.  They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were  dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch  me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these  people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan.  The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was  there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't  recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, \\\"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\\\" He turned away  and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina  anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out  anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became  myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people  there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his  name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one  we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \\\"If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his  alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not  responsible for my words.\\\" He said, \\\"What did they do to you, how awful,  myself, I hid an Armenian family.\\\" Then after some time goes by he comes back  again and says something entirely different: \\\"I wasn't at home, my family and  I went to Baku.\\\" I said, \\\"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before.\\\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is  being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me  that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.  What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the  head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an  insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the  same time  I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I can't say.                                                       When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it,  because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it  always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my  face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed,  they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41,  is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ  dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our  building was killed, it was that man.  A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come  over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was  all over, people started making announcements in town saying that  investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now  they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he  himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy  came to the plant and said, \\\"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the  bus station on Saturday at ten.\\\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do  you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent,  probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go,  because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had  killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of  that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that  the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from  I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word  I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an  Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know.  His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from  Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time.  His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani  KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many  photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at  curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this,  the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a  haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he  is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did,  I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment.  At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,  all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, \\\"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like  you.\\\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything  without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when  she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had  all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.  They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that  moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the  faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the  apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and  no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have  anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the  apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the  apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they  know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the  building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis  lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our  apartment.  I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt  when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from  our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \\\"Karina, we  saw all of it, how could it happen?\\\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to  me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been  able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani  woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated  woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two  Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She  came down to the entryway and said, \\\"You'll come in this entryway over my dead body.\\\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some  folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't  even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They  couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani  stopped them.  They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place  they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the  apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that?  Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is  some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed  to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had  come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They  screamed and screamed: \\\"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\\\"  Only they didn't shout \\\"kill,\\\" they shouted \\\"gurun ermianlary.\\\" Gurun  literally means \\\"kill,\\\" or \\\"destroy.\\\"  That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their  kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part  of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . .  A boy said to my mother \\\"Where's the gold?\\\" Mamma said he must have been 12  to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the  Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the  fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where  the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a  little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to  wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were  bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and  Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth,  bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had  shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and  tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having  trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and  started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted  to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by  accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,  \\\"What's happened?\\\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \\\"At least go and  find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or  murdered them, at least bring the corpses.\\\" He went looking for us. At that  moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that  someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out  from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought  she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to  herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from  under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that  way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled  down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it happened in.  And Mamma said, \\\"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting  something or other, and running toward the other building.\\\" It had more or  less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I  tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \\\"Listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how  long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\\\" I don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe  not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \\\"Mamma, what do you need any of that  for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\\\" She says, \\\"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the  night at someone else's.\\\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were  coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He  shouts, \\\"Come back, they're coming!\\\" They didn't have enough time to get a  lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my  knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his  wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to  leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,  they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building,  maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished  building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more  or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.  Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there,  something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even  live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and  mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television.  They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \\\"My  God, what is going on around here? When will this end?\\\" We turned off the  lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who  knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but  they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that  he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his  apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up  at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, \\\"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us.\\\" He went upstairs, and they say, \\\"Aren't you taking anything from this  apartment?\\\" He says, \\\"I don't need anything.\\\" And the women who were standing  in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were  standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the  first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time  to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty  pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really  mad, and he says, \\\"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\\\" They tell him,  \\\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\\\" He ran off in that direction.  Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms,  there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They  just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man,  she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told  me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them,  the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \\\"Where's the girl who was here?\\\" And he became furious. The woman tells him, \\\"She came to . . . \\\" She didn't know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \\\"She came to and went to the basement.\\\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the  whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took  flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been  standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there  to get me. Then one of them said, \\\"There's so much water down there, she  probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in  the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\\\" I didn't know that, and  when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't  just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .  After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really  didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and  started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all.  Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people  who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think  that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but  they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole  brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\\\" That's  all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not  one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were  standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women  that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for  one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,  an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom:  if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed  to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \\\"If you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\\\" So she left. That trick didn't work on them.  Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget  that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,  then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister.  And no one did anything. Anything.

It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.    It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9.

As early as 1934, K. S.  Papazian asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians          'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1]  At that time, he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would actively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World War II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of Turkish population of eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before the outbreak of the Second World War.  In 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted in the 'Hairenik Weekly:'   \\\"The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall   see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations  and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to  the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are  strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race.  On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is  bereft of social sanctities.\\\"[2]  [1] K. S. Papazian, 'Patriotism Perverted,' (Boston, Baikar Press    1934), Preface.

Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.  WE have to take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws and rules only to better their positions within the government.  WE have allowed them to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation has to be changed.  Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact with the Devil himself.  It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are motivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  And having no easy way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more incentive for the agencies to take property.  It's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that Clinton would have the \\\"plumbers\\\" out in force shortly.  Clinton and his henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control.  Anytime a leader believes in that, the leader will use every means possible to retain that control and take more.  WE have to take OUR government back.  Otherwise we will end up living in the equivalent of a high-tech third world dictatorship.

Even if what you say about this local Pittsburgh guy is true, it is not logical or fair to conclude that this is true of all doctors who treat Lyme disease.  By your logic, I could conclude that all of the physicians who consult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits to Lyme patients are doing it for the money, rather than because they believe they are encouraging good medicine.

For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.  Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour).  Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more (although that would be a lousy way to control it).  What I would like to know is:  1: Are the above guesses correct?  2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?    (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm    too fast when I unplug it)  3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier.

The pull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-cold weather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. Locate the fast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a normal idle. If so, locate the diaphram and test it. If you can't apply suction (via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose) with your mouth that will cause the diaphram to retract, then it's bad and should be replaced.\",\" Hi there I'm suffering from Sarcoidosis at present.

However, there are those who use the church to bolster themselves.  This is evident in many letters.  For instance, Paul talks about the \\\"super-apostles\\\" to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11-12), he mentions how people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12), he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will abandon the faith and teach lies (1 Timothy 4:1-3) and that some will search for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 Timothy 4:3-4). Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them (Matthew 24:4-14).  But look at the promise in this last part.  Verse 14:  \\\"And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\\\"  Even today, there are false teachings.  I can name two which I am well familiar with:  the non-need of baptism and the \\\"praying of Jesus into your life for salvation\\\".  Both are taught.  Both are DEAD wrong.  They have been taken out of context from some verses, interpreted from others, and just plain made up.  The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33.  He then commands baptism in Matthew 28:18-20.  The church Jesus founded, though, is alive and well.  It's not being persecuted as much as back then (the laws won't allow it yet), but it is being persecuted.

Belligerence, genocide, back-stabbing,  rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the  Armenian history.

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and  Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses  each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin  June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours  per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.   Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact  Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below.   ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.        ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## #######################################################################               JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon  University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:  1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.

What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith (i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal revelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God  must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would  honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone  who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are  rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient  for them, or because they wish to spurn God.  I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one  holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is  that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with God.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or  revealed that truth.    --  comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\",\" I have the ARRL Handbook for the Radio AMateur, and I'm getting the Solid STate Design for the Radio Amateur.\",\"I have some used, but working, parts available for the original IBM laptop - the PC Convertible.

(One chip, one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks, and that break gives you all messages involving that phone.)     The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you nothing is an improvement, but notice that XORing with (truely random) bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents.  Using + for XOR, SK for the escrowed key, and A and B for two random bit strings, hand SK+A+B, SK+A, and SK+B to three escrow agents.

You're not good at math. But bear with me). A win is worth two points. So, getting two ties is the same as  getting one win. If your team played two games, won one and lost one, you'd have two points. If my team played two games and tied them both, we'd also have two points. We'd be tied in the standings even though our records are different.  Perhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again.

Surely you don't wish for the Democrats to destroy our beloved country just so your party can get some trivial political advantage? That's rather a petty way to think.

I couldn't stand the man, but I wish he'd done a decent job; if so, we might not be in the mess we are now, and that would be a small price to pay for suffering through another term of Republican control. Similarily, YOU should be hoping and praying that Clinton does a good job. Even if you're certain he won't.\",\"Hi !  I am interested in the source of FEAL encryption algorithm.

I do this as a service to the entire baseball world on USENET, especially for those in the East Coast who can't get final scores for West Coast games in their newspapers or late TV newscasts. This is helpful to fans in other countries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week. Also, many have requested for this kind of service previously but it was only available through BBS's or some pay news services. By the way, mine is free of charge and has no copyright restrictions.   Remember I only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the rec.sport.baseball newsgroup. Other than that, everything is done through private e-mail. Currently, there are 986 people on my mailing list that branches off into other mailing lists available for many others. And the list grows by an average of 35 people a day.  If people on USENET really don't want to see the postings I do to rec.sport.baseball on a daily basis, please just let me know. If the response is overwhelming against the posts, I won't do it anymore.   Thanks for your time.

There is a role for short chain fatty acids in patients with colostomies and rectal pouches that are inflammed (Short is butyrate and shorter).  There may be a role for treatment of UC with Short chain fatty acids, and I am looking  forward to the upcoming AGA meeting in Boston to see what people are doing.    You raise a hypothesis about the studies and restriction of other fatty acids.  You should contact the authors directly about that or even write a letter to the editor - it is a good point.

Even though my skin gets oily it really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry.   Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day vitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it   is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease  on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating meat).  Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with oilyness.   Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't be an infection afterwards.  Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).  \",\"Recently the following problem has arrisen.

Marvin Batty.\",\"Here are some ideas for those of you who want to oppose the White House Clipper chip crypto initiative.  I think this is going to be a tough measure to fight, since the Government has invested a lot of resources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They are serious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate Bill 266 in 1991.  Possible actions to take in response:  1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and more.  2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and technology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet, write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or newspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea.  Remember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be slow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and arcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one.   3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your Member of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US Senators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of technology issues.  Talk to those aides.  4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party would certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of the Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a surprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political spectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government that can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play themselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you want to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.  4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming these groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal expenses and lobbying.  5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be lobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a telecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then present your company's management with a united front of engineering talent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your management, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold meetings on it.  6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla techno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP, anonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers, etc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might also be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed by Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful tools for these purposes.   7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on this topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so we may have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't outright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of this Clipper chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared to analyze the Government's plan, and articulate how we want it modified. \",\"       I stand corrected.

God's love  is unconditional, unqualified, unfathomable.  We are capable of  rejecting God's love but He never fails to love us.  These verses do not show that God's love is qualified but rather that He  is opposed to evil.  I am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be  an innappropriate emphasis on Hell.  God deserves our love and worship  because of who He is.  I do not like the idea of frightening people into  accepting Christ.    I see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows God's love with  putting into words and explaining that love.  Preaching the Gospel  without living the Gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a  clanging cymbal.  Here's a question:  How many of you are Christians because you are  afraid of going to Hell?  How many are responding to God's love?\",\"If you are interested in (any of) the following, please contact me:         EMail           mbeck@vtssi.vt.edu         Phone           (703)552-4381         USMail          Michael Beck                         1200 Progress Street #5500E                         Blacksburg, Virginia 24060 ~~~~~~~~~~FOR SALE as of 12AM 4/16/93~~~~~~~~~~   1       PANASONIC AF X8 CCD OmniMovie Camcorder                 VHS HQ                 High Speed Shutter                 Flying Erase Head                 ca. 3 years old, but only used VERY lightly                 Date/Time stamp                 Counter/Memory                 Rec Review                 Fade                 Back Light                 Auto/Manual Focus                 Built in microphone/Jack for external microphone                 Comes with:                         Sturdy aluminum/hardplastic carrying case                                 (20\\\" long X 13\\\" wide X 6\\\" high)                         Shoulder strap                         Power adaptor/battery charger                         Battery pack                         Remote recording controller                         UHF/VHF ---> cable adaptor                         Audio/Video cables and adaptor                 Aproximate dimensions (measured around outmost features)                         15\\\" long X 4\\\" wide X 8\\\" high (w/ handle)                 ASKING PRICE:  $BEST OFFER so far $350, but looking for more                                  ($700 new price)   1       AMIGA 3000UX    25mhz, unix compatible machine w/100 meg Hard                 Drive, 4 meg RAM, no monitor, keyboard (ESC and ~ keys                  broken)                 ASKING PRICE:   $1500 OBO.   1       Hewlett Packard ThinkJet Printer w/ HP-IB interface                  Like NEW in original box                 ASKING PRICE:   $250 OBO.

That's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.  I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I deign from commenting much further.   Now hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as many other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that Christians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily being arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute, but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.    Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably* determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible human beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The  distinction is subtle yet important.  When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results are reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken, without sacrificing his convictions.  Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty. Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered, \\\"Cogito, ergo sum,\\\" yet we have not advanced much beyond that.  Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely certain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course, you have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all practical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with Christianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about absolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability  that they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do)  abandon these absolutes.   As I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does not mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to  render all doubts unreasonable. \",\"Hi...  I need information on scaring.

I asked in these groups some time ago what about the TC++/VE, and got no answers, so I decided to try. My brother who lives in the US bought and sent it to me, and I'm still trying to get used to it.  Before I put my good/bad points list, consider I am a Turbo Pascal/DOS programmer, and sometimes try to make something in Unix with C (just some exercises from university). I used to make some programs in Microsoft C version 5 (!!) because we used some third-party libraries that required that.  - I like Borland. It seems to me much more easier to use than Microsoft,   specially the debugger. I tried to learn Codeview sometimes, but never   felt confortable with it. - TC++ V/E seems very nice to create simple apps, like the examples on the   ObjectWindows book. So far, no problems. Lets see next week or so, when I   will try something more complex. - It works nice even in my \\\"weak\\\" machine 386/16Mhz, 6 Mb Ram.   But.....  - The manual for the Resource Workshop seems to be from a different version    from the Workshop itself. Some of the windows that appear on the manual   have more itens than in the manual. - I think I will run into trouble since I got this TC++/VE from my brother   as a present. I didnt wanted to buy the Japanese version because 1) I    suspect that the manuals will be in Japanese :-( and 2) I believe it   will be far more expensive here. So he bought it as a present and sent to   me, I send the registration card to the Japanese branch of Borland, but...   who knows.  So, I'd like to ask some questions for you all;  - I know that there are some Microsoft guys around here in this group. Is   there anybody from Borland ? Is there any e-mail address that we can    contact the technical support ? Not for stupid questions, but to ask   for example, why the RW manual seems to be different from the RW itself ? - Is there anybody else using it around here ? - Will the book of Petzold be useful for me ? I intend to use RW and ProtoGen   to make the interfaces and then work on the code itself.   Answers to my e-mail or comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools, please.

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call Japan, etc.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would greatly appreciate your sending it to me.

Hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.  De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er staat echter meer op stapel.  Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten 'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!  Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.  Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900.

As published in \\\"US Industrial Outlook 1993\\\"  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be \\\"adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.\\\"                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  \\\"Space Business Indicators\\\" in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year  through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request \\\"launch on demand\\\"  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/\\\"Spacelifter\\\" program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all \\\"ELV upgrade\\\" programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \\\"Spacelifter\\\"  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \\\"GO-AHEAD\\\"    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a \\\"Star Wars\\\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \\\"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\\\"     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst's report Morgan Stanley said \\\"We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.\\\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \\\"Aerokosmos\\\"  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \\\"Severkosmos\\\",  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one's a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \\\"the main  alternative rocket supplier\\\" for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of \\\"off the shelf\\\" components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the  satellite's communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \\\"Asiasat- 2\\\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based \\\"Asiasat\\\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's  aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \\\"made in Korea.\\\"   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

Around a million Americans every year defend themselves with firearms.  In many of these cases the defender doesn't even have to fire a shot!  The mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the deterrent that is needed.  I don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  But, taking away the right of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent crime problem in this country.  If honest, law-abiding citizens are unable to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will be able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling guns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns should be banned by the Klintonistas.   Statistics, por favor?   See my previous post.  That ought to set you straight.   People have the right to keep and bear arms no matter what the Constitution says.  That means that even if the 2nd Amendment is repealed the *people* (that's all American citizens FYI) will *still* have the right to keep and bear arms.

I was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs.       We here are *VERY* interested in info on R12 substitutes (in fact I  think we really need all the info on this we can get).      I would really appreciate technical, supply, and hardware-upgrade  details.       Also, R12 is a useful solvent/reagent in the extraction/production of  certain pharmaceuticals.  Any info on the substitutes' corresponding  usefullness?      I am currently working with the local engineers who are making sure  we are compliant with the regulations.  The trouble with regulations is  that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do, not what  you should do instead.       I think the cause of the new regulations is the Montreal Protocol  which has a definite CFC-phase-out schedule.  (Of course the cause of  the Montreal Protocol was all the research done on the causes of the  Ozone Depletion Problem.)       Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast  to ban the ozone-depleting (CFC) chemicals and not gasolines and other  greenhouse-gas-producing compounds.  The greenhouse effect (produced by  infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem  (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same  thing.  It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's  (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which  are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms.  Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help  the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem.   Fred W.

My system only had a IDE cable for one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors on it, and consequently have to switch cables.

But for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug in the cable to align these.   Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.

There are lots of them!\",\" I am told that Planned Parenthood/SIECUS-style \\\"values-free\\\" methods, that teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make \\\"choices\\\", actually _increase_ pregnancy rates. I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in \\\"contraceptive technology\\\" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.    Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't we teach \\\"safe drug use\\\" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it because we know that a class in \\\"how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs\\\" would increase drug use?  Why isn't \\\"drug abstinence education\\\" barred from schools because it teaches \\\"religion\\\"?  Aren't we abandoning those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe use?  \",\"What do I need to do to be able to run an NEC 3FGx in 800x 600 mode on my IIci?

Source: 'The Times,' 3 March 1992  MASSACRE UNCOVERED....  By ANATOL LIEVEN,  More than sixty bodies, including those of women and children, have  been spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh, confirming claims  that Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees. Hundreds are missing.  Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley  and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's  massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees.  From that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of  Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters  of Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their  own lines.  We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last  troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out.  They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov,  who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, flew to Stepanakert  to ease their departure.  A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their  dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the  same, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian  positions.  In all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another  31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures  do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed  the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night. The figures also  do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies  Zahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200  people shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came  by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and  of leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies  we saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents.  The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre.  All are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly  clothing of workers.  Of the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national  volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians,  including eight women and three small children. TWO GROUPS,  APPARENTLY FAMILIES, HAD FALLEN TOGETHER, THE CHILDREN CRADLED  IN THE WOMEN'S ARMS.

In this configuration, X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.     The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables.     Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?\",\"Can anyone tell me where to find a MPEG viewer (either DOS or Windows).

They are the depth that the dynasties had to win Stanley Cups.  They tend to be the very good second line guys- who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the NHL. They were all important to their clubs.  Probably, several of these Stanley Cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it were not for the depth provided by these players.  They compare to Rick Tocchet and Ron Francis of the Penguins.  Very good players who can lead lesser teams (Francis-Hartford, Tocchet-Philly) who provide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL.  As a defensive forward, there have been none better than Bob Gainey.  That doesn't mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the Canadians had at that time, but he was excellent at what he did.  Gainey could dominate games with his defence.  He didn't need to get goals to dominate. He shut down the opposition and was thus valuable.  There has never been anyone any better at doing this.

One might find oneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term that require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting a few weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with preferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.  2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects beside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to \\\"sell now and save on taxes.\\\"  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar advice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986), but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates (without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).  It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal economic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless pulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describe accurately what happens in the real world.  \",\"------------- cut here ----------------- University of Arizona Tucson, Arizona                                   Suggested Reading  Tan SL, Royston P, Campbell S, Jacobs HS, Betts J, Mason B, Edwards RG (1992).

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits  for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.   The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed  unsafe under federal air quality laws.        \\\"People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to  exacerbate that inflammation,\\\" said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental  Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  \\\"When people are on  the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over  the edge.\\\"       The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits  with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter  of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because  they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of  compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10  exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.        In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at  levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30  microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with  asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.        The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory  Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung  Association's medical section.        The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that  particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study  by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles  may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.   Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms  and bronchitis in children.        \\\"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\\\"  says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"But more and more research is showing that particles are  bad actors as well.\\\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate  air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated  pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex  and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  acid aerosols.        \\\"Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects  of particulate air pollution,\\\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"We have no way of  duplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \\\" Consequently, most of what  is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research  like the Seattle study.        Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur  dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any  time soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with  asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.      \\\"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only  cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's  rarely particulate matter,\\\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \\\"However, PM10 doesn't have  to be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\\\"                                HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993                 NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma  The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on  Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in  dermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance  techniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care  professionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological  characteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management,  and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi  and their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in  preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days of  presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel  weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement.    Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a  distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins;  (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential  for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical  excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and  extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4)  patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high  risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely;  (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for  melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education  and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality  from melanoma.

Within the program, there are four types  of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily  in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on  clinical research; \\\"comprehensive\\\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a  multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community  outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer  prevention and control research.    Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was  the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new  cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage  of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened  the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and  cancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew  progressively.    In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today,  there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria  for comprehensive status.    To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an  institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly  established in 1990, the eight criteria for \\\"comprehensiveness\\\" include the  requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in  several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong  program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings  into clinical practice.    Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly  beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also  referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting  the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass  strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials,  significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important  outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of  sources.    The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and  capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit  important new findings or address timely research questions.

These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers  engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators  and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications  from new discoveries in the laboratory.    Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and  clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently  incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their  overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today.    Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely  structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and  control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health  departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention  and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions  responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.   Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with  institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community  hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.    Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward  creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through  interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the  laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

The  decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to  test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of  Health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and   Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the  therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies  including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH  that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is  intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the   replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's  reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the  MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.   \\\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the  next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\\\" said Shalala.    Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine  Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had  convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested  simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of  multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two  years.  ==================================================================       HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  \\\"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV\\\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol.  114, No. 14, P. 18        AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was  approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome,  the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the  drug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that  although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk  of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit   disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of  the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the  drug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S.  researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials,  many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients  experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of   AIDS symptoms.

As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye  stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population  there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately,  the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass  graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed  what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.  The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of  oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot  officials and their violation of the co-founder status of  the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat  engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution  to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked  Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and  only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues  consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories  to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply  was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at  all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which  was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece.  Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish  population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population.  The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded Greeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their  autonomy in a separate republic.  Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would rather not be involved with the island. But, given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights, liberties and their very lives.

In case of the Earth z is about 23.5 degrees, I think. I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus, z is almost 90 degrees.  u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured. Paris is at about 45 degrees.  North pole is at 90.  a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from 0 to 360 degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun. The spring equinox occurs at a=0.  L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day). On the equator (u=0) L is always 1/2.  Near the north pole (u=90 degrees) L is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.  Computation: Define the auxiliary angles p and q by: sin p = sin a sin z cos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       (0 < q < 180 degrees)  Conclusion: L = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees) L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)  Wait!  But what is h? The cutoff function h is defined as follows:  h (s) = s    if  |s| < 1       = 1    if   s > 1       = -1   if   s < 1  As an interesting exercise, plot L versus a.   The graph will shows how the length of the daylight varies with the time of the year. Experiment with various choices of latitudes and tilt angles. Compare the behavior of the function at locations above and below the arctic circle. \",\"x>> x>>>> Fake convertible roofs and vinyl roofs. x>>>> Any gold trim. x > x>>>     These, I will agree, are abominations, right along with the fake x>>>continental spare-tire kit -- it's sad watching those little old ladies x>>>try to load their groceries into the trunk with that huge tire-medallion x>>>in the way. x>>>     Most pitiful fake convertible top: on a \\\"Cadillac\\\" Cimarron, with x>>>all the chrome door trim still visible -- not fooling *anyone*. x>>>Of course, there was that Hyundai Excel I once saw... x>> Least you think bad taste is something new: Back in the early 1970s I saw a couple of cars with *flocked* paint jobs.

For example, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a \\\"safe\\\" mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.    For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments \\\"turned off\\\" rather than just \\\"safed\\\".  Was it political (i.e. as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....    I've heard the argument that an active but \\\"uncontrolled\\\" spacecraft causes \\\"radio noise.\\\"  I find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed \\\"safe\\\" mode. This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a (week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth. At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be prepared if necessary.    As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it, great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal. By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.  I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit, exiting the solar system, etc).     Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby, etc) should consider designing in a \\\"pause\\\" mode in case their spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could have some kind of routine written in for the post mission \\\"drift\\\" phase.

COMPLETE:  I am thinking of a simple but fast molecular graphics program to write on PC or clones. (ball-and-stick type)  Reasons: programs that I've seen are far too slow for this purpose.  Platform: 386/486 class machine.    800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 VGA graphics   (speed is important, 16-color for non-rendering    purpose is enough; may stay at 800x600 for    speed reason.)          (hope the code would be generic enough for different SVGA           cards.  My own card is based on Trident 8900c, not VESA?)  What I'm looking for? 1) fast, very fast routines to draw lines/circles/simple-shapes    on above-mentioned SVGA resolutions.    Presumably in assembly languagine.  Yes, VERY FAST please. 2) related codes to help rotating/zooming/animating the drawings on screen.    Drawings for beginning, would be lines, circles mainly, think of    text, else later.    (you know, the way molecular graphics rotates, zooms a molecule) 2) and any other codes (preferentially in C) that can help the     project.

This week's MacWeek reports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August.  My guess is that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the price structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.  Your price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed for mine last month.  I would have rather waited for one of the new machines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of my IIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced me to purchase now.  I'm happy with the machine and won't feel betrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $1000 next week (heh).  Bottome line:  If the C650 does what you want, buy it.  If you wait until the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as well wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and then the units which follow them.  You may save some money but you've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the computer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuous state of flux.  At least they aren't going to try raising them again (grin).\",\"   Other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such..    Why not??

As Roger Lustig pointed out in a previous response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on a constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla, on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.  If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a different story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to hire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is an admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets game at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from baseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion, that's downright ludicrous.

As soon as you possibly can.  The difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally, any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  The remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from a wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (Occupational Safety and Health Service): \\\"Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and Rehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide\\\".  First, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands): (note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)    RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries   OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI   CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI   WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI   CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)   Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.   Pronation: Turning the palm down.   Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.   Supination: Turning the palm up.   Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.   Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.   Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.   Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.   Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.   Abduction: Moving away from the body.   Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.  Now then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse conditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles, tendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt. Diffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle discomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily \\\"the problem.\\\"  --- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory.  Normally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict the blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power, you're completely restricting your blood flow.  Without fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out, then they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates nasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.  Once one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the load.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow, and the cycle continues.  Another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves.  They need blood too.  Anyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor ergonomics, only make things worse.  --- Specific injuries you may have heard of:  (note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute injuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)  Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to cause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability to lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets inflamed, and you've got your problem.  Tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating, and can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more swelling, and more pain.  \\\"Sub-acute\\\" tendonitis is more common, which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse with repetitive activity.  Carpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include feeling \\\"pins and needles\\\", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation. CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.  Adverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere. AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS  disorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy  (brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).  Others: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for a way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS conditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you may have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).  ==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment  The most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax. If you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out the world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work: every three minutes take a three second break. EVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every three minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings, calm down, and relax.  If you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and relaxation are really a big deal.  There are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce inflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen your muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold contrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's best for you.  --- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was written in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from Appendix 10. -- dwallach]  . Let your shoulders relax. . Let your elbows swing free. . Keep your wrists straight. . Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward. . Keep the hollow in the base of your spine. . Try leaning back in the chair. . Don't slouch or slump forward. . Alter your posture from time to time. . Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.  Set the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There  should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees, and your thighs should not slope too much.  Now, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest.  Now, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in the hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area.  If you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning back, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.  [Now, I diverge a little from the text]  A good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, go find a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle, back height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in the way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good store and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you. In the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend \\\"Just Chairs.\\\"  The name says it all.  --- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:  There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some people, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you shouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your keyboard to be \\\"right there\\\".  If you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid pronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads may or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and look at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It's often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands.  Some argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today. Check out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.  ==5== Requests for more info  Clearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive is incomplete.  There's always more information out there.  If you'd like to submit something, please send me mail, and I'll gladly throw it in.  If you'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be wonderful!  I'd love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I'd love somebody to make a list of doctors.  I'd love somebody to edit the above sections, looking for places where I've obviously goofed.  ==6== References  I completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderful guide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health Service, a service of their Department of Labour.

Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView. I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage() is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the Sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that: (1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or (2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is, what is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to a window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is running on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck with XPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)?  All help appreciated...thanks!

Too damn many engineers doing way too little engineering.  \\\"He who sits on his arse sits on his fortune\\\"  - Sir Richard Francis Burton\",\"I'll contact you offline about this.\",\"    So I should be very comfortable that 500,000,000 people want to convert me to Islam. Or, to convert me to ANYTHING.   There are many types of violence, physical murder is only one.  'Trying' to convert is an insult. It's like trying to tell me that me and/or my God/my lack of God are just crap, that I need a new, 'converted' one.  This does not apply for muslims only, of course. Same for jews and for some friendly, nicely dressed neighbours who show on sunday with empty speaches and cheap booklets about some church ....  And when the objective is (I think, however that you are wrong) to convert  everybody, it's just a matter of time when violence will occur.   Aren't we able to learn anything from thouthands of years of 'conversion related violence' ?   Why not let 'the other, more inferiour' people live as they wish and take care  your business?. You do assume that they are inferiour (or their beliefs are) as long as you want to change their thinking.  \",\"  I think you are vastly oversimplifying things. We know that early Christians suffered totures because of their witness to Christ.  For example:  ACT 5:40    His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had             them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of             Jesus, and let them go.  ACT 5:41    The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been             counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.  It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion to even hearing Jesus's name. ACT 5:28    \\\"We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,\\\" he said.             \\\"Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are             determined to make us guilty of this man's blood.\\\"  Finally, the first apostle's death, James of Zebedee was certainly not by Rome's hand any more than the first martyr Stephen.     The problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection, then one must believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what He stood for and preached during His ministry on Earth.  That would have been extremely difficult for some people, especially those that had plotted to kill Him.   \",\"From:  Kayhan Havai # 1026 --------------------------                                                o Dr. Namaki,  deputy minister of health stated that infant   mortality (under one year old) in Iran went down from 120    per  thousand before the revolution to 33 per thousand at   the end of 1371 (last month).      o Dr Namaki also stated that before the revolution only   254f children received vaccinations to protect them   from various deseases but this figure reached 93at   the end of 1371.      o Dr. Malekzadeh, the minister of health mentioned that   the population growth rate in Iran at the end of 1371   went below 2.7     o During the visit of Mahathir Mohammad, the prime minister   of Malaysia, to Iran, agreements for cooperation in the   areas of industry, trade, education and tourism were   signed.

Some of the specific cultural interference to which I refer includes linguistic manipulation, for instance, their Tzotzil-Spanish dictionary removed both Spanish and Tzotzil words for concepts which are threatening to the ruling ideology, e.g., class, conquer, exploitation, repression, revolution, and described words which can express ideological concepts in examples like \\\"Boss--the boss is good.

One of the chapters in Palmer and Thorn's 'Hidden Game' is titled 'Pitching is 44% of Baseball,' implying that fielding is 6%.  How do they determine that?

One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning, with the split probably somewhere around 49.5% and 0.5%. --\",\"   Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The    telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule today.     But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the    judge so ordered.

Hmm, my first thought was that they're using Diffie-Hellman exponential session key exchange, or an equivalent.  However, the Diffie-Hellman patent, like the Hellman-Merkle one on public key systems, claims all equivalents, so the basic point stands.  Interestingly, a quote from Jim Bidzos showed up in the media real soon after the announcement, and he sounded very pissed.  Maybe he hadn't yet realized that PKP might have just struck gold?

What I found interesting about Conklin's letter is the  6 cases he has won against the IRS.  Now, assuming that these cases really exist and were one by him (anyone checked?) they may have nothing to do with his major tax claim.  The IRS fought one of his deductions.

Here's some information about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have some money available...  John Spencer, 1993/04/21  Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21, (21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;       1993 May 1-2          A-ring ingress  18:27                egress   19:30         B-ring ingress  19:51                egress   21:42         C-ring egress   23:00         Saturn ingress  23:59                egress   10:02         B-ring ingress  10:28                egress   12:19         A-ring ingress  12:40                egress   13:43       1993 July 20-21          Saturn ingress  21:16                egress   05:08         A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)                egress   09:38  Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris, and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus' orbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from Iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my attention.  THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?     To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July   disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,   etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,   except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3   airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with   a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something   to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.    Jay  and again:    please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet   disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would   be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and   getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a   good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't   think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are   well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One   possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.  jay\",\"  Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by sentence.   1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.  Origins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?  2) Science cannot explain origins.  This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends on what origins we are talking about.  3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science.  Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \\\"higher truth\\\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \\\"higher\\\" or  \\\"lower\\\"; they are simply true.  More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the scope of discussion.  4) This is a false premise.  If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.  5) By the way, I enjoy science.  On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read. However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy, perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.  6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.  Let us not quibble; count this one as true.  7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]  Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification:  \\\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\\\"  -----  It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.\",\" [Prof. Denning's description of SkipJack mostly omitted]   CHIP STRUCTURE  The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption  algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared  with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16  for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is  16 Mbits a second. [...]   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips  N, a 30-bit serial number  U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted    with the chip  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then  fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:        E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and      E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    Three questions: 1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output:   E[M;K] = 64 bits   E[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits   E[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits    Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,    or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?       All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications    like cellular phones (or even regular phones over   2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?    Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,    or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only    transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into    everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?  3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself?    Does the block have to be present at all?    Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,    it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's     limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,    and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness    (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets    it recognize a valid E[K;U].)        In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT    wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?    (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.)    Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;    paranoid people can use someone else's serial number.     On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,    presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,    like use message encryption that's really E[M; K,U,N] ?

Thanks, Jason\",\"  All your article reflects is your abundant ignorance. The people of  Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never  abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally  hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole  perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July  15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop  Makarios.  Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with  the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right  given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently  and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For  those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island  since 1571.   The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct.               THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM  2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus  It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum.  AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS  The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed...  The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.  Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event.  \\\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying, in  Greek, \\\"You want Taksim eh!\\\"  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.  When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered.  In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying \\\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\\\"  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed.  An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded.  We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.  There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter.  After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport.  All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me.\\\"  ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER  We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days.  We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights.  In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner.  In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother.  In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head.  This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.  Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.  In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16  wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.    DAILY TELEGRAPH (London)    GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE   Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the  Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found  crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were  brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three   more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could  not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to   locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.

The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.    Contents:  * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key? * What references can I start with to learn cryptology? * How does one go about cryptanalysis? * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance? * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem? * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice? * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?   * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?    The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted   acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A   by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone   who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.    A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so   that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is   the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art   of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when   you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both   cryptography and cryptanalysis.    The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is   called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert   plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert   ciphertext into plaintext.    A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The   algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,   Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different   values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.    The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are   called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,   eavesdroppers, or third parties.  * What references can I start with to learn cryptology?    For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given   in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,   concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,   these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has   developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and   mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is   encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up   to the mid-60's.    Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or   Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want   to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common   mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.    The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of   many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently   several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The   book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range   of security including encryption algorithms, database security,   access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments   apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].    The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite   technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in   the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of   DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses   of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on   modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management   and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and   networks.    The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on   the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.  * How does one go about cryptanalysis?    Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of   analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern   finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available   textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series   [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for   the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given   systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the   cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still   classified.    Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,   or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare   of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the   most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.  * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?    In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can   find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.    Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding   ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the   plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or   decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.   Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this   brute-force search is impractical.        Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered   practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years   now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with   this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the   mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic   decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel   machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.   Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].    One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a   brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.  * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?    The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key   rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.    A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The   unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of   ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and   if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount   of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is   probably strong.    A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears   random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).        A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A   system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.    If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily   strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.   However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is   strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then   he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring   integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.  * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?    Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical   cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your   ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might   assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is   correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the   rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same   plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus   he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he   doesn't have a chance.    Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,   for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even   chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into   the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed.

Client Software: SunOs 4.1.1, X11R5 Server Hardware: Sun IPC Server Software: SunOs 4.1.1, Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37)  A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers (including MIT X11R5 Xsun, DecWindows, Tektronix X terminal) has no problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users.  I have tried the following things:      1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch        (100444-37).      2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.      3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110).        This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of        menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method), and        screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help, but I        was still able to get the application to hang.  Repeat By:  This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times.  Click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up)  Click and release on a menu item  Repeat until application hangs   Any help would be appreciated.

By the time of commercial release, there will be other manufacturers of 3DO players announced and possibly already tooling up production.  Chip sets will be in full production.

Why is your criticism ALWAYS directed against Israel, but never against the Arab states, even when they are so much more guilty of the accusations you make?  Is it because you now call yourself a Palestinean?    This is why the \\\"land-for-peace\\\" formula is so foolish.  Land-for-land or peace-for-peace seems much more just, except that it would cost the Arabs something and so is not under consideration.    Let's not forget that about half of Israel's population are refugees from Arab countries.  Somehow, THEIR land now being occupied by Arab states and THEIR homes now being lived-in by Arab people are not included in any negotiations.  Is this your prescription for peace?    Again, you've somehow managed to overlook the fact that the Arab states are much more restrictive on these points.  In fact, the officially Judenrein policies of almost all of the Arab states makes them resemble Nazi Germany chillingly closely.   There are many states in which Christians can live happily, many which have official religions and Christian majorities and Christian-based laws.  There are some 2 dozen Arab and Islamic states.  There is only 1 (one) Jewish state.  Do you have a problem with this?  Is this one Jewish state too many?  There are others who might agree with you, you know.    Have you just arrived on tpm recently???  Again, the supporters of the Arab and Islamic camps are frequently and massively guilty of \\\"emotional, infantile outbursts\\\" which have weakened their positions dramatically.

This FAQ includes information on a number of \\\"gotchas\\\" that can bite  you on particular system. However, the best source of general information on  building the X11 release is found in the Release Notes. The file is bundled  separately from the rest of the release, so if it's become separated from your  sources you can FTP another copy separately: the file RELNOTES.[ms,PS,TXT] at  the top of the distribution. The file RELNOTES is also available from the  xstuff mail server.  In addition, O'Reilly & Associates's Volume 8 on X Administration includes information on configuring and building X.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  94)  Why doesn't my Sun with a cg6 work with R5?   Apparently gcc is the problem; it seems to produce fine code for all Sun displays except for the cgsix.

You may want to  surround it with \\\"-Bstatic -ldl -Bdynamic\\\" if you add it to the EXTRA_LIBRARIES variable, since \\\"syslibs\\\" get added after EXTRA_LIBRARIES on the eventual  compilation command; otherwise you may not have a shared libdl.

In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts with the way X11R4 builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols to be undefined when building some X11 clients:   _get_wmShellWidgetClass  _get_applicationShellWidgetClass Compiling \\\"-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic\\\" appears to work.   To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please  contact your local Sun office and request the following patches:  Patch i.d.

The patch is on export in [1/93]  contrib/X11R4_sunos4.1.2_patch_version3.Z  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  97)  Why can't gcc compile X11R4 on my SPARC? I used gcc to compile the whole distribution, but I get several segmentation faults when running X.   Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the 680x0 or VAX platforms.   Here is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing  structures as arguments and returning them as function values, so when  gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or  return structs, run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and  the server.   This is from the GCC manual:   On the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for   structures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument  list, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by   reference.   This really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet  supported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.   The convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and  `-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.  You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with  compilation flags.     Files which need to be compiled using cc include:   server/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c    rgb/rgb.c   In addition, several of the \\\"inet_\\\" functions use structs as args or return values:     clients/xhost/xhost.c    clients/xauth/gethost.c.  Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly  harmless as they don't involve structs.

When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error   \\\"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket.   Fatal server bug! no screens found.\\\"   Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do  this simple test:   #include <sys/ioctl.h>  SIOCGIFCONF  Run that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of  interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like  whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your  fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc sources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are  identical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make  sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.    [courtesy der Mouse, mouse@LARRY.MCRCIM.MCGILL.EDU; 9/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  99)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 on the older Sun3? In mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found \\\"missing\\\" defines for  CG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be?   The R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add these lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:         #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)         #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN         #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN         #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN   However, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so  references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the  Imakefile.  [11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 100)  What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS 4.1.1? The file <sundev/cg6reg.h> isn't being found.   Sun omitted <sundev/cg6reg.h> from SunOS 4.1.1. Remove the #include  from sunCG6C.c and replace it with the line   #define CG6_VADDR_COLOR   0x70016000 The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied  from another distribution.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 101)  What are these problems using R4 shared libraries on SunOS 4? All of the executables that I try to run have the following results:  ld.so: libXmu.so.4: not found or even:  ld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96c   If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun, remember that you  need to run \\\"ldconfig\\\" as root after installing the shared libraries (if you've installed X on a file-server, run it on the server's clients, too).  While  building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid  linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those  distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have  LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.   If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that  the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or  /usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked  statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]  Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it attempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed. You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to most C compilers).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)  This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in  X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was  removed in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5 libraries only applied to the documented interface).    A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4 or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.

There is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload) running under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using  shared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:  1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used by these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security  problems at your site.  2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).  3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths to the libraries.  [from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]  The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this  may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks.  Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?   On many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits  anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by  accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps more annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console  display. Check the man page for fbtab(5).

Imake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is a makefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro- processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles  suitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not  specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the  configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.  Imake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by which the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration files, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not  obvious.  There have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and R5 versions are different.   You can obtain information on imake from these sources:  - the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on using Imake to build X  - the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information  - on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4 guide to imake.  - the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim Fulton on an early version of Imake  - Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful  explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non- supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu in the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and  config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby.  [7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email; mail a message body of \\\"send imake-stuff help\\\" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.  - see \\\"System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?\\\" by Dinah McNutt in the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.  - German readers should expect in June 1992 an article \\\"Das Meta-Make  / I make, you make / Schwerelos\\\" by Rainer Klute in \\\"iX  Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin\\\", directed at application programmers needing to write Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The X Journal, issue 2:1.  - The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on demystifying Imake.  - Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in  sasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.  [1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 107)  Where can I get imake?   Versions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier  version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits  redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the  template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such  configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the  templates distributed with X11R5.  export contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire distribution.  A stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in ftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?   If you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run \\\"xmkmf\\\". This is a  script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a  Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make,  which will use that new Makefile to compile the program.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines? When I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:  Undefined:  _XShapeQueryExtension  _XShapeCombineMask   These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE) which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular windows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will  only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many  vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case  they will display rectangular windows anyway.   In order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library  libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes will be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do  not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be  compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X  libraries.  [from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 110)  What are these problems with \\\"_XtInherit not found\\\" on the Sun? When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the  error \\\"ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit\\\".   What you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to  get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that  is both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting  _XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby  guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where  XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally be called.   You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal Xt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere.   1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a  connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called XtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your  program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.  2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView  program. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command.    It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically, although this will certainly solve the problem.   [from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be);  11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X? I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under  the current version of X, I get this message:  Undefined:  _XtScrollBarSetThumb  _XtTextSetInsertionPoint  _XtTextReplace   There were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition to the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4 release notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but are part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*. [10/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?   The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the window manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are called \\\"hints\\\" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you can use something like the following:          XWMHints wmhints;         ...         wmhints.flags = InputHint;         wmhints.input = True;         XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)  If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput  resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have source, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.  Certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having  this done.    If you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.  OpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true  [mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?   You can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case.   For most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so  long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in  which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can  sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may  be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order to give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window  manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing; this surely leads to future compatibility problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?    There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the  Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development  under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional  development. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive  application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to \\\"test just  this one little thing\\\" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that  puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4  distributions, and the Xlib \\\"Hello World\\\" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and  R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4  Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x   by Glenn Widener of Tektronix.  [3/90]   In addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute  showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display  connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?   The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:  {  Arg args[3];  int i;  int sensitive;  /* oops; wrong data type */  i=0;  XtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;  XtGetValues(widget, args, i );  ...  }  But XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte;  declaring the variable \\\"sensitive\\\" as Boolean works properly. This problem  comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types  Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar  problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page. [11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?   You're probably trying to use these functions from application code. They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a  parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising  functions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use  only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.  The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources. Although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the  widgets' data becoming corrupted.  [The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be  avoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?   Although there are various details of the current implementation of the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the \\\"new\\\" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves? What should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics are defined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old  widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired  resources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in  creating a new widget.   Note that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B. Lewis      faq%craft@uunet.uu.net    \\\"Just the FAQs, ma'am.\\\" -- Joe Friday \",\"From time to time I have made reference to a book called \\\"The Two Babylons\\\" which is a book written by Alexander Hislop (mid 1800's) about the Babylonian mystery religion and its flight through history.  I was unable to put it down the first time I read it, but others have found it dry.  It has numberable references and illustrations.  If you are interested in purchasing your own copy, you can call Moody Book Store @ (312)329-4352 and order it for $16.99 and they will ship it to you.      It is a good book just to get the reference titles for your own digs into the mystery religions.  I have found it invaluable for that purpose alone.  But for those who only want to skim the subject, it comes highly recommended.     Just a note to my RC brothers and sisters.  You may find this to be a diatribe or you may find it to be a test to the origin and true nature of the origin of RCism.  If you are offended by anything that asks hard questions about your denomination (as to whether or not it is \\\"Christian\\\") then perhaps you should just passover this offer.  To those who are a little more adventurous, go for it and later, please contact me with you reasons pro or con on the scholorship of this book.  I really would be interested.\",\" As I'm sure others will have pointed out to you by now, none of the above measures are required for you *on your own property*.  You do not have to have a license, your car does not have to be registered or inspected, and you do not have to have insurance or safety training classes, when you own and operate that vehicle on your own premises.  If you are going to make use of this dubious analogy, at least make it accurate.  And by the way, in Texas you can drive a car in public (with the proper credentials), but an ordinary civilian can't carry a gun legally in public to save his/her life.  So I won't even consider registration, *manadatory* safety classes, or *manadatory* liability insurance unless I get a federal law repealing all local, state, and federal gun control laws which abridge the Second Amendment, and a non-discretionary federal weapons carry permit, good anywhere in the United States.  Come on, you wanted the analogy.   Mike Ruff\",\"I finally got it back, with great thanks to Mark Spiegel for saving and sending it.    #2 ROB ZETTLER  Season: 4th Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  C/C-  Zettler gave the Sharks every bit he's got this year; unfortunately, this still wasn't enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer, if that.  He works hard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an offensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #3 DAVID WILLIAMS  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, free agent from New Jersey Grade:  C/C-  IMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92, playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and good defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City, was good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that '91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he was prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last year.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #4 JAYSON MORE  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft Grade:  B+  After being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp before '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not particularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then, proceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most reliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash. Offensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73 games), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.  #5 NEIL WILKINSON  Season: 4th Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B-  Wilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However, partially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25 games total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed even when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners; that is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if he can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.  #6 SANDIS OZOLINSH  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft Grade:  I (A)  At the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers), Ozolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury in that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games), but he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points), which, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from their defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still susceptible to so-called \\\"rookie mistakes,\\\" but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back from his injuries, he is ready to be a star.  #19 DOUG ZMOLEK  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B  Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks to play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but after being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points). He was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the team; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to become a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and defensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.\",\" I've gotten migraines after exercise, though for me it seems to be related to exercising without having eaten recently.  \",\"L(>  |JB>  1) Ron...what do YOU consider to be \\\"proper channels\\\"...

Arab governments generally don't care much about the Palestineans and their struggle but find it useful for political purposes back home. They are happy to leave the Palestineans largely under Israeli control because that leaves the job of controlling them to the Israelis.  The Israelis don't like this job any more than King Hussein of Jordan liked it -- and he managed to kill them off at the rate of thousands per month when they started an Intifada in Jordan.  The governments of Syria, Lebanon and Egypt all feel similarly.  However, proclaiming public support for the Palestinean war against Israel deflects criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to even the most brutal Arab tyrants.  Arab *PEOPLE* probably aren't much more sympathetic.  Palestineans have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in Jordan, Lebanon and Kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere.  You might still be right in sympathy to the war against Israel, but I suspect that many Arabs, far removed from the immediate border with Israel (e.g. in Kuwait or Morroco), couldn't care less. \",\"As the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of   late.  It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every   day.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I   can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same   application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application   that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I   need to re-boot.  Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I   first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many   GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows   (with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge   machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into   the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into   the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I   was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother   board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from   SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized   fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.  The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes   rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves   the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't.   I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said   these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire   day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's   in the sppace of 20 minutes?  What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good   diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software   problem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After   Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or   gdi.exe.  Any help is truly appreciated.....  -Eric\",\" Hey, it's better than the status quo.  I am far less worried about \\\"the feds\\\" tapping my phone than high school  scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and  cordless phone calls.  It would be stupid to rely on even a \\\"Clipperized\\\" channel for truly  sensitive material, but it *does* seem to finally offer a reasonable way to  guard against casual eavesdropping.  For example, even with my strong \\\"right  to bear arms\\\" view of the private right to possess and use strong  cryptosystems, the system as described provides enough security that I would  actually buy a cordless phone, and would be much less wary of using cellular  phones, walkie-talkies, and so on.  As long as it's only used for mass-market  voice scrambling, I actually don't see a problem with it.  If you want more security than it offers, use something different.  Use PKCS  for electronic mail, CELP over DES or triple DES with Diffie-Hellman key  exchange for your voice traffic, or whatever.  And yes, I'd rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted, but this is at  least an incrememental improvement for certain applications... \",\"Excerpts from netnews.alt.atheism: 15-Apr-93 Re: thoughts on christians by Dave Fuller@portal.hq.vi  I think it'd help if we got a couple good atheists (or even some good, steadfast agnostics) in some high political offices.  When was the last time we had an (openly) atheist president?  Have we ever?  (I don't actually know; these aren't rhetorical questions.)  How 'bout some Supreme court justices?    One thing that really ticked me off a while ago was an ad for a news program on a local station...The promo said something like \\\"Who are these cults, and why do they prey on the young?\\\"  Ahem.  EVER HEAR OF BAPTISM AT BIRTH?  If that isn't preying on the young, I don't know what is...  I used to be (ack, barf) a Catholic, and was even confirmed...Shortly thereafter I decided it was a load of BS.  My mom, who really insisted that I continue to go to church, felt it was her duty (!) to bring me up as a believer!  That was one of the more presumptuous things I've heard in my life.  I suggested we go talk to the priest, and she agreed.  The priest was amazingly cool about it...He basically said that if I didn't believe it, there was no good in forcing it on me.  Actually, I guess he wasn't amazingly cool about it--His response is what you'd hope for (indeed, expect) from a human being.  I s'pose I just _didn't_ expect it...    I find it absurd that religion exists; Yet, I can also see its usefulness to people.  Facing up to the fact that you're just going to be worm food in a few decades, and that there isn't some cosmic purpose to humanity and the universe, can be pretty difficult for some people.  Having a readily-available, pre-digested solution to this is pretty attractive, if you're either a) gullible enough, b) willing to suspend your reasoning abilities for the piece of mind, or c) have had the stuff rammed down your throat for as long as you can remember.  Religion in general provides a nice patch for some human weaknesses; Organized religion provides a nice way to keep a population under control.    Blech.

X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X  X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that mearly works X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language. X    (see \\\"The New Hacker's Dictionary\\\" by Eric Raymond) X  X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before X    sending any entries.

The typical X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical  X    closing date for contests are in early May. X  X    The contest rules are posted to comp.unix.wizards, comp.lang.c, X    misc.misc, alt.sources and comp.sources.d.

Your acceleartion times also vary, magazine to magazine Road & Track and Car& Driver have the GS-R at 6.8 to 8.0 for Road and Track. Also Quarter mile times vary from 15.4 to 16.1 You can't tell exactly by the numbers.  Furthermore, the Integra will definately outrun the Beretta on the high end.  Car & Driver and Road & track have the GS-R doing 136 to 141 mph, and it gets there fast.   ***You always believe those exact numbers, why don't you drive a GS-R, and see for your self, while the GS-R has a low 117 torqye, its high gearing over a 8000 rpm make up for the difference (still wouldn't call it a torque moster though!)

You can rev that car all day, everyday, and you'll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else. (I speak from expierence!) I'm not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when you comparing it to a Acura Engine.  AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is a better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  And does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.\",\" I'm an new to this.  Having found some files (public) to look into, I ftp'ed them to a system I have access to.  I then used kermit to transmit them via modem to my host computer, a PC-based file system.  I access internet through modem access to a university mainframe.  From the PC file server, I pull the files to a disk, and then pull them from disk to a SGI Indigo (the SGI is not networked yet).  When I try to uncompress and un-tar the files, they either come out as garbage or I get an error in the tar process about directories being invalid. What I'm wondering about is the transfer of UNIX files (compressed, binary,ascii) about multiple platforms.  My guess is that it is the copy to a 'dos' disk that is screwing things up.  Any help is appreciated. bob \",\" OH yes they do! but considering i never wash my BMW (unless i need to work on it) i never get cuts untill the tools come out..... altho the best scar (now faded) was from the exhaust piper, while try to change the oil, after overheating the engine (watch out for idiot drivers that won't let you pass in the mountains when you have a rider, case of oil (it was on sale), and case of  beer), with a drain bolt that decided to seize.  just how does everyone else clean out the area under the transmission on a BMW R bike? they only way i have found is to remove the engine and transmission. that and the clutch arm are impossible to clean (which is wear one of the EC (s&m) are located). \",\"   This is the new Buffalo one, the second since he's been with the Sabres?

The SF Examiner and Chronicle run the same set of adverts (because they have a joint printing/biz agreement and differ only in editorial content).  I've seen gun ads recently in the merc, which is anti-gun editorially, albeit not from traders, but from its competitors.  I don't know about the other papers.  Does Traders claim that things are changing?  When?   Because it's easier than telling the truth and no one much cares either way.

If I only had to solve the problem for myself, and were willing to have to type in a second password (the secret key) whenever I logged in, it could work. However, I'm trying to create a solution that anyone can use, and which, once installed, is just as effortless to start up as the non-solution of just using xhost(1) to control access. I've got religeous problems with storing secret keys on multiuser computers.   Thanks for the pointer! It was good reading, and I liked the idea of using several unrelated sources with a strong mixing function. However, unless I missed something, the only source they suggested (aside from a hardware RNG) that seems available, and unguessable by an intruder, when a Unix is fresh-booted, is I/O buffers related to network traffic. I believe my solution basically uses that strategy, without requiring me to reach into the kernel.   I heard about this solution, and it sounded good. Then I heard that folks were experiencing times of 30-60 seconds to run this, on reasonably-configured workstations. I'm not willing to add that much delay to someone's login process. My approach (etherfind|compress, skip 10K) takes a second or two to run. I'm considering writing the be-all and end-all of solutions, that launches the MD5, and simultaneously tries to suck bits off the net, and if the net should be sitting __SO__ idle that it can't get 10K after compression before MD5 finishes, use the MD5. This way I could have guaranteed good bits, and a deterministic upper bound on login time, and still have the common case of login take only a couple of extra seconds.\",\"  But you haven't taken into the account of propoganda.  Remember, if you asked Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughtered, they would probably answer no, but, after the propoganda machine rolled through, at least some were able to tolerate it.  You see, it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general frenzy.   Well, they haven't managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity of the courts.  But, they have managed to create quite a few problems for people that wanted to have an abortion.  They could create similar problems for us.  And, it could be worse.  They can try to stop abortions by blocking clinics, etc., but imagine what they'd have to do to stop atheism.   So, you are able to convince them individually, but could you convince a whole room of them?  A whole nation?   Yes, I'd be glad if it were gone to.  I've never supported it.  However, I think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored, contrasted with what *could* happen (an what may be likely).   Well, I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key (the motto can be attributed to him), but it is at least clear that he believed in a god.  And, surely there are a few Christians that think as you say, but I don't think that most do.  Do you think that all Christians actively despise other religions?  Most that I have met haven't and don't do so.   Well, I have asked a Hindu, Moselem, and a few Jews, and all of them think that it is applicable to them.  Of course, I can't say that these people (just some that I know pretty well) are accurate representations of their faiths.   Well, I'd really like to, and I've tried, but I really don't know where to get access to _Congressional Records_ from the 1950's.  Can anyone help out here?   Only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs.    So, are you saying that they redesign the plates each year?  Anyway, your whole argument (conveniently deleted I see) was that the motto somehow costs us all a lot of money.  This is just not correct.   That is to say, the religion of this country, and the non-religion of the USSR.  That was what most of those quotes were about, and some included all atheists, in general, as well.  I don't think that any of the quotes (although I seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about Jesus. They advocated religion over non-religion.  A specific religion was not mentioned.   So, you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions should be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong?  That's silly. I think the Flat-Earthers are wrong, but I don't advocate their banishment.   I think that any such cost would be insignificant.  I mentioned the slight cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by being on our currency.   Well, mottos in general don't really have purposes...  I don't think it should be removed because I think the benefit would be outweighed by the consequences.   Then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress.   Why not?  It is the majority that put it there.   But do they remember the debate surrounding the motto?  Do they remember that some people intended it to be a message against atheists?  Why don't you include this in your little survey that you were conducting?  [...]  What?  Should I ask some scientists the probability that something Einstein said about relativity is worthy?  I mean, if Einstein said it, there's a good chance that it was right (at least at the time).   You need not agree with them all of the time, but you would certainly think that their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point.   No, I think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a Supreme Court Justice to testify before Congress during the consideration of a Constitutional Amendment.  And, in order for the Court to rule on something, a case usually must be presented.   Yes, some mushrooms can be planted.  And, I don't appreciate mushrooms on my pizza, either.

SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides  SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers. SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit},  and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}.

The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2  controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device {As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the \\\"20% faster then IDE\\\" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 controller chip. SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips {becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit mode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips {or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware (port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.

Will the higher : resolution be noticed for these? :  If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript. I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript. It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation processed PS.  The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.  We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's demo though).

Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple (early March).  Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is it because too many people take French and German in college to make the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance. Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.   For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.  Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.   Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care.  At that point, they wouldn't even consider a \\\"voucher\\\" approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.   It is \\\"free\\\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda.  The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer  1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For  1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance. Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.   Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.  When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's public health insurance plan.  gld\",\"--  Thanks to all of you who gave advice on the CB900 Custom.   As recommended, I had the bike compression tested.  Compression was a little low, but very even across the four cylinders (+/- 5 psi).  They said that it was tested a little cold, so that would explain the low  numbers (around 90).  Does this sound right?  Otherwise, the bike looked great.  No signs of road rash, and no rust.  This bike looks great!  It is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.   I am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those  who posted this other thread).  This bike is _BIG_ compared to my other bikes.   ( Sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the KDX200 was. )  I should be road legal tomorrow.  I am ignoring the afforementioned concerns about  the transmission and taking my chances.  Being a reletively new reader, I am quite impressed with all the usefull info available on this newsgroup.  I would ask how to get my own DoD number, but I'll probably be too busy riding ;-).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\",\"   Yeah.  I don't use the clutch all the time either.  I've done it with Fords, BMW, Datsun, and Chevy and it works fine.  I can't think of any reason that it would damage the tranny.  Essentially you are just doing what the synchros do anyhow - match the engine speed with the tranny speed and slip it into gear.      Sounds about right.  I usually slip it out during throttle-down and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right (usually about a second) and then slip it into gear...  --  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Jon \\\"You obviously don't know who you're dealing with\\\" Gross jong@halcyon.com\",\"CBD>From: Christopher Bradley Devlin <cd1i+@andrew.cmu.edu>  CBD>>but it's nothing compared to the (ahem) unique helmet CBD>>design seen in the new Animated Series: it has a huge opening for his CBD>>mouth, topped by the world's tiniest eyeslits above the enormous mouth CBD>>opening.

He drags his knee in corners (thanks, Cookson, but how does he do it? Hidden Bat-pucks?), and he only takes the bike out in the snow or rain. Also, he lets Robin ride! I think I could have used a Bat-mom. Would have made getting my license a lot easier!  There's a trend here: Stylish helmet, Stylish knee-dragging, rides only in Stylish cartoon precipitation. Hmm . . . Could it be that we're dealing with a veritable airborne mammalian poseur? Dare I say it, a BAT-SQUID?? (huh? Bat-Squid?) It all adds up now . . .  Let's make the B-man an honorary DoD DuDe. All he needs is a DoD sticker.  Actually, anyone have an address for Batman's current artists, both comic book and animated series? We'll write and ask if Batman would like to become an honorary Denizen! Yeah!  Special To The KoTL: Is there a precedent for inducting an imaginary member with an imaginary motorcycle? Having seen the computers in the Bat-Cave, I think we can safely assume that he also has imaginary Internet access.

It probably won't be effective in tinea pedis because the laser is usually a superficial burn (to avoid any deeper damage). Limited tinea pedis can be cured albeit sometimes slowly by topical antifungals as well as systemic medication i.e. tablets.

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan- ger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the  physical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had  an awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas ornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this  went on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and  was in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into tears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .  Then someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I  want to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am  silent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling me, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the one whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place,  telling him, \\\"I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring  her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse.\\\" He went and returned empty handed, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his  apartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were  walking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls.  There was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.  They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I  went down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the apartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be  cowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the  doors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth,  opened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle  Sabir's son started to shout, \\\"Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!\\\" He  knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma.  Aunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their  apartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying delirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother. All of my family had gathered there.     At the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the apartment.  Later I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, \\\"Lyuda,  Karina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes  you, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful.\\\" It was as though her whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one  side, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her  cheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole microdistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, \\\"Fine.\\\" Mamma was  afraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started  to cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the bed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye  that was intact, looked at me, and said, \\\"Who is it?\\\" But I could barely talk,  my whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered something tender, something incomprehensible, but tender, \\\"My Karochka, my Karina, my  little golden one . . . \\\" She understood me.  Then Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips.  She started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't  understand it. Then I made out, \\\"It hurts, I hurt all over.\\\" Her hair was  glued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her  forehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how  to help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She's saying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil  and paper and says, \\\"Write it down.\\\" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I  can't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me  something, but she couldn't. I say, \\\"Karina, just lie there a little while, then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then.\\\" And then she says, \\\"Maybe it'll be too late.\\\" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn't control myself.  Then I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She  says, \\\"Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this  damned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We need to call Urshan.\\\" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I  understood her every word. I ask, \\\"What's his number?\\\" Urshan Feyruzovich,  that's the head of the administration where she works. \\\"We have to call him.\\\"  But I didn't know his home number. I say, \\\"Karina, what's his number?\\\" She  says, \\\"I can't remember.\\\" I say, \\\"Who knows his number? Who can I call?\\\" She  says, \\\"I don't know anything, leave me alone.\\\"  I went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was  crying, too. I say, \\\"Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can  we call him? Who knows his telephone number?\\\" I tell Marina, \\\"Think, think,  who can we call to find out?\\\" She started calling; several people didn't  answer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and  found out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he  was at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says,  \\\"Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and  tell them that they just can't do that.\\\" She still didn't know what was really going on. I said, \\\"It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's  happening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single  Armenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised  that we managed to save ourselves. \\\"She says, \\\"Well, OK, if it's that serious  . . . \\\" And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up  and that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. \\\"OK,  fine, fine,\\\" she says, \\\"if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back  I'll send him over.\\\"  We called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly  under Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She  wasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed  everything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on trying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and  finally we get through. She says, \\\"Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your  place now.\\\" He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either,  because he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep  with his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what  shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has  grown up daughters, they're almost my age.  The three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and went down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No,  first they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As soon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said that we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have fractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the first floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around eleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I  saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies . . . everything just like a war.  They carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical people from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older  Armenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud  she would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle  Arkady, I think, because someone said \\\"Arkady, get an injection ready,\\\" he  started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But  when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his  sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and  started to cry: \\\"What have they done to you?!\\\" He was speaking Armenian. \\\"What have they done to you?!\\\" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and  she started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \\\"I'll give you a shot.\\\"  Mamma tells him, \\\"I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what  are they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people, and you're just sitting here!\\\" Some teacups were standing on the table in  there. \\\"You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my  daughters! Look what they've turned them into!\\\" They gave her something to  drink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the doctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa  and Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina  out. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I  don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: \\\"What's  the matter with you?\\\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter in the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's. I said, \\\"I'm fine.\\\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told  the doctor, \\\"You leave, let a woman examine her.\\\" A woman came, an  Azerbaijani, I believe, and said, \\\"What's wrong with you?\\\" I was wearing my  sister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When  she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would  be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed her. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge  wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said  something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be  dressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.  They put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me.  I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't  know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \\\"Lie still, you mustn't move.\\\" When I was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed  very familiar to me. I shouted, \\\"Stop!\\\" One of the policemen turned and says,  \\\"What do you want?\\\" I say, \\\"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\\\" They  brought him over and I said, \\\"That person was just in our apartment and he  just raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\\\" They said,  \\\"Fine,\\\" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were  taking him.  Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were  sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car  up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \\\"Sister . . . \\\" I don't  remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they did to us. I asked him, \\\"Where are you from?\\\" He said that he was from Ufa.  Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I  learned that they suffered most of all. He says, \\\"OK, you're Armenians, they  didn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,\\\" he says, \\\"what are they trying  to kill me for?\\\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the  balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw  two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed  against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him with his own club. The way he cried \\\"Mamma\\\" made my skin crawl. I don't know  what they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before  he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the third or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was  Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they were throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with  someone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the  yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that I realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.  They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too  and said, \\\"I've been beaten too, help me.\\\" But they just ignored her. My  father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault  that he'd been beaten, and says, \\\"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have  probably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\\\" The doctor says, \\\"That's not my job.\\\" Urshan said, \\\"Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor,  I'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them  to his apartment.  Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the  doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I  wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very surprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the Hippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy-- coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she, having examined Karina, said, \\\"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like  they did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women. \\\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she would certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same  story. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no  drugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon found out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And they started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at  zoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from  seeing it.  They put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have  any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their  place, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira  her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And Ira was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed. When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she  involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again. Her daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful  when I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \\\"Do what you want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\\\" Well, they did what they  wanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I  would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It  was simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do  every day: steal, kill, rape . . .  Many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts  explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those  children would be grown, and then, as they put it, \\\"we'll come take the  pleasure out of their lives, those children.\\\" This was about the girls that would be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow  because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just as there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be  of some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the  victims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they themselves said that.  And this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many  people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know  why their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before,  maybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and  they weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at  nothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with  Marina: \\\"Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over  there [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman  shouldn't see such things.\\\" So they were really quite sober . . .  So we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all  happened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several  hours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what happened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk- ing to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he thought no one is listening: \\\"Listen,\\\" he'll say, \\\"what could I do? What could I do alone, how could I protect them?\\\" I don't know where to find the words, it's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen.  That's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of  course he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail of what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke together in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never present at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And when the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.  On February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital. First they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city,  the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier.  There were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family  there. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They  were sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife  and Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.  Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard. There's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area. They took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide. The women were shouting. They explained to them: \\\"We want to hide you better because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\\\"  We went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We had children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to  have their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful.  They kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you  could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the  police precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is  surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were  standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought  great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't  just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48, or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost  family members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened  when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single person, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must have already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret  room down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at one another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those  people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that the end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the  hospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my  parents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should  attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an  Armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and  she wouldn't be able to take it.  Then soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people  climbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers. They all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We  calmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some  little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children to the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never  have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people  do eat.  Then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They  were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from  the courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a  different woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing,  and calling out: \\\"Oh, Rafik!,\\\" but when she heard about this such a rage came  over her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her  sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were  soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash  him! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not  one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from  doing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands,  muttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile appeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round was over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing  terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the  creeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did  this the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She  went five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women,  \\\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they  raped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though  nothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?\\\" She appealed to everyone, but no  one got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I  could barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so  many hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already after ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the  elderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time.  There was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking.  The situation was deplorable.  At eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen,  Azerbaijanis. They said, \\\"Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up and put the children to bed.\\\" Now the women didn't want to leave this place,  either. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with  dogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \\\"Oh, it's our little  family,\\\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for  the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone spoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded machine guns in their hands, said, \\\"Grandmother, you mustn't approach me, I'm on guard.\\\" Our people would say, \\\"Oh, that's all right.\\\" They hugged them, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly moving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.  They took us up to the second floor and said, \\\"You can undress and sleep in  here. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city.\\\" This was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other places. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the SK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I  asked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me. I didn't know what was happening there. They told me, \\\"Don't worry, the Maternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest assured. I say, \\\"Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in there is capable of anything.\\\"  When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had already been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi- tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once we were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met  acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who  hadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with  them, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had  come their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like  they had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people,  hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of  course the stories and the talk were flying: \\\"Oh, I heard that they killed  him!\\\" \\\"What do you mean they killed him!\\\" \\\"He stayed at work!\\\" \\\"Do you know  what's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.  And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very  well and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small  room, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night  talking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary  of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see  Bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed  from outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask  him things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by  soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with  the people. Apparently he had more important things to do.  Several hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \\\"Lyudochka, find another  two or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs,  lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people  who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\\\" I  had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \\\"Lyuda, your  Mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are  alive and well and that you're here.\\\" I gave the lists to someone and asked  them to continue what I was doing and went off.  The list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's father, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels Grigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the  name of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said  that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front of the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later  it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had somehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for  Krasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that  in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored  missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3  All the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were  contained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple  of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \\\"What's  going on?\\\" He said, \\\"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels they are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev [Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to him, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it was one or fifty.\\\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they should ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over again. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26 was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because that's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26  people on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only  a half of those that were on the first list. He said, \\\"Lyuda, please, try to remember at least one more.\\\" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there were more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy don't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people  whose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of the Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many  people left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns in Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the  Krasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that  there are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical  Krestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk  cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went  to help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering the city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the  Azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's more. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list  drawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course don't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to  publicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court,  they simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them is the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No.  8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know  her name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in  Microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the  same landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding  the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and  when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her  braid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because  they didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one  . . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.  They transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for days in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there  and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina;  it was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could  already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the  social work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said,  \\\"If it weren't for the work I would go insane.\\\" He and I put ourselves in gear and took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers  and free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything,  although we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been  dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it  was free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by to see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly visible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.  On March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir Fedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered  only Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital. Mother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.  Shirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I  told him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and record everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind.  We didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the conditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor  quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there  weren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a  curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or  video cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that  we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially  to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw that the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to  Sumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with  Bibishev, I told him myself, \\\"Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two  months, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in those two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation.\\\"  He and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I gave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to her, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her- self. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x- rays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat and drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we were in Baku already, the investigator told me, \\\"How long can you go on like  this? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're not taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this investigation through. We need you.\\\" Then I started eating, because in fact I was exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart- ment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement cells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in every prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of Sumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary  confinement.  Thus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma  identified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify  anyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the  photographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one  who went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the  loose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know  his first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his  sisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that  even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will  continue looking for him.  The 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various  plants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect. Mostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only one of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and Chemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga- tor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front of me \\\"I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash simply for keeping him out of Armenia,\\\" that is, to keep him from landing in a prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even though we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological pressure--they say, \\\"Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an Armenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you in short order.\\\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.  The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire pogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then that I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was  in our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and  all the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned  them, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials from the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James  Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were  boiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had  been in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's  enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't even know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did  take worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out  slippers.  Of those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait.  Basically, the group that went seeking \\\"revenge\\\"--let's use their word for  it--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with  one of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that  black I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking part in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of  Tamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently arrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I  don't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an  Azerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know  nothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an  axe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and  threw them into the tub with water.  I remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You  know, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both  their hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey- eyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I  identified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born in the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How  did I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I  kept thinking, is that Rita or \\\"puma,\\\" which it would be if you read the word  as Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \\\"T\\\" was the one  that looks like a Latin \\\"M.\\\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind his back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to put in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and  told me that I was making a mistake, and called me \\\"dear sister.\\\" He said,  \\\"You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an  Armenian,\\\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator  asked me, \\\"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\\\" I told him, \\\"I'll tell you one more identifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The  name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\\\" He went rigid and became  pale. They told him, \\\"Put your hands on the table.\\\" He put his hands on the table with the palms up. I said, \\\"Now turn your hands over,\\\" but he didn't  turn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they  forced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently. But he insolently stuck to his story, \\\"No, I did not do anything, it wasn't  me.\\\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his hand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew into a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out  of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it.  Catching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked and the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and  back. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how,  but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or  strangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the  microphone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his last name, and he says, \\\"Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . . \\\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped.  They took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down,  because we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \\\"You're  some actress! What a performance!\\\" I said, \\\"Tolya, honestly . . . \\\" Beforehand they would always tell me, \\\"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if  nothing had happened to you.\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have any more strength or  emotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength  . . . I don't have the strength to do anything.\\\" And he says, \\\"Lyuda, how were you able to do that?\\\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching the tape, I said, \\\"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped  that high in gym class.\\\"  So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of  the 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who  beat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.  At the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his  guilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among them were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said,  \\\"Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three o'clock.\\\" He said, \\\"No, I'm not coming.\\\" They told him, \\\"If you don't come  we'll kill you.\\\" He said, \\\"Alright, I'll come.\\\" And he went.  They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He had also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a  motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him  out of his apartment and told him the same thing: \\\"Tomorrow we're going to get the Armenians. Be there.\\\" He said, \\\"No.\\\" They pulled a knife on him. He said,  \\\"I'm not going all the same.\\\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed  him several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was in the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that  we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.  I'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he beat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he was very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for him, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning of Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our  apartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our  apartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I  don't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked out very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina because he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the courtyard, he remained in the apartment.  At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her I learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't  have a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third and, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work with bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.  The others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't call them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out someone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, \\\"I don't  understand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\\\" But we know that they were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the name of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam-- that's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do. Because I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their level of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they work, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they  crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were  promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments. So off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \\\"they  promised us apartments.\\\"  Among them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the heart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a  children's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at  the children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they  have they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or  grandparents. And he said, \\\"I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how I ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my  own, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\\\" And the whole time I kept repeating, \\\"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife  right before your own eyes.\\\" He sat there and just wailed.  But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a  marvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just  have to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his grandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how  to cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he  knew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed  himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.  That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr  Gambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \\\"Let's go, enough, you've spilled enough blood here.\\\"  Maybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was  that they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya and her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They  liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When  Karina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors  old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to  the entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were  already at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back and started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have  sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older  woman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of  Karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off. The woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands  and led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth,  he sees everything, and He won't forgive this.  There was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first  floor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a custom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them. But they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is  tantamount to trampling a woman's honor.  Now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we  have gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these  events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come  about? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that  without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not  have happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis, let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their  nations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are  a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for what they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they  threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done, to snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on February 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone  who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left for their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got as far away as their legs would carry them.  February 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came  into my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had  been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for  a meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few  teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or  seven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there  were a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the  evening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and  the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the  microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the  driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani child off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had seen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \\\"Death to the Armenians! They must be killed!\\\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because  people were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The  woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians  cut her daughters' breasts off, and called, \\\"Sons, avenge my daughters!\\\" That  was enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the  direction of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.  We stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a  very nationalist speech. He said, \\\"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\\\" This  he repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him  stormily, whistling and shouting \\\"Karabagh!\\\" He said, \\\"Karabagh has been our  territory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my  heart?\\\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \\\"It's our  territory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated.  From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from time immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years  the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\\\" By filth he meant  Armenians.  I heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely. Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with  the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate, that in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our teachers said, \\\"Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's  spouting,\\\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we  listened to the woman's speech.  Right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the  subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of studies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I had considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to  obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me, \\\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If  they find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I  tell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?\\\" When he  said it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a  second time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already after eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered,  \\\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until  twelve. Stay here.\\\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in  kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \\\"I left my  children at the kindergarten.\\\" The director excused her. When she let her go I turned around, said, \\\"Good-bye,\\\" and left with the young teacher, the  Azerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.  When we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran nearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too  much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed  off. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher  wouldn't say that I was an Armenian.  To make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at  the movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and again my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched  television as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last  day. That's how it all was.  At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together, Zhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store  on Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she  doesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father  held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the  ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went  out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the  entryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders  there. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the  moment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been  injured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor,  and their children: any way they could.   Where it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin,  Armen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims  what was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one  another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even  with muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and  their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got  them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked  electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then  they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an  Azerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director and told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to  escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of  course, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only thing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The  Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored  personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and led everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored  personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that  very moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.  I heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big,  strong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a  strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.  One of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking  for the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected,  people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps  dead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went  with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found  Azerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and  put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or  infection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the  neighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject  came up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the  basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor carried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing  as one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor  took his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything  seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing  of ours he had managed to \\\"save.\\\"  Raya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended  themselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were Azerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some  reason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just  victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too.  In the TV show \\\"Pozitsiya\\\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that  the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not  important, the truth will come out regardless.  So that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our  bravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the  years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've  become, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.  On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said that it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments received by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans  will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the  Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga- tion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on  the street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear speaking our native tongue.

Caratzas, NY, pages 118-145  \",\" I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points. However, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I feel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more.   IMHO  Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not think he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the game. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I still would not back him for the Hall of Fame.  Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are (in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a bit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he was with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I think it deserves some consideration.  Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of Kingman.  Darrell Evans - No.  Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although a silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not sure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both the average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just think, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.  Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the top of my head I would take Lee Smith first.   Well, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I talked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers offensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have shattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved games? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more than numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers). Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does George Brett who also belongs in this class of player.   Steve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone making a case for him.   Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might bring up his name.  Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still has time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately.  Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him having some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not hear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even top 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame because of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers - even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL the possible votes.  So in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.  Yes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan Maybe - Murray and L. Smith No - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman  As I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this up - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.\",\"I have a few questions I'd like to ask; First,How would someone(me)be able to get a dealers license     and second,besides dear old departed gramp's,where would I find a good place to learn gunsmithing.   all replies appreciated!

I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me. The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and  learn as much as possible about it.     In my five years of education in this field, though brief  compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of  question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or CS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this kind of question is irrelevant.      I have come to believe that choosing CS because one  does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does not like to program is really doing an injustice of building and computer and making it useful for something.  Everything is interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a  part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.   My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision based on which major will give you the best opportunities to  learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your  persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to explore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the school would make a student choose a major before her/his sophamore year.                     Hey you may be so interested in this field that you  decided to learn all about the making of computers in which  case, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.   About the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you are good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else.  If you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.

(now what does require some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation of what's out there....) But there is NO evidence - pro or con - for the existence or non-existence of God (see what I have to say below on this).   Sorry if I remain skeptical - I don't believe it's entirely a conclusion. That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God is correct - neither have I. But lack of evidence for the existence  of something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something  (the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they  disprove evolution the establish creation). You (personally) have never  seen a neutrino before, but they exist. The \\\"pink unicorn\\\" analogy breaks down and is rather naive. I have a scientific theory that explains the  appearance of animal life - evolution. When I draw the conclusion that  \\\"pink unicorns\\\" don't exist because I haven't seen them, this conclusion has it's foundation in observation and theory. A \\\"pink unicorn\\\", if it did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities. That is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from \\\"more primitive\\\" ancestors these pink unicorns would share  a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. God, however, has no such correspondence with anything (IMO). There is no physical frame work of observation to draw ANY conclusions FROM.      I disagree with you profoundly on this. I haven't defined God as existence - in fact, I haven't defined God. But this might be getting off the subject - although if you think it's relevant we can come back to it.    You are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand what I'm saying. I'm making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy. I'm not trying to convince you of anything. *I* Believe - and that rests upon Faith. And it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you that they can logically prove God or that they have \\\"evidence\\\" or ..., then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).  BTW, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not EVEN wrong.    I don't follow you here. Certainly one can make observations of things that they didn't know existed. I still maintain that one cannot use observation to infer that \\\"God does not exist\\\". Such a positive assertion requires a leap.       Once again you seem to completely misunderstand me. I have no EVIDENCE that \\\"'god is' is meaningful\\\" at ANY level. Maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of God down your throat. I, however, am not doing this. I am arguing one, and only one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap - it requires faith. I am, as you would say, a \\\"theist\\\"; however, there is a form of atheism that I can respect - but it must be founded upon honesty.     \",\" C'mon, Tommy Soderstrom is having a fine rookie (I think he's a rookie) season with the Flyers.

Write yourself a minimal \\\"file system\\\" program that is used to create/delete files, en/decrypt them to ramdisk, list a directory. Put the util, password protected, on a floppy.     The catch is that the storage space used by this util is NOT part of the DOS file system.  Instead, defrag your disk, thus packing all allocated clusters into clusters 0-n.  Then use the back end of the partition to hold your 'stealth' file system.  Or, leave a small 2nd partition on the disk that is not assigned to DOS.  Another approach might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files (DOS system files, for instance).  Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage  unit of a \\\"cluster\\\" there is unused physical space on the disk between the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster. These dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file system.     Now you have a situation where no encrypted data \\\"appears\\\" on your disk at all :-). \",\"I've recently ordered a Centris 650 and need to decide on which modem to buy.

Thanks for your help in advance  Kirt Wilson Northwestern University  -------------------------------\",\"  The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13).  And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the inevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are doing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is possible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the eyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing people for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and Annias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His plan might be accomplished.     But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to execute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to fulfill the chorus of \\\"Let his blood be upon our hands\\\" of the crowd in Jersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel, which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish other nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament.  Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, \\\"Mene, mene, tekel, peres?\\\"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's justice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians as their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the extirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel.  The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and the Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go on with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is quite clear. Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to question why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom, He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans 9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of Jesus Christ is as follows: \\\"Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.\\\"  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - \\\"Let the dead bury the dead, come, follow me.\\\"  There is not an infinite amount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to follow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, \\\"well, alright, you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your plans.\\\"  He said \\\"Follow me.\\\"  His message is NOT \\\"I'm just a sweety-pie who would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and Divine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale.\\\"  \\\"Our great God and Savior\\\" Jesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the world.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.\",\" Shure it is temperature dependent, but this does not clean all your problems.

Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the people almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are there to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'.  For example, a majority could vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc. and it would fly using the logic above.  When government feels the Constitution is not right for the times, there is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis is deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those who decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a majority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting the hangee.

John has described some of these.  On the other hand, some people  seem to start tuning out `the same old words' and pay attention better  when things get changed around.  I think innovative priests and liturgy  committees are trying to get our attention and make things more  meaningful for us.  It drives me crazy too.   Different people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy.  My  local parish is innovative.  I prefer to go to Mass at the next parish  over.  Sometimes we don't have the option of attending a Mass in the  style which best suits us.  John put a smiley on it but to \\\"just offer  it up\\\" probably is the solution.  A related issue, that it sounds like John does not have to deal with, is  that spouses may have different liturgical tastes.  My husband does like  innovative litury.  It is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual  needs without just going our separate ways.

People might quibble about what \\\"intrinsically\\\" means but the reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we are. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good, but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a  different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do not realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking  on water until a little doubt crept in.  Doesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm \\\"what is man that you [God]  should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower  than the angels\\\"?  I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David was, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath was, but David's power easily defeated Goliath's.  Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what he can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments. I always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done that his whole life, probably anticipating an \\\"attaboy\\\" from the  Messiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything and follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say how can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people. Jesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.  Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid getting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing adultery, we can control our own desires.   I realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how other people see this.    (Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)  Your point about how \\\"hard\\\" other religions are is a good one, just  as your \\\"Parting Question\\\" is a tough question. I think that Muslims worship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name \\\"submission\\\". Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that \\\"God\\\" is impersonal.  Is God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little more my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater  to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but you're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more I must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond my conception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu's conception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology then maybe I wouldn't have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.

For the sake of brevity, I'll present them in some separate     points.      1- As many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of     misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the     program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows:      - It was alleged that:\\\" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah's technological     advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of     change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. \\\"!     These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives      of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology     in Iran after revolution.      -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors     while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen     Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in     contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and     civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.      - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi     aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most     radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total     of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million     dead left from the war.      - The translation of Iranian officials' talks are not 100% true. For     example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: \\\" It hurts me to     see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda.\\\" The      research.\\\"!      2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought     by Iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to      undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to Iran's     big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in     near future and its current deficit in electrical power.      3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of      Technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the     program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed     society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account     the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its     potential role in improvement of Iran's industries and eventually the     lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries     to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones     in scientific and industrial efforts.      4- A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as     much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from     Iran's different sites. They say: \\\"We are not sure if the places visited     by IAEA are the real ones or not\\\" !, or \\\" We can not rely on IAEA's     reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear     activities before\\\" as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build     nuclear weapons!      5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the     program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,     William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking     from the absolute knowledge!         I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their     country in western media, and I hope Iranian authorities continue to     their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs     and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.

Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable with the use of state sponsored coercion.  The notion that coercion can be virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious  consideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.    For example, does \\\"non-initiated force\\\" (coercion) include tax collection? Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned by Adam Smith?  Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the state, how is the state to deal with it?  Exclusively through after the fact arbitration/legal compulsion?     Well, I must admit that the picture of libertarians as Amway participants is somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a  complex, conflictual, industrial society.  I'd venture to point out,  however, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group  of \\\"seminar participants\\\" to \\\"embrace\\\" their philosophy, their  propaganda skills need to be honed.    Frankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a  society in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper government policy.  Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalities can be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  And as Mr. Marx said, the state will just wither away.    On the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating  virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the  current society will help us to live happier lives?

Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom of the 13th.  Who won the game?  -Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs. -Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent  defensive plays behind him to do so. -Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and  got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of  the inning.  Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for the win.  How about the offense? -Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either  one, the Sox would have lost in nine. -Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single. -Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first  to third when... -Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning. -Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of  a help, but it was something. -Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the  way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)  Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as much as Richardson?  Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with only one out!  Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.

From LA Times, Friday, April 9, 1993.  P. A1.    EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer    SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the  Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a  nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than  950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as  12,000 people.    Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco  authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how  operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and  infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,  right-wing and what they called \\\"pinko\\\" organizations.    Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known  organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting  anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking  any laws.    Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to  gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los  Angeles and San Francisco.    Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political  spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan  Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish  Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of  directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San  Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.    People who were subjects of the spy operation included former  Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.  LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who  is based in South Africa.    Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was  confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement  agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and  organizations was sold separately to the South African government.    In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from  police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony  counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West  Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify  the search warrant.    The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than  25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.  Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in  San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation  Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax  attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not  be reached for comment, his office said.    Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a  panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial  recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a  former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.    The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied  repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.  League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an  employee and have said they simply traded information with police  departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.    But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,  San Francisco police alleged that \\\"ADL employees were apparently less  than truthful\\\" in providing information during an earlier search  conducted without a warrant.    David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said  the organization has not violated the law.  \\\"There is nothing  nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,\\\" he said.  \\\"Our  record speaks for itself.\\\"    The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret  fund used to pay for \\\"fact-finding operations.\\\"  Lehrer, according to  the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.  Patterson.    An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to  a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending  them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.    Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for  nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with  San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many  sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as  \\\"Skins\\\" and \\\"Pinkos,\\\" but that did not necessarily mean that they were  under surveillance.    \\\"I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,\\\" Bullock said.  \\\"And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a  threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,  say, 'Pinko.'\\\"    In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police  Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he  was questioned by the FBI in the case.    A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records  and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,  vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license  photographs.    Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and  Bullock also provided information to the South African government,  receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.    The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the  South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss  nature of the spy operation.    The file notes that Kraft's articles \\\"appear frequently in The Times  and are well researched and written,\\\" but little else about the file  is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another  Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong  Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal  information.    Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how  Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from  skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash  of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his  own paid informants under code names such as \\\"Scott\\\" and \\\"Scumbag.\\\"    He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,  exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,  including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.    It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying  on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African  government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an  agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the  probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The  Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather  information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,  Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and  investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league  offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of  San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax  Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to  cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los  Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that  some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may  have come from Los Angeles police officers.        From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.    ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.    SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a  civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities  who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential  police information on citizens and groups.    But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation  League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many  felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax  violations and conspiracy.    Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful  about its spying operations, which collected information on more than  12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political  spectrum.    Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show  that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept  files on political figures.    Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down  its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when  deciding what charges to file.    In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.  Foxman described the ADL as \\\"a Jewish defense agency which has fought  to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80  years.\\\"    Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on  extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing  information to police, journalists, academics, government officials  and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain  information illegally, he said.    \\\"Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and  physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or  identity of any source of information,\\\" Foxman said.    The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its  longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than \\\"a private  individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'\\\"    Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements  showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through  Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.    \\\"Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be  distanced from ADL,\\\" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.  Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.    Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate  with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn  over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's  offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.    A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,  produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial  transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it  will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.    \\\"The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,\\\"  the district attorney said.\",\"  I am told (by the person who I care a lot about and who I am worried is going to start putting his health and money into homeopathy without really knowing what he is getting into and who is the reason I posted in the first place about homeopathy) that in Britain homeopathy is available on the National Health Service and that there are about 6000 GPs who use homeopathic practices.

One you have supplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the future (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating high-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less), I am not  going to care much about US confidentiality, am I?

One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.   Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable for a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware? In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you just swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of that cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that it would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search algorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware. I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.   However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its  designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion  of such techniques seems credible.  Hmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name \\\"Clipper\\\" for this device. :) \",\"  Lot's of these small miners  are no longer miners.

Lack of a marriage certificate doesn't force a couple to break up.  This is an excuse used by homosexuals because the  alternative is to ask why they are so much more promiscuous than  straights.   \",\"Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral, other than Leviticus? So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from Leviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be ignored by Christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).  Later, Max (Bob) Muir  [The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly cited passages are:  the story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and there's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate position on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the Bible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been known specifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a cesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes, homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action described.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about as many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of guests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically about homosexuality.  In the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom 1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil. Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about idolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at least result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this passage.  It does not use the word \\\"homosexuality\\\", and it is referring to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality. So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality. But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway, that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards  homosexuality.  The other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim 1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used here mean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning, such as \\\"wanton\\\", and that another may be specifically \\\"male prostitute\\\".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching about homosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul shared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.  Jude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  The context in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in Sodom were angels, it seems likely that \\\"strange flesh\\\" refers to intercourse with angels.  As you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion is determined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that the passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OT prohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT endorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and no clear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in Rom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly do the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is legitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his background and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.  This is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long dissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it's clear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down to is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This appears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as a whole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today. This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference between Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both sides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the other side will finally come to their senses.  That makes things very frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic outcome is not very likely...\",\"  For a brief, but pretty detailed account, try Hempel's _Philosophy of Natural Science_.   This smacks a bit of ideology -- the supposition being that Toricelli's subsequent descriptions of his reasoning are not veridical.  It gets dangerously close to an unfalsifiable view of the history and methodology of science if we deny that no subsequent reports of experimenters are reliable descriptions of their \\\"real\\\" reasons.   But my point is that this type of case is *not* a rarity.  In fact, I was going to point to Pasteur as yet another rather common example -- particularly the studies on spontaneous generation and fermentation.  I will readily concede that \\\"ridiculous reasons\\\" can play an important role in how scientists spend their time.

Right now, I'm just going to address this point. When the Jewish National Fund bought most of its land, It didn't buy it from the Palestinians themselves, because, for the most part, they were tenant farmers (fallahin), living on land owned by wealthy Arabs in Syria and Lebanon. The JNF offered a premium deal, so the owners took advantage of it.   It's called commerce.  The owners, however, made no  provisions for those who had worked for them, basically shafting  them by selling the land right out from under them. They are to blame, not the Jews.  \",\"       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Is this Tony Esposito?  If memory serves me correctly, Chicago.

Judaism did not father Islam.  We had many of the same prophets, but Judaism ignores prophets later prophets including Jesus Christ (who Christians and Muslims believe in) and Mohammed.  The idea of believing in one God should unite all peoples.  However, note that Christianity and Islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views and the rights of non-Christians and non-Muslims are stated in each religion.   We are supposed to pay 6% of our income after all necessities are paid.  Please note that this 6% is on a personal basis - if you are poor, there is no need to pay (quite the contrary, this money most often goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor Muslims around the world).  Also, this money is not required in the human sense (i.e. a Muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money and nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid (and we surely don't pass money baskets around during our prayer services)).  God's presence is certainly on Earth, but since God is everywhere, God may show signs of existence in other places as well.  We can not say for sure where God has shown signs of his existence and where he has not/.  The Qur'an is not a copyright of the Taurah.  Muslims believe that the Taurah, the Bible, and the Qur'an originally contained much the same message, thus the many similiarities.  However, the Taurah and the Bible have been 'translated' into other languages which has changed their meaning over time (a translation also reflects some of the personal views of the translator(s).  The Qur'an still exists in the same language that it was revealed in - Arabic.  Therefore, we know that mankind has not changed its meaning.  It is truly what was revealed to Mohammed at that time.  There are many scientific facts which were not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later such as the development of the baby in the mother's womb.   Only God knows for sure how it will turn out.  I hope it won't, but if that happens, it was the will of God.  Please send this mail to me again so I can read the rest of what you said.

I assumed, that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the  input value, and divides it over the wave period. / Right?/    Now, I used it to measure the same  square wave as above, but distorted  by high-frequency harmonics. Ideally, output should be the same, but... The output value was only about 10% of the previous one!     Why? What is the nature of this output value? What does the voltmeter  actually measure? And what does it show?       Related question (less important to me):    What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with  analog ones?

Mostly, that means water turning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would  also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.  As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in a dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private ownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe condition. If any random private citizen could not properly keep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation is clearly appropriate.    I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community. If you look at the American  revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves from, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They didn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for  example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same old regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and destroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate. But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited for that.  There is also the question of personal and collective arms: The Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers other arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example) a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively) should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a  disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower. The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely democratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only 50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would be proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular will were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the form of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's firepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not of the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite different from the general public (at the very least, they would be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and character of the militia requires that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal weapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.\",\" Oh?

Come on, Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant. Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders.   YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**. Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.  But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel doesn't have a game like that in him.   Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about Roussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah, Dom has played well too.

Leading Edge seems to be a decent brand and what-not. I would tend to say that it is a decent deal. The only things you might want to be wary about is that my L.E. computer has a back-plane mounted motherboard. Ie: The motherboard itself is a card that can be plugged in to a backplane. Some people don't like these configurations. The second thing is that whoever set up my computer at the factory didn't really know what they were doing. The installed windows video driver didn't even take advantage of the SVGA card/Monitor. Look forward to configuring the system optimally yourself. \",\" The part about spending $5000-7000 on repairs reminds me of an article I read in a magazine comparing the 5 year ownership costs of a Toyota Camry and a Ford Taurus or something like that.  The result, which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period.  That was their argument to prove that you don't go wrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry.   Now, if I remember correctly, the Camry costs about $4000 or so more in initial costs.  Essentially, it means that you spend about $4000 extra on repairs on the Taurus.  That is ridiculous.  Every time your car needs repairs, it is extra hassles, loss of time and a dozen other things. I would much rather spend $5000 more in initial costs than spend $4000 more in repair costs. \",\" You assume this because you believe in a designing creator, and you observe our ability to procreate...   ....

How is it that one ability is \\\"obviously from God\\\", and the other not?   I want to know the truth, and hold the Truth as the most basic of all ethical values, because correct moral judgement relies on knowing the truth, not vice versa. Moralities that assert that assent to a belief is a moral choice, and not compelled by evidence inevitably cut off the limb they sit upon.

Any reason you think that inner city kids are incapable of doing legitimate work?\",\" Imprecise. This description   1. ignores the role of the ballast,  2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.  The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts short circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much less heat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared to the neon discharge.  The starter contacts open before the tube fires.  Actually, the tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballast because of this immediate opening of the starter's contacts.  A capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent excessive arcing during the firing.  The neon reionizes but does not draw sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself.\",\" The third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than Apple's. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.   That's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire (BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240 all have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly remembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all of them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered DESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used with a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.  My advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:  (1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add     machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going     for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which     means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.     As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it     unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).  (2) On the Mac side, you will need:     - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).     - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).     - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be       getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).     - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the       Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is       self-terminated or not.     - configure MacTCP to use \\\"Ethernet\\\".  (3) On the DECstation side, you will need:     - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.     - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.       Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the       DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable       (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).     - get a 25ohm terminator.

I want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap once I start running out of allocatable cells, using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color.  Once I determine if a cell is read-only, I assume I can then just request an XAllocColor() with the exact same color specifications and it will  then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another application.  So far, the only way I've figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors, once my colormap is all full up.  It should error out if the cell is non-shareable. But life would be much easier if I could just detect the read-only/shareable stuff directly...

The second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal' drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data.

I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to  main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate, and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the F.B. followed by a write)  If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in CPU main memory, the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower, depending on your OS's implementation of shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window, which is also then just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device.  One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large, you don't end up growing the size of the server process to hold them.  One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that, in its sample implementation, there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., \\\"kill\\\").  You have to  be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.   Ken\",\"Sorry about that - don't want to alarm anyone...

From a theological bent, those who lived immediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son Nimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a stronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of hardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on his shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.  It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and thus he became the \\\"Elevator of the heavens.\\\"  This \\\"god\\\" made men able to \\\"feel\\\" as if heaven were afar off and \\\"as if either the God of Heaven could not see through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of His laws.\\\"  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled \\\"Emancipator\\\" or \\\"Deliverer\\\"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system and abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many benefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a Deliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the other actually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it as true.   I don't see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to the coming \\\"Anointed One\\\" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who was to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the Crucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the dispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it as a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation via faith and nothing else.   I understand what you're trying to convey, but I don't think I'd lay hold of it because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal life is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of consciousness.     It depends upon your def of \\\"lost.\\\"  The elect were lost only in time as outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world.  Existentially we were all born \\\"lost\\\", but the \\\"righteous\\\" were \\\"in Christ\\\" and therefore never *assuredly* lost.

But that is not what I was referring to.    No, I understand it as you have said. This was my point.   Ah!  This is it.  This is the big question.  However, I would say, again I think, that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it.  Look at Satan's twist of God's Word when he coerced Eve.

They were not known as \\\"mystery\\\" religions for no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private side, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they revealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings to light. The \\\"Mystery of Iniquity\\\" that we find in the Bible, correlates to this I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately, little by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point today might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris in Egypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the \\\"husband son.\\\")   No, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what you're alluding to in that the church, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their worldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.

NEWSPOT, January 1993   MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.  Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.    Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine.    Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly magazine  \\\"ENA\\\"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek general election.    Bulev said in the interview: \\\"I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.\\\" Sideropoulos said  in the  article that \\\"Greece  should recognise Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the border, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC are falling.\\\"    The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court summons,  was   that  \\\"they  have   spread...intentionally  false information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the citizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the international interests of the country (Greece).\\\"    The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian.    In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000 in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.    Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian human rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live.    Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent, especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.    Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections are over.

Khomeini put a  price on the head of someone in another country, this makes him a jerk as well as an international outlaw. Khomeini advocates the view that there was a series of twelve Islamic leaders (the Twelve Imams) who are free of error or sin. This makes him a heretic. In the Qur'an  Muhammad is chastised for error directly by God; the Qur'an says that Muhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior; thus no muslim is free from error.     Perhaps it seems so to you, but this is hardly the case. There is widespread agreement about matters of Islam. There certainly are many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly Islamic in and of themselves, but this is so for any large group of people under the same name.    The Qur'an is not particularly imprecise in wording, though it is true that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of many words. However, as an entire text the Qur'an makes its meanings precise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come to agreement about them.   \",\"I was wondering if anyone knew any changes to the temple ceremony within the last fifty years....

Keeping in mind that the stacking order of overlapping objects affects how they look.

A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.  A fully loaded SL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be somewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range.  A base Taurus (GL I believe) might start around $15,000.

I'm hoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various switches and jumbers are used for.  Anyway, here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card, although I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and 7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4] are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow.        The only identification printed on the board is \\\"MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD\\\" across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number, but it is blank.

I mean, cache speed is one thing, but all your speed will be blocked during video I/O, so just get that faster...

For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth, you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer. A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be the payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within the capability of the amateur rocketry community.  It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reduction of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'. Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed here: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year on the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of an orbital eyesore/CCD burner.  I wouldpledge $1000 for the first person to bring it down, and I am sure there are at least 999 other astronomers, nature lovers, or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.  Of course, a  Gerald Bull solution might be simpler. (Either the solution Gerald Bull would apply--the use of a large caliber gun; or the solution which was applied to Gerald Bull--the use of a small caliber gun.)\",\" XC units are often pre-production sample devices.

Moreover, my comments are based on what Kratz writes.  He's free to argue that he babbles in text but actually knows something off-line.   Harder than what?  I note that almost all revolvers work the same way, so it can't be \\\"harder than revolvers\\\".   Sure they can.  (Moreover, we know now that Kratz' sample is unrepresentative.)  We can look at the reasoning.  It is basically \\\"these Glocks are dangerous because they're not like my 1911/S&W third generation.\\\"  Part of that is true, but since those same people don't claim that revolvers, which share the relevant property, are dangerous, we see that the argument fails.

I am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone, based on Ephesians 2 and Romans 3:21-31.  I also conclude that James 2, when  read in context, is teaching bullet (2) above. When James speaks of  justification, I would claim that he is not speaking of God declaring the believing sinner innocent in His sight (Paul's use of the word).  Instead he is speaking of the sinner's profession of faith being  \\\"justified\\\" or \\\"proven\\\" by the display of good works. Also according  to James 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a \\\"dead\\\" or  \\\"useless\\\" faith which fails to save.  James 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it is teaching (2).  Works would have their place, not as merit toward  salvation, but as evidence of true faith.

Participants who complete the program can earn two semester hours of graduate credit from Aurora College. Please note that while the class is intended for teachers, it is not restricted to teachers.  The class, which is being cosponsored by the United States Space Foundation, will teach how to use space exploration as a teaching tool to get students excited about learning and interested in science.  Classroom topics to be covered by the class include:      > Living in Space      > The Space Shuttle      > The Space Station      > NASA Spinoffs that Benefit Society      > Principles of Astrodynamics/Aeronautics      > The Solar System  There will also be simulated Zero-G training in an underwater space station simulation, model rocket launches, observing sessions at the Harper College Observatory, and field trips to the Adler Planetarium and the Museum of Science and Industry.  Featured speakers include Jerry Brown of the Colorado based United States Space Foundation and Debbie Brown of the NASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Additional instructors will be provided by the Planetary Studies Foundation.  The social highlight of the class will be a dinner banquet featuring Space Shuttle Payload Specialist Byron Lichtenberg, currently President of Payload Systems, Inc. Lichtenberg was a member of the crew of STS-9 which flew in November 1983. The banquet is scheduled for Thursday, June 17.  The registration fee includes transportation for field trips, materials, continental breakfasts, lunches, and the special dinner banquet. Guest tickets for the dinner banquet are also available.  There is an additional charge to receive the two hours of graduate credit. For any additional information about the class, contact the Science Learning Center at (708) 359-7913.

Automatic setups are fine for simple, repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more complex events where you need to understand how the scope is actually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope in \\\"equivalent time\\\" or in \\\"real time\\\" sampling mode (equivalent time being a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to the trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling rate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but before display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.  Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz sample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front end including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for equivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really only helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single sample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.  So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get useful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for general use and the digital for events where I need storage for later analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability of the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to fall...  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin   Phone: (205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking    (205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

Thanks to Ed Vielmetti and several others who contributed to this list.\",\"  Actually I don't think there is any conflict if we really understand what these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the  meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will come to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere  belief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your  belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this  is what James means when he says that \\\"faith without works is dead\\\"  and, \\\"I will show you my faith by my works.\\\"  Remember James was  writing to \\\"the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.\\\"  This  probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much  later and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek. (Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he intended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the people of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of the Greek.  Another key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul's statements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the gospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great burden of Paul's life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go convert a bunch of people, then the \\\"Judizers\\\" would come along and try to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf Acts chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being saved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood of Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation for today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think \\\"faithfulness\\\" today has a meaning closer to what the original writers intended.   I think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is that God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not \\\"keep kosher\\\" to a kosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters of following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.   In the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and  be lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are  worse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in the parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in the one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that the price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.  [I agree with you in general, including the fact that \\\"pistis\\\" has some of the force of \\\"faithful\\\".  However if you take that too far, you can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have intended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we are saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that's not what you meant.  I have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that completely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I'd call a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and commitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic change.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show the new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any Christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that Jesus calls being born again.\",\"I'm interested in simulating reverse (or negative) color video mathematically.

Chris Mussack\",\"A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView. Since he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post it for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:  CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most annoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to do with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its \\\"current directory\\\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell) when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView doesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems  to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \\\"dithering\\\", again writing another file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this second file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does the last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to your screen again.  (It does this last \\\"recopy\\\" operation for its \\\"fit to screen\\\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)   The result of this process is the following:         1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all         you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of         data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never         realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.       2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for         the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the         dithering and writes to the screen card.         However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data         from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)         one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which         there was room on the disk.  This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general idea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details about file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient disk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be very large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess of 6 Meg free disk space.   CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from a floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the floppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT table? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly unrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files menu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info.

My current I/O card uses 8250's (correct number? The braindead ones anyway). It also controls two floppy drives, and two IDE hard drives.  Ideally, I'd like to get a new multi I/O card, that had 2 serial ports with 16550's and could also control another 2 IDE HD's.

Brian West\",\" There are many organisms, viral, bacterial, and fungal, which can cause meningitits, and the course of these infections varies widely. The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adults pneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia) is the most common cause, while in children Hemophilus influenzae is the most common cause.  What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis, which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in both groups, but with lower incidence in infants. This organism is also called the \\\"meningococcus\\\", and is the source of the common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in the press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases), the organism typically causes death within a day.   This organism, feared as it is, is actually grown from the throats of many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by different ways, but blood borne spread is probably the usual case.   Rifampin (an oral antibiotic) is often given to family and contacts of a case of meningococcal meningitis, by the way.  Sorry, but I don't have time for a more detailed reply.

But, at best, he's only a mediocre goaltender.

Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to education, to establish a family and have children, to human dignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are more important to human existence that the rights of states.  2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.  3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an unresolved conflict exists.  4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples and nations.  5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.  6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional political means have failed.  7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the land, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.  8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice. When people love, they share.  Having stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.  1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew and the other Palestinian-Arab.  2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner, although born in areas under current Isreali control, is not entitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.  3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For the second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each subsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.   4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and Christian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of governments and international organizations.  5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on 'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the Middle-East in a graceful manner.  Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will attempt to identify some of these:  1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However, it is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation.  2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the 'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but Israeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be defeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights (see above)  3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their point of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People overrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of human rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar Bronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing assimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its effects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see above)  4.      It may objected that only a few people in Israel/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes.  5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has merits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than $3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government and by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the Middle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a non-segregated society in that worn-torn land.  I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment.\",\" What group is this?

True, Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still, these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with lots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereas Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.      That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb pitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of a chance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no pitching.  At least, to me.      I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team with Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real order, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but with a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.) Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig, Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.      I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by seasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in their best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all the players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And all the offense would have to do is get 1 run across.      I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all- time teams into a regular season, have it played, and report the results I would love to see that.\",\"      Unfortunately, there's not much we can learn from the statistics presented here either.

Don't you?\",\"[remainder of message deleted]  Pardon me for replying to only a portion of your message :)  The reason we can say \\\"God just exists\\\" and can't say \\\"The universe just  exists\\\" is because the universe is a natural realm and is subject to natural  laws in general and the law of cause and effect in particular.  That is, we  observe in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced  by a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be  its own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.  God, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject  to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being,  God's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence  of a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the  supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused  phenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the  supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very  nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.  This is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted  to clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the  natural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being  interchangeable.\",\"Hi,  I am looking for a PC card which does european videotext/teletext descrambling (PAL).

In short, I am happy with the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time futzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor is pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17\\\" Magnavox went away.  It isn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the monitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.  In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA, Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those are all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite card does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3 cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.  The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors listed plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have, and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.  The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone with Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable to recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.  The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they were close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz 386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers were all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with 8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it computes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.

I have no idea what is being done internally as far as conversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to the screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can just be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that face from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie, filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics operations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two numbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching. When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly -- 1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds like programming to a benchmark to me....

One, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24?  3) Are all these cards accelerated or just some? Is it true that modern accelerated video cards are (at least in general) faster? What bit depths are accelerated, all or just 24 bit? I've heard that some applications actually run *slower* with this card if they write directly to the screen (or something like that). Is this a frequent problem? How much slower is it?  4) Didn't I read (when System 7 first came out) that the card was incompatible? If so, how was this corrected (Finder patch, some INIT, or other)? Has it been kept compatible with 7.1? Are there many other apps that it is incompatible with (games or important (i.e., non- Microsloth) apps, for example)?  5) If you have a strong opinion on it's value for someone in my position, let me know what you think a reasonable price is to pay for it.

Rick \",\"Obesssive Compulsive Disorder (not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive _Personality_ Disorder !) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by either obsessions (persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when not entertained), or compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic actions that similarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted).    OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression.    Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved one (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having  recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignore or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.   The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather than being from an external source.  Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing, or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a source of the anxiety.  In OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the individual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their daily routine and social relationships.  Treatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating obsessions and compulsions.  The standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in the DSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .        kind regards,\",\" I'll third the opinion about this outfit/franchise. Now, when I buy over the net and pick up the shipping costs, I'll specify that I only pick up the normal UPS charges (as if delivered directly to UPS), as I've been burned by $10 shipping charges for a $2.49 pkg. I will never use a mailing service unless I don't have the right box and the buyer needs whatever IMMEDIATELY. I'll also tell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on.  Other things to watch out for/consider:   The rates are $5 to $30 higher than UPS direct.   For a non-UPS (truck) package, they quoted a rate  of $85. Fed Ex economy air was only $85 for the  same weight! RPS (a trucking package company, in many  cities) only wanted $18. Guess who got it. The Mailbox  operator told me I was not telling the truth about  competitors' rates, said RPS was unreliable (I've used them  before with NO problems), etc. Right.   A COD check goes to the mailing service. Our local  Mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the  remade check. All this for an additional $3.00 over the  UPS COD charge. What a deal.... :-)   For packages over $100, they charge you about double over  what UPS charges them for insurance. I've never had  a claim, but other netters (is Ralph Seguin out there?)  have told horror stories about them...   All package traces have to be done through Mailbox by  Mailbox.   Our local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I  asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared  to direct UPS. Does he ever check? Probably not...   Their UPS ground rates come close to Fed Ex's economy  air rate, and Fed Ex will pick up!   UPS will pick up for a $5 charge in most areas!   --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin   Phone: (205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking    (205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

Ok, I then proceed to install Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.0. No problem with the installation. I also allow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:). The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse) from the desktop. First of all, I always get the application error screen followed by another application error screen with various different messages. The following are some of them:  - Stack fault, by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some   number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture) - General protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address - Segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same address  Some how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address 0001:XXXX means?   I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the TSR programs from autoexec.bat, no help.  Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling WIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running.

The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because    they are not quoted by the NT authors.  That is not quite accurate.  Otherwise we would have the book of Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the  apocrypha are not quoted by Christ.     III. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because    they teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted)    parts of the canon.     then I answer:     These is a logically invalid *a priori*.     Besides, we are talking about OT texts-     which in many parts are superceded by the NT    (in the Xtian view). Would not this same    principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_?    This principle cannot be consistently applied.   I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one voice, and he does not contradict himself.    The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example, the Lutheran hymn \\\"Now Thank We All Our God\\\" quotes a passage from this book.  The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's history.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the Spirit in so doing.

Our   three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release   that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.   On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family   will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public   awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease   characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and   trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would   lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.    Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis   last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her   lifetime.    Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives   of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory   Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide   support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a   newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid   in the prevention, cure, and treatment.  Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to   those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money   were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant   attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP   Foundation's mission is to change that.   Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call   Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the   Foundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown   Princeton, or sent directly to:\",\": The Swiss population is (and well was) far larger than that.

It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began, whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.  Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of \\\"election fraud\\\" to hold their jobs.  Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too many cases, who they were).  Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.  The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room.  One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy. He said, \\\"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is always so organized every year.\\\"  I got a little pissed, and replied, \\\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\\\"  At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and several Simon's Rock anti-gun \\\"close-the-loophole\\\" protestors. (Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)  The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.  Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up to \\\"support GOAL's position\\\" on \\\"all bills.\\\"  First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students had some curfew, I guess).    Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock folks called the current law a \\\"loophole\\\" and wanted it closed.  Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \\\"SKS assault rifle.\\\" The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri, and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \\\"as strong as\\\" that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.  Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  \\\"In some of these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\\\" (Oooooo!)  \\\"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't be having this situation -- but they won't.\\\"  (Naughty, naughty!)  Next up was Boston city councilman Albert \\\"Dapper\\\" O'Neill.  He was there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were judge, he'd give arrestees their \\\"last rights\\\" (pun intended) on the spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.) He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(  Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction -- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying, \\\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted.\\\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.  Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible. \\\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\\\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook.  The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga. Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \\\"restraining order\\\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He  was a co-sponsor of one of the \\\"restraining order\\\" bills as well.)  One of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \\\"every year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\\\" It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been more effective.  At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue. Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \\\"public\\\" testimony; the other got a seat this time.  Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change. He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great quote: \\\"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state computer system until 1999.\\\"  (This was also an argument he used against the renewable FID card.)  Testimony was heard from several \\\"battered women,\\\" one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how 50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long rambling circumlocution in response.  Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts. Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.  Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law. One of the junior reps noted that \\\"this is America\\\" and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga reiterated this, saying that \\\"people who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order.\\\"  (Point and match, Senator.)  Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his citizenship \\\"expired every 5 years,\\\" and that a driver's license was a privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.  A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public hangings.  The speaker then responded, \\\"I'll make you a deal.  You get me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\\\"  Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \\\"he wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside\\\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \\\"loophole\\\" should be closed to prevent something like this from \\\"ever happening again\\\".  Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on, saying, \\\"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are safe -- support gun control.\\\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \\\"Only residents can get FID's,\\\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off?)  Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental record.  One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \\\"elitist\\\".  Another (Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had \\\"FID-type\\\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home state was \\\"not enough.\\\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming, \\\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\\\"  All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and GOAL's position) were:  o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull     licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)  o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)  o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly    opposed)  o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws     (opposed)  o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)  o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)  o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)  o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)  o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)  Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.  Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.  Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it. Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said, \\\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\\\"  The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It ended at about 6:30. -- \",\"****UNIX****UNIX****UNIX****UNIX****UNIX****UNIX****UNIX****  FORSALE:          ESIX UNIX System V Release 4 - NEW!         2 user license system - $400         Unlimited user license system - $450         2 user license system with dev kit - $500         Unlimited user license system with dev kit - $550  The above systems include all of the floppies or tapes and instalation manuals.

It's small enough that I will attach it.  I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB cache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to 40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective difference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously better.  I do not have an FPU.  The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference between 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well under $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.  If you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to see them.

But unfortunely the Yards (a definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots. Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for most of the year like '89).   On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.  Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching staff looks pretty good.

I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original announcement.)   For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems. Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev, Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.  I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use.  If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they are rapidly changing!

Box 2476V, Melbourne, Victoria, 3001. AUSTRALIA.\",\"Here is another way of looking at it.  When we die we are released from the arc of time, and able to comprehend our lives in toto.  To visit each moment in time sequentially or all at once, but not able to alter the actions thoughts or feelings we had/have/will have in this  life.  From that perspective, I posit that all will have direct knowledge of God, and be able to recognize at each moment of time wether we were doing what we ought.  That the experience of having lived a life far from God will be an eternal torment.  That  having lived a life of grace, will be an eternal joy.  That the  resurrection of the body comes not from any physical reconstitution of our present forms, but knowledge of our present forms by our fully cognizant souls.  As an Aside:  If we were to be restricted for all time to our present form, would you opt for immortality?  James Sledd\",\"  Terms are being used in a loaded way here.  \\\"Logical proof\\\" is an extremely messy thing to apply to real life. If you think otherwise, try to construct a proof that yesterday happened. Obviously it did; anyone old enough to be reading this was there for it and remembers that it happened. But *proof*? A proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere. You need axioms to talk about logical proof. You can say that you remember yesterday, and that you take as axiom that anything you clearly remember happened. I could counterclaim that you hallucinated the whole thing.  To talk about proofs of historical events, you have to relax the terms a bit. You can show evidences, not proofs. Evidences of the resurrected Jesus exist. Proofs do not.\",\"  First of all, I resent your assumption that you know why I am threatened by science, or even that I am threatened at all, although I admit the latter.  The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence-- God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree, Science.   My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations, for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone. Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have  children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that is made possible.   People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death, and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world.   This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely  prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary  alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,   go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us?   I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not, but I will say this:  Before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body they have been given, they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to  believe their search is displeasing to God.\",\"NHL PLAYOFF RESULTS FOR 4/19/93.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    CONFERENCE SEMI-FINALS        BEST OF SEVEN       PATRICK              ADAMS              NORRIS              SMYTHE    NJ                  BUF   (leads 1-0)   STL   (leads 1-0)   WIN                 PIT   (leads 1-0)   BOS                 CHI                 VAN   (leads 1-0)   NYI                 MON                 TOR                 LA    (leads 1-0)   WAS   (leads 1-0)   QUE   (leads 1-0)   DET   (leads 1-0)   CAL                --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Toronto Maple Leafs                       1   1   1   -   3 Detroit Red Wings    (leads series 1-0)   1   4   1   -   6  1st period: DET, Yzerman 1 - (Gallant, Ciccarelli) 4:48      TOR, Cullen 1 - (Clark, Gill) 10:44  2nd period: DET, Sheppard 1 - (Probert, Coffey) (pp) 5:04      DET, Burr 1 - (Racine) (sh) 6;42      DET, Chiasson 1 - (Coffey) (pp) 11:00      DET, Howe 1 - (Yzerman, Drake) 14;46      TOR, Gilmour 1 - (Borschevsky, Ellett) (pp) 19:59  3rd period: DET, Racine 1 - (Primeau, Drake) 5:10      TOR, Lefebvre 1 - (Cullen, Pearson) 7:45  Powerplay Opportunities-Maple Leafs 1 of 5    Red Wings   2 of 6  Shots on Goal- Maple Leafs   5   9   9  -  23   Red Wings    13   8  12  -  33  Toronto Maple Leafs--Potvin (0-1) (33 shots - 27 saves) Detroit Red Wings--Cheveldae (1-0) (23 shots - 20 saves)  ATT-19,875  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Winnipeg Jets                           1   0   1   -   2 Vancouver Canucks  (leads series 1-0)   2   0   2   -   4  1st period: VAN, Adams 1 - (Linden, Bure) (pp) 1:23      VAN, Craven 1 - (Bure, Murzyn) 9:56      WIN, Steen 1 - (Shannon, Housley) (pp) 17:53  2nd period: NONE  3rd period: WIN, King 1 - (Barnes) 3:43      VAN, Linden 1 - (Courtnall, McLean) 12:16      VAN, Ronning 1 - (Courtnall) 18:31  Powerplay Opportunities-Jets    1 of 3    Canucks 1 of 6  Shots on Goal- Jets      7   5  10  -  22   Canucks   9  12  12  -  33  Winnipeg Jets--Essensa (0-1) (33 shots - 29 saves) Vancouver Canucks--McLean (1-0) (22 shots - 20 saves)  ATT-15,918  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \",\"I have just installed a Diamond Stealth 24 ISA card in a '486DX2-66 system with 256K cache, and 16 megs of memory, that gets about a 126 SI 6.0 CPU Benchmark rating.

Your claim that the Lebanese/Syrian Landlords sold Palestine (if true, even partially) omits the fact that the mandate treaty put Lebanon and Syria under French rule, while Palestine under british.  Obiviously, any such landlord would have found himself a foreigner in Palestine and would be motivated to sell, regardless of the price.  It is interesting though that you acknowledge that the palestinians were shafted. Do many Israelis or Jews share your opinion ?  Do you  absolve the purchaser from any ethical commitments just because it wasn't written down?   All told, I did not see an answer in your response. The question was whether the intent behind the purchase was aimed at controlling the public assets (land, infra-structure etc...). IMHO the Palestinians have grounds to contest the legality of the purchase, say in world court.  Sam \",\"Hi!  I have the following 2 CD's for sale.

Hmmm... Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was   trying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210   and my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need   to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe   place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is   that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it   wrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this   could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.    It could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one   wrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further   correct actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also   my NeXT that way.  Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any   problem, and at pretty high speeds too.

In comparison, in  the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall  decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in  gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of  this disease from 1985 through 1992.       In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department  of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992,  reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively  (Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics  (15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases  with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7%  of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by  age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or  equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all  reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the  largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age  group-specific rate (639 per 100,000).       Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver  metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the  state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area  occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods  considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.       When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among  men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in  the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits  by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases  diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men,  the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised  94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among  self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992,  respectively).       Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO,  university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted  to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea  culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased  23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the  fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).       From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and  Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado  increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992,  the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for  whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000)  (Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from  1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases  increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.

Surveillance and Information Systems Br,  Div of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for  Prevention Svcs, CDC.   Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992  may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more  complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH  surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea  cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories  suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact.  However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning  laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the  gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.       One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in  Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a  recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs  (2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area  coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires  further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated  previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6)  -- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom  gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs,  and gang affiliation.       The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the  national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective  19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for  gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at  greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race- specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as  socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.       In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado,  interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting  partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at  increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black  males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in  schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted  primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to  perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational  interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of  members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders  and health-care providers.

Child safety seats and safety  belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50  states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety  belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by  an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major  cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of  occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for  those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In  addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to  use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between  adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints  for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC  analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  (BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this  study.       Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to  18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based,  random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury  Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499  (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent  was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for  that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in  this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than  consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up).  Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software  for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates  and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined  by p values of less than 0.05.       Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six  (Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no  law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania,  and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a  vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse  of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary  enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a  safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states  used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use.  The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law  requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law  (no-law states).       Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not  consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and  adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square  test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus  43.2%, respectively).       High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1  year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than  consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported  high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age  (range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for  adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child- occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1%  for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of  consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult  safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age  groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).       Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded  that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition,  higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with  increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated  with increased adult safety-belt use (8).   Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National  Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others  indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely  to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these  nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit  other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater  risk for motor-vehicle injury (10).       Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with  child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs  should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low  educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such  programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve  low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are  directed at parents with young children.       Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In  addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment,  those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do  not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety  belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and  safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may  increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers --  the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the  highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES                                IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC                          AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88        Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance  systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance  in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for  the years 1983-1988.       Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program  and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population- based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The  prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983- 1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan  Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race,  sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.       Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal  alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the  kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general  diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand  limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are  probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these  defects are relatively easy to diagnose.       Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy  termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However,  the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be  related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene  pool, or random variation.       Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several  collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in  the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on  the impact of prenatal diagnosis.

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89       Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza  virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually  from October through May.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance  conducted from October 1988 through May 1989.       Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices  of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO  collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza  viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and  territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians.  Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received  throughout the year.       Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B  viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency  overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted  over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices  of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were  similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of  identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype  increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the  1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were  reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza  A(H1N1).       Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of  influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the  importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since  amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.       Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced  throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make  informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual  surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates  for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.  Authors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona                   High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies  Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF- ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been  developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT),  embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together,  these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive  technology (ART) procedures.   Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or  pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility  management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to  proceed with one of the ART procedures.   Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility  service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and  Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in  ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients  in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the  traditional therapies.   The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our  Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the  realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are:   o in vitro  o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube    transfer  o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation.  This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed  towards improved success of these technologies.

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then  subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA  amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization.   There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by  other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and  hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ  hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of  which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit  sex-linked disorders.   The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that  it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility  of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth  of affected children.

In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our  Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of  unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and  the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred  to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under  strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being  processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our  andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to  perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically  stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing  hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo  lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs  obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic  egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia,  we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our  Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.        Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal  deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male  factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall  success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per  cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173  IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.       Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is  disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological  factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well  recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous  ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle  attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant  of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an  Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of  traditional therapies.       The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not  been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs  available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates  significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years;  and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is  unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our  Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may  be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that  fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant  proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently,  the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our  program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs  of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.        GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room,  usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves  introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian  tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization  occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF,  with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for  transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such  pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility  and/or idiopathic infertility.          The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990  indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained  with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36  percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might  expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our  program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while  substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the  patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing  a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing  general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from  obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs,  and the developmental competency of resultant embryos.       The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial  environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between  January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT  cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.       Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when  embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos.  This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for  success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical  issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated  by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from  both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs  should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.       Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new,  is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but  who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in  combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10  percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the  procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under  the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm  through enzymatic digestion.       Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10  percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly  relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm.  Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques  for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such  efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology  offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to  establish conception.

However, Miss Prophet is the leader of a group (The Church Universal and Triumphant) derived from the I AM group founded by a Mr. Ballard who began his mission in the 1930's (I am writing this from memory and may not have all the details straight -- for an old account, check your library for a bnook by Marcus Bach) after an eighteenth-century Frenchman appeared, tapped him on the shoulder, and offered him a cup of \\\"cosmic essence.\\\" A major tenet of the movement is that there is a monastery in the mountains of Tibet from which a monk descends to the lower altitudes every few centuries to preach, and that all major religions have been founded by monks from this monastery. Typically, the Ballard family and their successors, the Prophet family (related by marriage, if I remember aright), base almost all their teachings on messages they have allegedly received by telepathy from Tibet.

Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry during WWII.  3. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, children and elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last  four years.  The entire population of x-Soviet Armenia now, as a result of the  Genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people, are Armenians.   For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people  lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the  oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried  out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks  and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their  homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands  were empty of Turks and Kurds.   The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.  Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and  Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.  Today, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated  by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against  humanity.  x-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide  against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations  to the Turks and Kurds.  Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine  their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

Anybody know of such a gem?  Please Email me as I do not read this group often.\",\"         This seems a strange argument to make considering that Canada's violent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the U.S.  (Our non-gun crime rate is greater than their *entire* crime rate).  It would seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of gun control laws.         I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural and enforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and then that reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.          Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a crime with it a silly solution, it still doesn't address the question of Canada.  (Which is now, by the way, blaming their rising gun-crime rate on the U.S.  Strange that the border used to \\\"magically\\\" keep the guns out, but now isn't.)          The other side of the coin, of course, is that far \\\"illegal drugs\\\" are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally.  I've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals have shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources (stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simply see South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as well, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.           And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques of it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come to mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost entirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed for poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you compared the white majority they were virutally identical.          The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs. non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative conditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of nomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into account that the non-whites in either city were not living in the same conditions.          If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns, then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which are arguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far higher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly lower.           The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. \\\"inner-city\\\" problems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a condition which is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent crime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control is the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As one Canadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun control in 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase in violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparently they didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in the early eighties.          True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., where gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that crime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.         The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high or low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact violent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than it was going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by saying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be instituted to deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, you can't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of that gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control was implemented, just as happened in Canada.          As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent of gun control.          Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what others did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would sell to them?\",\" I'll throw in a vote for a Metzler \\\"economy\\\" tire, the ME77.

I came  home from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period  in order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was  the same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and  other things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first  cousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and  on the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring  that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.  When we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped  by a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus.  The driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus begins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to  the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking  passports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not  taken for Armenians.  We set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old  building where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was  packed with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th  Microdistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking passports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well. Then we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning cars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. \\\"Death to the Armenians\\\" was written on the cars.  When we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still quiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call  Baku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come.  Then there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to  come down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us to the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you  enter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was  beaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right,  that's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people  were being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very  long in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could,  looking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said  things now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a car on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that  they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that  there weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of  the building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later  found out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri Avakian was killed, too.  When the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go  home. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We  started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We tried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We decided she had already left.  We sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my father. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father's work brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our town. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get out of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address, but my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the call a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke down the door and came into the apartment . . .  They came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians  were. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we  could do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He  read the surname \\\"Danielian,\\\" turned the page, read \\\"Armenian,\\\" and that alone was enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the  courtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him,  pushed some of the keys on the piano and said \\\"your death has tolled.\\\" They  had knives and steel truncheons.  I had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that if I didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents  and said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded that we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken  outdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to push her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind  her. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began  beating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.  We are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their  balconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they  strike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I  lose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was the first one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are lying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from  their balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is  broken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an  ambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.  We were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and  try to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door,  they push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our  neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the  window to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a  result of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken  away. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken  away, and everything will be OK.  But they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the ambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received attention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12  o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with  some \\\"assistants.\\\" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives,  and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds on my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are  in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.  In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them Armenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only Azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events, before the 27th.  Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was  released, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first  they told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out  that they were dead. My father's older brother told me.  My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My  mother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the  leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.  They were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that their heads were smashed open and bled profusely.  At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out  later, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called  specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address  and dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address. Before the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the  phone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He  denies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father  answered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he  called from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of  automobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had  never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20  years old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he  was the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.  My parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was  two years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to go to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He went off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural  projects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and  later moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from  the village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in  a bookstore, and later, on a construction site.   My sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I always loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it was their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and wanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military School. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon- sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join  the Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life long--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it more than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School, and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.  Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home  of my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.  While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had suffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at their residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long time, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I also learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped  . . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too, about a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with his parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and his parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even came to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But in the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of others, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .  Today Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia, was shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to  recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. I was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of  Armenia.  After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give Karabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live peacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they can do that.  I arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches. After a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I  think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.  You can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno Karabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had  even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move  here for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and  that what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was wrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct  a mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies  in the hands of our government.

Welbon)]         For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?   There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses word \\\"on faith\\\", we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now. If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods?   The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing, rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?   I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found.\",\"   W/r/t performance, converter lockup is purely irrelevant.

The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots  of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now  defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.  The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the  SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they  were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.  About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once  in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as  Christ.  Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young  adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over  the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.  They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of  weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US  government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were  putting themselves in a self defense position.    In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn' t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.  If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the  local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you  some insight into where Koresh got his theology.\",\"   The case report of the first xenotransplant was published in Lancet 1993; 341:65-71. I can send you a reprint if you are interested. There was  another paper, sort of a tour of the horizon, written by Starzl and published in the Resident's Edition of the Annals of Surgery (vol 216, October 1992). It's in the Surgical Resident's Newsletter section, so you won't find it in the regular issue of the Annals. I don't have any reprints of that one.

We're looking for more than \\\"Well, the 2-pc is more versatile, but the     1-pc is better protection,...\\\"      Thanks in advance,    Nadine   What is best? Books have been written on that! But in regard to AeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs. If you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero dimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching the 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it. Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a difference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go somewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket) you can just detach and stow the pants.   One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for many women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and petite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better.   Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish I got 2-3 inches added to my pant legs.

Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library that adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite multimedia objects to be built from media objects.  Specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the source code for the original classes (though several configuration files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file).    Currently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN workstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.  Xavier has been tested in the following environments:  SUN:   Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC   OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later   C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1  NEC(EWS):   Machine : EWS4800/210,230   OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2   C++     : C++ Release3.1  It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from            interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/           (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)  We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier.

Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by  performing studies that are \\\"blind\\\" in various ways.  Some of these are:    o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a       placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the      control group or the test group.    o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects       receive a placebo or the test treatment.    o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects      receive a placebo or the test treatment.  Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to  differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on which it is based so that others can verify it.    It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because those who performed the study did not \\\"blind\\\" themselves.  It is not considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already are, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested, the control and test groups are treated alike.\",\"Does anyone know where Billy Taylor is?

The discussion is not about whether there were tanks   used in sixties riots; instead, it is about whether those tanks fired their   main guns in one of those riots.  You claim they did.  That claim is   ludicrous.  Awesley replied:      I repeated what I had been told, under what context I had heard it,   supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in Detroit in 67.  The issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It has been whether they fired their main guns.  You did not merely claim that tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress sniper fire and that they were \\\"quite\\\" effective at this.  You continue to back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is disputing.  Awesley went on:   I   spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was   down and they don't have a card catalog.  Anyway, it took about 10   minutes to find this in _Nightmare in Detroit, A Rebellion and It's   Victims_ by Sauter and Hines, on page 133, telling of the death of   Tonia Blanding, age 4.             \\\"When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction   the shots came from. [...] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the   tank belched fire into the buildings.  After a short round into the front   of the buildings, the tank guns spit again, tearing apart huge holes out   of the side of the apartment.\\\"           Well, it's not the main gun.    \\\"Well, it's not the main gun.\\\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you now going to admit that you were wrong?    will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main   guns?  Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will I read   the reports of the tank fire?  I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won't.    It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard   sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American   cities in the Sixties.  Awesley replied:     Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to   find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main   guns.  I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67 riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have been *big* news.  Awesley goes on:   You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since it makes your other claim seem more plausible.  And on:   I don't   expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and actually   do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know   what you find.  I already know what you found: nothing.  If I claimed that the Marines used F-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton, New Jersey would you believe me?  Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research it?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in?  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about it.  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer to live in reality.

The Jews were not trying to carve a territory out of Germany either, and except for small-scale resistance and a few larger uprisings, did not have an army or a government.

I have many anectdotes to prove my point,  but I'm sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can.\",\"[reply to Daniel.Prince@f129.n102.z1.calcom.socal.com (Daniel Prince]     Yes.     It seems to work equally well for CFS, another hint that these may be different facets of the same underlying process.     Yes.  The benefit is usually evident within a few days of starting it. Most of the patients for whom it has worked well continued low-dose amitriptyline, daily aerobic excersise, and a regular sleep schedule (current standard therapy).  Because of the cost (usually > $150/mo., depending on dose) and potential for significant side effects like corneal injury and birth defects, I currently reserve it for those who fail conventional treatment.  It is important that the person prescribing it have some experience with it and follow the patient closely.     As far as I know, I am the only person looking at it currently.  I should get off my duff and finish writing up some case reports.  I'm not an academic physician, so I don't feel the pressure to publish or perish and I don't have the time during the work day for such things.\",\"     What's the difference, in practice?  It amounts to your saying, it's disgusting but should be legal,  ***or***  someone else saying, let's allow the parties involved to decide what is disgusting.  Or, if you're like me, you think that it ISN'T a coercive law, because some children can't make informed consent.  Brian\",\" Devallano went earlier and more extensively to the Russian strategy than anyone else...and was the first GM to \\\"waste\\\" high draft choices on young Russians...Devallano would still be GM but he succombed to Demers pleading to make the Oates-Federko et al trade...which is the deal that sealed his fate.  Murray has made some decent trades...no doubt...but these are more due to the stupidity or cheapness of other teams than brilliance on his part...Washington was too cheap to pay Ciccarelli so they essentially gave him away...and Carson was really a big anchor to the team, and he was able to sucker a rookie GM to give him Paul Coffey for deadweight.  If Detroit still fails this year because he was one defenseman short... then he will have wasted an opportunity because Manson was available, and he was unable to pull the trigger.  It is his judgement that he has enough with what he's got...Yzerman doesn't have that many more years in his prime.\",\"Due to the resolution and size it is in 14 parts.  This is a uuencoded bitmap.  960X600 256 colors. The picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background. The size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 1024x768 display because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons to fit in without being on top of the picture. Reguarding image quality and resolution - I have not seen much better.  For those of you who haven't worked with pieced image files, here is how to put it back together.  1. save the 14 parts to 14 individual files  2. use a text editor to remove the header and footer     in each file.  3. concatinate all the parts into a single file  4. uudecode the file There are tools available to do this without the hassle such as uuconvert (UNIX) and UUcoder (Windows).  If neccesary I could post these tools or where to get them by FTP -- let me know. ------------ Part 1 of 14 ------------ begin 644 ROMAN.BMP M0DT:S0@``````!H#```,````P`-8`@$`\\\"``H,%4L*%DX2%G*E95(4'U9:8&% M@?HT-%T,,$A`55U]?>K*=769QLY(1,Y9<77*RLJJUN(P/%UI@8D8&%E(3%D0 M/%VZNKI55?)U@<[*JJH42&U$55DH*'&RVOH857T0/&$X4%6-KL:JSOH@>;:) MB>HT/%D42'%=7<Y$1'V9F?_*B8DL,%D858&=KO^-MKH<89&5H?_*:6DDA<HL M,%W*OKX8584\\\\2&%U<?I$0%DT-'$<896%H<X@;:7*G9V-I>)(684D>;8<89FA MI:65NM9QA;(@;:H\\\\2&G*?7UYB<8D>;IYD;8T1%G&QL9E=94HA<H01&504(59 M5?\\\\H)%W*LK*VMK9978E]A?I,55DHA<XP,&'&^OI$2%F)D?(44'G*D9%]F:%E M8?HP.%5(885,68FAMOIM>;+*<7'*QL:VXO\\\\878V5G>Y`4%UA<84<:9TX1%T0 M.%EU?<K*I:441&D<::$84'E`/%D@(%T@=;(X,%E,887*A84D@<*)F?(84'V^ M]OHX3%5(76EU=>(@*%!I;;(D(%4@=;8<78W*966AQNK\\\"PL(D@<;*NKJ1B?]] MH:5MA=XHC=8P0%D<79&RLK)5685]>?HL+%T@::$\\\\/'&1D?+*F9F9LO^!E>I0 M4*6AH:$\\\\,%EM:>J5KN)A8;I(4%D\\\\1&6=LO;*>7EI=:ZZZOH,-%`X.%E$4&DT M-*&EOOH00&&=NNHLC=;*KJZZZO\\\\43'&5I?I9686ESMZRYNX00&5$/&6JVNX4 M3'7*C8T<'%G2^O^!D<X8685$1%EIA9D43'DX0%7*;6W*PL*VWOH868E`3%F^ MOKX<99DT2%5M:?](2'U588U(65TP-%D@<:K*H:&!H;8\\\\55FNKJY]?=HD?;H< M99TX0%V9I?^-KJZESNX@<:Y95=+*@8&1NKYM;<IA=7DD?;Y56:55896-KK(H MB<YUD9U077E096E$0*6RTOK*MK8X0&6^\\\\OI(4'FJQOJ9QL8HB=*9D?](2/(` M``````````````````````````````````````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`=]W=0$E)W4!W=W>%W=UWW7=)=W=`=W=W M2>-`A4!)2>/C=W?CA>-)=^-)22-WXTE)XTGCXX6%0.-)0$!)X^-)X^/C2>/C MXTE[X^/CXTGCX^/C>^/CX^/CBDF*24E[BN/7XXKCBN.*BN/CX^-[XXKCXWLR MX^/CBHJ*,GOC>S).>^/C,HI.XS**,GN*3GN*BDXRBHI8,GN*6(I8BHJ*BC(R M6(J*>S**BDXRBHI.,O/S3DY.Y_-.BN=.,HJ*6//G\\\\_.*,DY8YS)8Y_-8\\\\TY.

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the bottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the 46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have large, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get them :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the waist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece size that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's problems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and when I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).  I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are in some way different from us real folks.  Also, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands. I've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a store wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom in any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my sidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally leave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall down unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight), stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit), and run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be running errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...  As far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably equal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by 3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around the waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.  So I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit, I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I own.  Wouldn't go long distance without it.

Please send replies directly to umsoroko@ccu.umanitoba.ca \",\"In my postings I have made a proposal for comments and discussion. Those who don't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to do so.  However I would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass in a personal manner, legally responsible for their deeds. I cannot accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect threats.  PS: My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics. It has to do with the search for peace which would enable justice. I don't consider that justice is done, when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967 are not permitted to return to their homeland. This can at best be called pragmatism, a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. It can never be called justice. And peace without justice will never be peace. It is my conviction that the situation in which a state, through the law, attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as Israel does), is not normal. Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than Western democracies, such as the United States, in which Jews are free to marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may have drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just to compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day will come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society, in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic affiliation of its constituency, such a Fund would not be needed any more. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their traditions, why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state. Western democracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that most American Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed Christian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW.  I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional, infantile outbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect Judaism are uncivilized. Such behaviour is not good for Judaism.\",\" Jim, please, that's a lame explanation of the trinity that Jesus provides above. Baptizing people in the name of three things != trinity.

But of course I knew that because it is so easy to do.  There is not a single doubt in my mind that every byte that passes every significant gateway or 'bone is captured for the colligation of data about __________?  (Maybe your name is here).  Maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted  posts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared private key.  For example at the coming up Cypherpunks meeting, a private key corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out by a moderator.  Minutes, followup comments to other participants, and so on could be posted to the alt.encrypted group for the use of the people who attended. Communiques intended by the group for non-attendees could of course just be signed using the private key but otherwises not encrypted.  Starting a alt.encrypted newsgroup rather than just maintaining mailing lists is better for several reasons.  First, it would be easier to archive for people who might join a group \\\"late\\\" and who might like to easily read earlier posts; second, traffic analysis to know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled; three, a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicize available privacy measures on the internet.  And it would be fun to accumulate a secret keyring full of such keys -- it beats giving out t-shirts as a door prize.  We could send a copy of alt.encrypted directly to Judge William Sessions or Admiral Studeman to save them the time of having it collected for them.  \",\"  not a flame, just a point:  I'd be scared at 130 here, not because i feel drivers who are STUPID.

Everything seems to work fine except for the Windows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit modes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup, and within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally unintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire about this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it was version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I'm simply amazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).  One very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none of the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers for Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I've been running a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have \\\"Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer.\\\"  Anyway, I just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about it.

I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think  the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).  I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version,  improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88)  although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on  Cirrus's part but I don't think so.

This day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy U.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.  The short version is that his testimony was consistent with the opening statements for the prosecution.  Cooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington) on August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation with five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was using night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up into two teams of three people.  The six later met at an observation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies Cooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to scout further possible surveillance sites.  Cooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into a gully to see, \\\"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\\\" Striker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking loudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.  They ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the \\\"fern field\\\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance team had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy target and might be \\\"shot in the back.\\\"  As Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the road from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.  At this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \\\"fend him off with his gun.\\\"  [It is unclear whether this means he clubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then took cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not noticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan got up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \\\"Stop!  U.S. Marshal!\\\"  Harris then \\\"...brought the weapon around at hip level and fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw Bill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\\\"  Cooper fired at Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon to bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then heard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the direction of the shots, yelled, \\\"You son of a bitch!\\\" and ran toward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him from directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the cabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward the cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two fingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and then his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the other three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.  On cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of throwing rocks into the gulley, asking, \\\"You wanted to lure that dog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?\\\"  Nevin also pointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had claimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him. Cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and decided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the cross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at him [no answer was available].  Friday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.  Notes: There was no coverage of protestors.  Drew ============================================================== \",\"  Hmmm, this gave me an interesting idea.  How about this argument:  1)  Second Amendment gives us the right to keep and bear arms.  2)  Strong cryptography is \\\"arms\\\", according to the U.S. government (that's     why it's so hard to export).  Therefore, we have a constituitional right to strong cryptography!   Q.E.D.  However, it's likely to be as hard or harder to exercise this right as it is getting to exercise the other rights that the government is slowly restricting.  Maybe the NRA _would_ be the best existing organization? (Although I think a new one might be better, but perhaps would take too long to start up.  I would certainly join.)\",\" The \\\"so sacred it's secret\\\" explanation is a bit misleading.  While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.   There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).  Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \\\"You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you\\\" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.   But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few:  1. \\\"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given\\\" (Matt. 13:11).  2. \\\"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\\\" (Matt. 19:11).  3. \\\"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\\\" (John 16:12).  4. \\\"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father\\\" (John 16:25).  5. \\\"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\\\" (1 Cor. 3:1-2).  6. \\\"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face\\\" (2 Jn. 1:12).  (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.   Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------          Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City                     jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu\",\".d. .d. I just thought of another one, in the Bible, so it's definately not because of *lack* of religion.  The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for other reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy and peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions  lying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice, peaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to mind...  I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally intended for.  That doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in the Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own stomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to kill by their leaders.  The point is that there are many things involved in religion that often lead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant side effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching between Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.    @Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest parts of Man's history.@  Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological social caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs. The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to further their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these were groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more powerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples because there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over religion that he does not have many choices.

Ham rigs for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet  away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding. If you experience the problem frequently, it may be  caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio  transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire, etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.  If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them). Good instructions are included with the chokes.

I was referring to the fact that far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For much of the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point where long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note that the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh, Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.  \\\"When it's time to railroad, you railroad.\\\"     Not off the top of my head; I'll have to dig out my reference books again. However, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the Navigator's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and merchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be shared.     The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations can even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft), Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in 1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only a gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.   Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions asked. \",\" In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a project.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project.\",\"Hi  I am trying to implement a pointer feature in Xlib  I have multiple windows and all can take input and  show output simultaneously on all other displays  I want to implement a pointer feature   I would like to get the pointer to come up on all windows once  I choose pointer in the menu and every one should be able to see it  Can you give me some hints as to how I should proceed    replies will be greatly appreciated\",\"     Hey, sounds great.

Wait a minute. S&K did NOT compare trends.  If they did, they would have seen that the advent of Canada's gun law had no effect on homicides, total or handgun.  Without a pre- vs. post comparison, one cannot speculate as to the utility of anything.  All they have is a correlation, and correlation DOES NOT prove causality.    Hold it again. You dismiss a point about demographics, then you ask about socio-economic demographics? Very slick.  Once again, correlation does not prove causality.  Looking at pre-vs. post data, the Canadian gun law had no effect.   Sir, if you were a Canadian, and owned a gun before the restrictive gun laws were passed, and decided to hide it rather than turn it in, would you answer truthfully a question about gun ownership from someone who calls, writes, or asks you on the street?

Asante EN/SC adapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the newest drivers from Asante's ftp server.  The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain - specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac tests memory, etc. Just before the \\\"happy Mac face\\\" normally shows up, the power light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the Asante box pretty much unusable.  It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed during the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has *never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had it for over a year).  Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk -- several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator (both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal resistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another identical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages.

The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.  A merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri  town of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to  have taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military  operation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the  Armenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been  massacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten  and shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed  the Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian  insurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the Karabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City  hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant  were killed.

Anybody knows compression-algorithms & -factors for voice ?  I've posted some info on CELP coding on sci.crypt.  Looks like you can squeeze speech into 4000bps if you have a fast enough computer like a sparcstation (or a Newton with the Acorn Risc Machine in it :-) )  This drops the bandwidth to so low a figure that it's feasible to run speech over tcp/ip running on top of slip down a v32bis modem.  Not only will this let us run point to point encrypted speech, it'll let us run speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us by getting *very* heavy about regulations.  The thought of this, if the administration realised, would probably scare them shitless.  Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol for internet speech *damn fast*, allowing anyone who feels brave to inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our workstations.  Shouldn't be too difficult.  The CELP stuff is standardised, we use tcp/ip streams, and a protocol allowing silences to be used to catch up on any net lag, and also to avoid sending any data during silences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end because any net delays would add up to big voice-lags)  As for me, I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone. It'll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night :) (whether encrypted or not)  You know, surely *someone* is working on this.  Who?  It's so obvious, why doesn't it exist already?  I've only seen netphone for Suns and it didn't do the CELP compression so was restricted to ether connections.\",\"        Mr. Parsli, I have to take exception at this.  There are verifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments abusing gun-control restrictions.  I don't think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye future.  After so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the stove.          I'd love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell pork back to their constituents, there's not a lot I can do.           It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust the government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed to do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies total government power.   I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.          This is very likely.          The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many people would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're here.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is necessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should have always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't. Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more magical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more heavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.          No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S., two-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide rates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about half the per-car death rate.         The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  The fct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody, whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent.        Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.        Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even if we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.           In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms. (50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per  se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's countries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got more knives or fists.           In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S. have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms of prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they are doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is  violent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The *vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of 99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that you can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.          The situation is not \\\"good\\\" in that people fear for their lives. But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots, protecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they, too, lost their livelihoods?          The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't. However, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can be appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition won't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.         You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If you're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully simply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough, as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)          45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun. That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans. Firearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the group *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.         You may take that for what it's worth. \",\":  : And, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been traded,  : resigned, or been striped of his title during the season?

Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me, I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.  Very little sugar or salt.  Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)  My \\\"clean your plate\\\" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last 10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch up, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.  I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry shortly, and eating won't be practical then).  I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to stores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car. I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes runs in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle.)  There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately, it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.  Obviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've done will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who did try it and didn't succeed.   I'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat. I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty, my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes off again over a week or two. --  Keith Lynch, kfl@access.digex.com\",\"<MUNCH!>  It would be funny if it wasn't so damn *NASTY*; and as non-xian as I am,  it's hard to believe that someone is pushing black is white and freedom is slavery so blatantly.\",\"[why do babies get diseases, etc.]   Here's the (main) problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably  consistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does not support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by latest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for about 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at most) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before there were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease... mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just fossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what brought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then how could it exist before humans?  [deletions]   Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about biology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off' in perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a collective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the degeneration of the genetic code'.    Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But it still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as much damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even when people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed', (forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and died off for lack of nearby hosts.  I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few hundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to be getting less nasty w/age...    Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right? And, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It seems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift humans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less lethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems, imperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us by God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made our immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases?    Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the phrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect' system would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system that will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a perfect system. At least, IMHO.  Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the original genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart? If so, why could God not have used better materials?  Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself, of did It just choose not to?  [deletions]   My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for the explanation you give. (At least, that I'm aware of.)

FACT SHEET        PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT  The first thing it doesn't say is \\\"We're giving you stronger encryption\\\". what it says is     the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only    provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust    than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of    the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the    escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to    encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization. But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now, so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break! *At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search for the other 40-bit key.  Similarly, it didn't say \\\"We're making encryption is commercially available.\\\" because encryption *is* already commercially available, including forms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA. And phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.  The next thing it didn't say is \\\"We're making encryption legal\\\", because of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the President can't change the First Amendment merely by decree. What it *did* say was:  In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the  private sector from developing, or the government from approving,  other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in  assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system. which clearly means \\\"We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys. Soon.  Once business buys into this.\\\"  Another thing it didn't say is \\\"We're going to ask Congress for money to do *lots* more wiretapping\\\", because of course, there's a budget crisis, and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash. What it *did* say was:    The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to    the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct    lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure    law enforcement communications.

And since the nation is nominally based on the Declaration of Independence which states that \\\"all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness\\\", it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definition of humanity. \",\"      Now doesn't this sound a lot like the \\\"colorful (or otherwise) story       from antiquity that somehow tries to (or does) explain natural pheno-      mena\\\"?

Some reported pincushioning   (the problem I had), others poor focus, etc, etc.  I complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (I dodn't even pay shipping) and returned to me in 2 days.   It's now clear, well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel distortion at all. I'm very happy with it, and the digital controls and mode memory are nice.

I don't have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:  1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have  to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too  ignorant to know I need to buy)  2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in  about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a  motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes a difference)  3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?  4)  In DC, as I imagine it is in every other state (OK, OK, we're not a  state - we're not bitter ;)), you take the written test first and then get a learners permit.  However, I'm wondering how one goes about  learning to ride the bike proficiently enough so as to a) get a liscence and b) not kill oneself.  I don't know anyone with a bike who could  teach me, and the most advice I've heard is either \\\"do you live near a field\\\" or \\\"do you have a friend with a pickup truck\\\", the answers to both of which are NO.  Do I just ride around my neighborhood and hope for  the best?  I kind of live in a residential area but it's not suburbs.

Some say that if the two have : publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and : are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective : qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.  The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically* married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.  e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall leave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh'' (Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).  If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the phraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This implies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the point of intercourse.  Compare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary was pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were *betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which required a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary and Joseph went to bed together.  Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is described as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes  place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with Jesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will take place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse, because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.  In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is not marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the point when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the civil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.) Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a marriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since Napoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be corrected on that point!)  This view obviously raises some questions:  What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering marriage. Are those people also ``married''?  If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours the laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God- honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and also to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)  --   ----- Michael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)\",\"I appreciated the follow-ups and replies to my earlier query.  One reply, which I have lost, suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses, one  of which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan.  By coincidence, last week's _America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles  Bourke, Corpus Christi's pastor emeritus.  Fr. Bourke also directed the NT  translation in the New American Bible.  He noted \\\"...certain practices have  been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality,  and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy.\\\"  I note that at my  parents' parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the  offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word \\\"risen\\\".  This was not a  kiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 Mass.  I wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies.  This newsgroup as a whole offers generally moderate (perhaps because it's moderated) conversation on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself). Sometimes people do go over the top, but the remarkable thing is how that is the exception, I think.  Benefits of the doubt are generally granted.  It seems so...Christian?\",\"We here at Utah State University Cooperative Extension have been using W4Wg for a while now.  We wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway.  You also need a tcp/ip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that's what they require to get the smtp gateway to work.  You need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff.  We do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do.    There is a glitch somewhere in the system though.  I don't know if it is MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to a Unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mail is routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail. Most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha. Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying \\\"Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)\\\".  If you can stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.  The system people of course say that the VAX is not the problem, the gateway is probably the problem.  If anyone wants to get help it is only $175.00 for one support call. (until problem is worked out)  Phooey to that I say.  I am looking vigorously for a better Idea.    If you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew,  please drop me a note - anyone.

Thanks,   Davebo \",\"By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff  At 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer. Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues.  The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3. With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit playing.  They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired.  ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\\\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.  If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry's anger.  ``It wasn't pretty at the end,\\\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but it did.\\\"  Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium.  The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.  The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.  ``It's a shame we let down,\\\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\\\"  Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won, and that's all that matters,\\\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\\\"  Some players didn't have a problem.  ``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\\\" said Rich Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.  ``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\\\"  Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow, he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.  ``I didn't know it was final,\\\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs, and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end.\\\"  The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.  ``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\\\" Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\\\"  If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.  Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then, Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.  With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.  Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.  Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the  rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend.  Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.  ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\\\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and I know he was watching. I know he's happy.\\\"  Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later, making it 5-1.  Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.  Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period.  The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there,\\\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\\\"\",\"Does anybody have informations about the   W 86 C 451   and  W 86 C 456 chips (40pin DIL pckg)?  They are build in a multifunction io-card for pc.

The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \\\"The Abyss.\\\"  Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at  the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation  whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it  was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if  someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There  were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that  large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well  mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an  Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that  they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do  to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded  a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move  over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone  recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina.  It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats.  Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis,  people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the  auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and  gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \\\"OK, we've  scared them enough, let's leave.\\\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to  me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of  \\\"anasha\\\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like  they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing  had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful  films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We  could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine,  and it was dark . . .  Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting,  something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially  listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to  make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation  wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,  policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors  there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some  naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well,  since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super  serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we  live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the  driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and  he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well,  OK . . .  So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was  happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation  was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \\\"Ka-ra-bagh,\\\" they're not going  to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had  come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to  cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma  down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though  nothing had happened.  That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and  didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't guess.  On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda,  Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and  no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that  morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda  Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, \\\"Don't they want Armenians? Well what  are they after, if they're already in that state?\\\" She says, no, nothing like  that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The  cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.  Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy  problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, \\\"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\\\" Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home  and told Mamma. Mamma said, \\\"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on.\\\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I  tell Lyuda, \\\"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see  you out.\\\" Mamma says, \\\"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can  see what the situation in town is.\\\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was  ready. Mamma says, \\\"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\\\" We sat down at the  table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything  out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television, and the show \\\"In Fairy-Tale Land\\\" was coming on.  We cleared the table.  We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't  see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people  . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's  an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story  buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20  people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see  several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not  killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of  the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their  feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in  general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not.  I become terrified and go home and say, \\\"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \\\" Then the crowd  runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and  starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors  are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is  shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it  turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and  kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop  them.  They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the  windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard,  and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't  crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey  Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear  tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous  din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were  shouting Father's name, \\\"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\\\" or something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma  says, \\\"Into the bedroom, quickly!\\\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part  of our dowry; Mamma says, \\\"Hide there, they probably won't come in there,  they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\\\" She says, \\\"We'll tell them  that we live alone here.\\\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in  the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say  that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I  can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak  Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told  her anything or not.  Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, \\\"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened.\\\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \\\"Get out of the apartment, leave.\\\" I  say, \\\"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the  apartment.\\\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, \\\"There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!\\\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts,  commanding them: \\\"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\\\"  And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start  undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there,  in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how  much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The  atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among  themselves who would go first.  Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding.  He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It  seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, \\\"Well, we're done here.\\\" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs  . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the  window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the  windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking  about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong  person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be,  which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they  don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I  humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing  . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.  I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't  know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by  my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings,  something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death  come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What  happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.   I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me  clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember  that I said the same words over and over again: \\\"Mamma, what happened, Mamma,  what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\\\" I can't make  sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all  went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his  courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though  he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he  served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor  brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,  \\\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\\\" How do I know who's who  and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when  they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda  said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going  to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's  hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our  sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding  on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in  there. So they survived.  My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back  up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed  there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put  it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and  knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \\\"I'm not going to let you  in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings  and we'll leave the building.\\\" Lyuda says, \\\"I'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\\\" It was just for a  moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came  back to our place and lay under the bed . . .  I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone  number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he  came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were  simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,  it was hard to breathe . . .  My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our  administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary  passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right  after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a  great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not  only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next,  without stopping. After us.  I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young  Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.  Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in  Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \\\"Run quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\\\" At that moment  three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,  there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything  out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to  scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you  here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of  the soldiers said, \\\"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the  Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\\\" So at that point the  Daghestan police were there.  When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously  injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they  were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda  and me and said, \\\"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't  know what to do with the rest.\\\"  So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My  boss said, \\\"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens.\\\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She  examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait  ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People  called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.  That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself,  \\\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\\\" She looks me over and  says, \\\"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things.\\\" And I think, great, I have to deal  with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this  condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't  have the energy to say, \\\"How could our people possibly be smart enough to  think of something that yours haven't already done?\\\" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her  own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next  morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything  more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,  nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at  them.  I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \\\"Better to ask  your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can  better explain what happened.\\\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw  themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward.  Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me  clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress,  but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up  above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \\\"I can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\\\" I went back to my  ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and  brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I  couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one  had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . .  Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should  be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an  Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must  have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something  else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.  The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,  and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many  troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw  a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought  that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait  after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't  come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.  I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm  me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw  a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each  other and asking, \\\"What happened, what went on?\\\" Two days later they came to  see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed  interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they  could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues  who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,  neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what  happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart  . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came,  not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part  of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I  lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be  from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of  insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful.  There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took  me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were  emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's  friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic.  They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasn't cut.  They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon  appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not  talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \\\"We  demand that Seidov come!\\\" The response was, \\\"It's Seidov who sent us.\\\" Seidov  is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said,  \\\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same  things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you  agitators.\\\" And so on. More of them said, \\\"Have Seidov himself come.\\\" This  went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us  out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because  they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The  smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who  had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a  club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay  to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day  someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie  theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it  was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants  took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in  Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to  mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting  right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only  the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women  were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come  any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered  together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie  theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to  the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and  couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently  they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my  eyes.  Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \\\"Aren't you an  Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\\\" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in  nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs.  So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't  spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered  the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only  the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself,  she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the  building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children.  This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were  already in the city.  They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire  families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't  see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult  now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify  the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard  that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people,  including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3.  They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who  had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were  going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply  savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did  what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that  hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from  the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the  ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and  she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and  beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that  whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and  carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.  I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of  people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a  song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has  that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,  the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They  couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face.  I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had  talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the  Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met  with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint  meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of  those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.  They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were  dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch  me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these  people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan.  The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was  there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't  recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, \\\"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\\\" He turned away  and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina  anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out  anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became  myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people  there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his  name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one  we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \\\"If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his  alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not  responsible for my words.\\\" He said, \\\"What did they do to you, how awful,  myself, I hid an Armenian family.\\\" Then after some time goes by he comes back  again and says something entirely different: \\\"I wasn't at home, my family and  I went to Baku.\\\" I said, \\\"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before.\\\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is  being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me  that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.  What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the  head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an  insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the  same time  I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I can't say.                                                       When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it,  because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it  always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my  face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed,  they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41,  is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ  dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our  building was killed, it was that man.  A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come  over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was  all over, people started making announcements in town saying that  investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now  they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he  himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy  came to the plant and said, \\\"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the  bus station on Saturday at ten.\\\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do  you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent,  probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go,  because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had  killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of  that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that  the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from  I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word  I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an  Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know.  His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from  Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time.  His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani  KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many  photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at  curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this,  the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a  haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he  is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did,  I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment.  At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,  all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, \\\"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like  you.\\\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything  without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when  she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had  all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.  They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that  moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the  faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the  apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and  no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have  anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the  apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the  apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they  know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the  building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis  lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our  apartment.  I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt  when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from  our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \\\"Karina, we  saw all of it, how could it happen?\\\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to  me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been  able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani  woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated  woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two  Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She  came down to the entryway and said, \\\"You'll come in this entryway over my dead body.\\\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some  folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't  even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They  couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani  stopped them.  They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place  they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the  apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that?  Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is  some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed  to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had  come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They  screamed and screamed: \\\"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\\\"  Only they didn't shout \\\"kill,\\\" they shouted \\\"gurun ermianlary.\\\" Gurun  literally means \\\"kill,\\\" or \\\"destroy.\\\"  That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their  kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part  of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . .  A boy said to my mother \\\"Where's the gold?\\\" Mamma said he must have been 12  to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the  Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the  fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where  the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a  little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to  wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were  bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and  Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth,  bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had  shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and  tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having  trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and  started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted  to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by  accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,  \\\"What's happened?\\\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \\\"At least go and  find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or  murdered them, at least bring the corpses.\\\" He went looking for us. At that  moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that  someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out  from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought  she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to  herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from  under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that  way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled  down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it happened in.  And Mamma said, \\\"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting  something or other, and running toward the other building.\\\" It had more or  less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I  tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \\\"Listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how  long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\\\" I don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe  not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \\\"Mamma, what do you need any of that  for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\\\" She says, \\\"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the  night at someone else's.\\\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were  coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He  shouts, \\\"Come back, they're coming!\\\" They didn't have enough time to get a  lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my  knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his  wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to  leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,  they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building,  maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished  building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more  or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.  Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there,  something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even  live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and  mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television.  They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \\\"My  God, what is going on around here? When will this end?\\\" We turned off the  lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who  knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but  they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that  he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his  apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up  at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, \\\"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us.\\\" He went upstairs, and they say, \\\"Aren't you taking anything from this  apartment?\\\" He says, \\\"I don't need anything.\\\" And the women who were standing  in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were  standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the  first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time  to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty  pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really  mad, and he says, \\\"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\\\" They tell him,  \\\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\\\" He ran off in that direction.  Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms,  there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They  just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man,  she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told  me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them,  the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \\\"Where's the girl who was here?\\\" And he became furious. The woman tells him, \\\"She came to . . . \\\" She didn't know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \\\"She came to and went to the basement.\\\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the  whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took  flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been  standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there  to get me. Then one of them said, \\\"There's so much water down there, she  probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in  the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\\\" I didn't know that, and  when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't  just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .  After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really  didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and  started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all.  Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people  who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think  that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but  they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole  brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\\\" That's  all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not  one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were  standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women  that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for  one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,  an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom:  if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed  to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \\\"If you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\\\" So she left. That trick didn't work on them.  Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget  that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,  then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister.  And no one did anything. Anything.

It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.    It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9.

As early as 1934, K. S.  Papazian asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians          'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1]  At that time, he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would actively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World War II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of Turkish population of eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before the outbreak of the Second World War.  In 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted in the 'Hairenik Weekly:'   \\\"The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall   see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations  and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to  the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are  strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race.  On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is  bereft of social sanctities.\\\"[2]  [1] K. S. Papazian, 'Patriotism Perverted,' (Boston, Baikar Press    1934), Preface.

Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.  WE have to take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws and rules only to better their positions within the government.  WE have allowed them to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation has to be changed.  Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact with the Devil himself.  It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are motivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  And having no easy way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more incentive for the agencies to take property.  It's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that Clinton would have the \\\"plumbers\\\" out in force shortly.  Clinton and his henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control.  Anytime a leader believes in that, the leader will use every means possible to retain that control and take more.  WE have to take OUR government back.  Otherwise we will end up living in the equivalent of a high-tech third world dictatorship.

Even if what you say about this local Pittsburgh guy is true, it is not logical or fair to conclude that this is true of all doctors who treat Lyme disease.  By your logic, I could conclude that all of the physicians who consult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits to Lyme patients are doing it for the money, rather than because they believe they are encouraging good medicine.

For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.  Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour).  Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more (although that would be a lousy way to control it).  What I would like to know is:  1: Are the above guesses correct?  2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?    (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm    too fast when I unplug it)  3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier.

The pull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-cold weather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. Locate the fast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a normal idle. If so, locate the diaphram and test it. If you can't apply suction (via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose) with your mouth that will cause the diaphram to retract, then it's bad and should be replaced.\",\" Hi there I'm suffering from Sarcoidosis at present.

However, there are those who use the church to bolster themselves.  This is evident in many letters.  For instance, Paul talks about the \\\"super-apostles\\\" to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11-12), he mentions how people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12), he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will abandon the faith and teach lies (1 Timothy 4:1-3) and that some will search for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 Timothy 4:3-4). Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them (Matthew 24:4-14).  But look at the promise in this last part.  Verse 14:  \\\"And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\\\"  Even today, there are false teachings.  I can name two which I am well familiar with:  the non-need of baptism and the \\\"praying of Jesus into your life for salvation\\\".  Both are taught.  Both are DEAD wrong.  They have been taken out of context from some verses, interpreted from others, and just plain made up.  The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33.  He then commands baptism in Matthew 28:18-20.  The church Jesus founded, though, is alive and well.  It's not being persecuted as much as back then (the laws won't allow it yet), but it is being persecuted.

Belligerence, genocide, back-stabbing,  rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the  Armenian history.

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and  Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses  each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin  June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours  per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.   Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact  Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below.   ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.        ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## #######################################################################               JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon  University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:  1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.

What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith (i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal revelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God  must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would  honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone  who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are  rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient  for them, or because they wish to spurn God.  I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one  holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is  that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with God.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or  revealed that truth.    --  comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\",\" I have the ARRL Handbook for the Radio AMateur, and I'm getting the Solid STate Design for the Radio Amateur.\",\"I have some used, but working, parts available for the original IBM laptop - the PC Convertible.

(One chip, one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks, and that break gives you all messages involving that phone.)     The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you nothing is an improvement, but notice that XORing with (truely random) bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents.  Using + for XOR, SK for the escrowed key, and A and B for two random bit strings, hand SK+A+B, SK+A, and SK+B to three escrow agents.

You're not good at math. But bear with me). A win is worth two points. So, getting two ties is the same as  getting one win. If your team played two games, won one and lost one, you'd have two points. If my team played two games and tied them both, we'd also have two points. We'd be tied in the standings even though our records are different.  Perhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again.

Surely you don't wish for the Democrats to destroy our beloved country just so your party can get some trivial political advantage? That's rather a petty way to think.

I couldn't stand the man, but I wish he'd done a decent job; if so, we might not be in the mess we are now, and that would be a small price to pay for suffering through another term of Republican control. Similarily, YOU should be hoping and praying that Clinton does a good job. Even if you're certain he won't.\",\"Hi !  I am interested in the source of FEAL encryption algorithm.

I do this as a service to the entire baseball world on USENET, especially for those in the East Coast who can't get final scores for West Coast games in their newspapers or late TV newscasts. This is helpful to fans in other countries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week. Also, many have requested for this kind of service previously but it was only available through BBS's or some pay news services. By the way, mine is free of charge and has no copyright restrictions.   Remember I only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the rec.sport.baseball newsgroup. Other than that, everything is done through private e-mail. Currently, there are 986 people on my mailing list that branches off into other mailing lists available for many others. And the list grows by an average of 35 people a day.  If people on USENET really don't want to see the postings I do to rec.sport.baseball on a daily basis, please just let me know. If the response is overwhelming against the posts, I won't do it anymore.   Thanks for your time.

There is a role for short chain fatty acids in patients with colostomies and rectal pouches that are inflammed (Short is butyrate and shorter).  There may be a role for treatment of UC with Short chain fatty acids, and I am looking  forward to the upcoming AGA meeting in Boston to see what people are doing.    You raise a hypothesis about the studies and restriction of other fatty acids.  You should contact the authors directly about that or even write a letter to the editor - it is a good point.

Even though my skin gets oily it really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry.   Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day vitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it   is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease  on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating meat).  Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with oilyness.   Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't be an infection afterwards.  Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).  \",\"Recently the following problem has arrisen.

Marvin Batty.\",\"Here are some ideas for those of you who want to oppose the White House Clipper chip crypto initiative.  I think this is going to be a tough measure to fight, since the Government has invested a lot of resources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They are serious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate Bill 266 in 1991.  Possible actions to take in response:  1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and more.  2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and technology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet, write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or newspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea.  Remember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be slow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and arcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one.   3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your Member of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US Senators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of technology issues.  Talk to those aides.  4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party would certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of the Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a surprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political spectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government that can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play themselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you want to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.  4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming these groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal expenses and lobbying.  5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be lobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a telecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then present your company's management with a united front of engineering talent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your management, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold meetings on it.  6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla techno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP, anonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers, etc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might also be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed by Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful tools for these purposes.   7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on this topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so we may have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't outright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of this Clipper chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared to analyze the Government's plan, and articulate how we want it modified. \",\"       I stand corrected.

God's love  is unconditional, unqualified, unfathomable.  We are capable of  rejecting God's love but He never fails to love us.  These verses do not show that God's love is qualified but rather that He  is opposed to evil.  I am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be  an innappropriate emphasis on Hell.  God deserves our love and worship  because of who He is.  I do not like the idea of frightening people into  accepting Christ.    I see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows God's love with  putting into words and explaining that love.  Preaching the Gospel  without living the Gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a  clanging cymbal.  Here's a question:  How many of you are Christians because you are  afraid of going to Hell?  How many are responding to God's love?\",\"If you are interested in (any of) the following, please contact me:         EMail           mbeck@vtssi.vt.edu         Phone           (703)552-4381         USMail          Michael Beck                         1200 Progress Street #5500E                         Blacksburg, Virginia 24060 ~~~~~~~~~~FOR SALE as of 12AM 4/16/93~~~~~~~~~~   1       PANASONIC AF X8 CCD OmniMovie Camcorder                 VHS HQ                 High Speed Shutter                 Flying Erase Head                 ca. 3 years old, but only used VERY lightly                 Date/Time stamp                 Counter/Memory                 Rec Review                 Fade                 Back Light                 Auto/Manual Focus                 Built in microphone/Jack for external microphone                 Comes with:                         Sturdy aluminum/hardplastic carrying case                                 (20\\\" long X 13\\\" wide X 6\\\" high)                         Shoulder strap                         Power adaptor/battery charger                         Battery pack                         Remote recording controller                         UHF/VHF ---> cable adaptor                         Audio/Video cables and adaptor                 Aproximate dimensions (measured around outmost features)                         15\\\" long X 4\\\" wide X 8\\\" high (w/ handle)                 ASKING PRICE:  $BEST OFFER so far $350, but looking for more                                  ($700 new price)   1       AMIGA 3000UX    25mhz, unix compatible machine w/100 meg Hard                 Drive, 4 meg RAM, no monitor, keyboard (ESC and ~ keys                  broken)                 ASKING PRICE:   $1500 OBO.   1       Hewlett Packard ThinkJet Printer w/ HP-IB interface                  Like NEW in original box                 ASKING PRICE:   $250 OBO.

That's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.  I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I deign from commenting much further.   Now hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as many other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that Christians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily being arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute, but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.    Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably* determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible human beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The  distinction is subtle yet important.  When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results are reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken, without sacrificing his convictions.  Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty. Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered, \\\"Cogito, ergo sum,\\\" yet we have not advanced much beyond that.  Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely certain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course, you have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all practical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with Christianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about absolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability  that they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do)  abandon these absolutes.   As I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does not mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to  render all doubts unreasonable. \",\"Hi...  I need information on scaring.

I asked in these groups some time ago what about the TC++/VE, and got no answers, so I decided to try. My brother who lives in the US bought and sent it to me, and I'm still trying to get used to it.  Before I put my good/bad points list, consider I am a Turbo Pascal/DOS programmer, and sometimes try to make something in Unix with C (just some exercises from university). I used to make some programs in Microsoft C version 5 (!!) because we used some third-party libraries that required that.  - I like Borland. It seems to me much more easier to use than Microsoft,   specially the debugger. I tried to learn Codeview sometimes, but never   felt confortable with it. - TC++ V/E seems very nice to create simple apps, like the examples on the   ObjectWindows book. So far, no problems. Lets see next week or so, when I   will try something more complex. - It works nice even in my \\\"weak\\\" machine 386/16Mhz, 6 Mb Ram.   But.....  - The manual for the Resource Workshop seems to be from a different version    from the Workshop itself. Some of the windows that appear on the manual   have more itens than in the manual. - I think I will run into trouble since I got this TC++/VE from my brother   as a present. I didnt wanted to buy the Japanese version because 1) I    suspect that the manuals will be in Japanese :-( and 2) I believe it   will be far more expensive here. So he bought it as a present and sent to   me, I send the registration card to the Japanese branch of Borland, but...   who knows.  So, I'd like to ask some questions for you all;  - I know that there are some Microsoft guys around here in this group. Is   there anybody from Borland ? Is there any e-mail address that we can    contact the technical support ? Not for stupid questions, but to ask   for example, why the RW manual seems to be different from the RW itself ? - Is there anybody else using it around here ? - Will the book of Petzold be useful for me ? I intend to use RW and ProtoGen   to make the interfaces and then work on the code itself.   Answers to my e-mail or comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools, please.

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call Japan, etc.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would greatly appreciate your sending it to me.

Hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.  De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er staat echter meer op stapel.  Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten 'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!  Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.  Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900.

As published in \\\"US Industrial Outlook 1993\\\"  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be \\\"adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.\\\"                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  \\\"Space Business Indicators\\\" in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year  through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request \\\"launch on demand\\\"  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/\\\"Spacelifter\\\" program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all \\\"ELV upgrade\\\" programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \\\"Spacelifter\\\"  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \\\"GO-AHEAD\\\"    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a \\\"Star Wars\\\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \\\"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\\\"     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst's report Morgan Stanley said \\\"We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.\\\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \\\"Aerokosmos\\\"  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \\\"Severkosmos\\\",  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one's a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \\\"the main  alternative rocket supplier\\\" for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of \\\"off the shelf\\\" components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the  satellite's communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \\\"Asiasat- 2\\\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based \\\"Asiasat\\\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's  aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \\\"made in Korea.\\\"   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

Around a million Americans every year defend themselves with firearms.  In many of these cases the defender doesn't even have to fire a shot!  The mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the deterrent that is needed.  I don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  But, taking away the right of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent crime problem in this country.  If honest, law-abiding citizens are unable to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will be able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling guns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns should be banned by the Klintonistas.   Statistics, por favor?   See my previous post.  That ought to set you straight.   People have the right to keep and bear arms no matter what the Constitution says.  That means that even if the 2nd Amendment is repealed the *people* (that's all American citizens FYI) will *still* have the right to keep and bear arms.

I was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs.       We here are *VERY* interested in info on R12 substitutes (in fact I  think we really need all the info on this we can get).      I would really appreciate technical, supply, and hardware-upgrade  details.       Also, R12 is a useful solvent/reagent in the extraction/production of  certain pharmaceuticals.  Any info on the substitutes' corresponding  usefullness?      I am currently working with the local engineers who are making sure  we are compliant with the regulations.  The trouble with regulations is  that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do, not what  you should do instead.       I think the cause of the new regulations is the Montreal Protocol  which has a definite CFC-phase-out schedule.  (Of course the cause of  the Montreal Protocol was all the research done on the causes of the  Ozone Depletion Problem.)       Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast  to ban the ozone-depleting (CFC) chemicals and not gasolines and other  greenhouse-gas-producing compounds.  The greenhouse effect (produced by  infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem  (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same  thing.  It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's  (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which  are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms.  Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help  the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem.   Fred W.

My system only had a IDE cable for one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors on it, and consequently have to switch cables.

But for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug in the cable to align these.   Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.

There are lots of them!\",\" I am told that Planned Parenthood/SIECUS-style \\\"values-free\\\" methods, that teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make \\\"choices\\\", actually _increase_ pregnancy rates. I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in \\\"contraceptive technology\\\" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.    Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't we teach \\\"safe drug use\\\" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it because we know that a class in \\\"how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs\\\" would increase drug use?  Why isn't \\\"drug abstinence education\\\" barred from schools because it teaches \\\"religion\\\"?  Aren't we abandoning those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe use?  \",\"What do I need to do to be able to run an NEC 3FGx in 800x 600 mode on my IIci?

Source: 'The Times,' 3 March 1992  MASSACRE UNCOVERED....  By ANATOL LIEVEN,  More than sixty bodies, including those of women and children, have  been spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh, confirming claims  that Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees. Hundreds are missing.  Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley  and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's  massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees.  From that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of  Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters  of Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their  own lines.  We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last  troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out.  They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov,  who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, flew to Stepanakert  to ease their departure.  A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their  dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the  same, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian  positions.  In all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another  31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures  do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed  the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night. The figures also  do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies  Zahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200  people shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came  by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and  of leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies  we saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents.  The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre.  All are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly  clothing of workers.  Of the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national  volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians,  including eight women and three small children. TWO GROUPS,  APPARENTLY FAMILIES, HAD FALLEN TOGETHER, THE CHILDREN CRADLED  IN THE WOMEN'S ARMS.

In this configuration, X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.     The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables.     Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?\",\"Can anyone tell me where to find a MPEG viewer (either DOS or Windows).

They are the depth that the dynasties had to win Stanley Cups.  They tend to be the very good second line guys- who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the NHL. They were all important to their clubs.  Probably, several of these Stanley Cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it were not for the depth provided by these players.  They compare to Rick Tocchet and Ron Francis of the Penguins.  Very good players who can lead lesser teams (Francis-Hartford, Tocchet-Philly) who provide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL.  As a defensive forward, there have been none better than Bob Gainey.  That doesn't mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the Canadians had at that time, but he was excellent at what he did.  Gainey could dominate games with his defence.  He didn't need to get goals to dominate. He shut down the opposition and was thus valuable.  There has never been anyone any better at doing this.

One might find oneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term that require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting a few weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with preferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.  2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects beside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to \\\"sell now and save on taxes.\\\"  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar advice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986), but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates (without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).  It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal economic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless pulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describe accurately what happens in the real world.  \",\"------------- cut here ----------------- University of Arizona Tucson, Arizona                                   Suggested Reading  Tan SL, Royston P, Campbell S, Jacobs HS, Betts J, Mason B, Edwards RG (1992).

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits  for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.   The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed  unsafe under federal air quality laws.        \\\"People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to  exacerbate that inflammation,\\\" said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental  Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  \\\"When people are on  the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over  the edge.\\\"       The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits  with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter  of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because  they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of  compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10  exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.        In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at  levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30  microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with  asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.        The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory  Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung  Association's medical section.        The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that  particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study  by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles  may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.   Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms  and bronchitis in children.        \\\"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\\\"  says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"But more and more research is showing that particles are  bad actors as well.\\\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate  air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated  pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex  and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  acid aerosols.        \\\"Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects  of particulate air pollution,\\\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"We have no way of  duplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \\\" Consequently, most of what  is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research  like the Seattle study.        Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur  dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any  time soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with  asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.      \\\"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only  cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's  rarely particulate matter,\\\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \\\"However, PM10 doesn't have  to be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\\\"                                HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993                 NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma  The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on  Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in  dermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance  techniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care  professionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological  characteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management,  and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi  and their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in  preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days of  presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel  weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement.    Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a  distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins;  (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential  for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical  excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and  extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4)  patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high  risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely;  (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for  melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education  and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality  from melanoma.

Within the program, there are four types  of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily  in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on  clinical research; \\\"comprehensive\\\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a  multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community  outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer  prevention and control research.    Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was  the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new  cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage  of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened  the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and  cancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew  progressively.    In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today,  there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria  for comprehensive status.    To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an  institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly  established in 1990, the eight criteria for \\\"comprehensiveness\\\" include the  requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in  several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong  program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings  into clinical practice.    Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly  beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also  referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting  the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass  strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials,  significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important  outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of  sources.    The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and  capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit  important new findings or address timely research questions.

These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers  engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators  and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications  from new discoveries in the laboratory.    Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and  clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently  incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their  overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today.    Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely  structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and  control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health  departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention  and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions  responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.   Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with  institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community  hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.    Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward  creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through  interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the  laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

The  decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to  test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of  Health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and   Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the  therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies  including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH  that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is  intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the   replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's  reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the  MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.   \\\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the  next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\\\" said Shalala.    Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine  Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had  convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested  simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of  multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two  years.  ==================================================================       HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  \\\"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV\\\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol.  114, No. 14, P. 18        AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was  approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome,  the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the  drug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that  although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk  of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit   disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of  the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the  drug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S.  researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials,  many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients  experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of   AIDS symptoms.

As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye  stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population  there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately,  the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass  graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed  what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.  The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of  oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot  officials and their violation of the co-founder status of  the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat  engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution  to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked  Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and  only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues  consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories  to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply  was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at  all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which  was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece.  Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish  population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population.  The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded Greeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their  autonomy in a separate republic.  Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would rather not be involved with the island. But, given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights, liberties and their very lives.

In case of the Earth z is about 23.5 degrees, I think. I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus, z is almost 90 degrees.  u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured. Paris is at about 45 degrees.  North pole is at 90.  a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from 0 to 360 degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun. The spring equinox occurs at a=0.  L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day). On the equator (u=0) L is always 1/2.  Near the north pole (u=90 degrees) L is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.  Computation: Define the auxiliary angles p and q by: sin p = sin a sin z cos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       (0 < q < 180 degrees)  Conclusion: L = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees) L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)  Wait!  But what is h? The cutoff function h is defined as follows:  h (s) = s    if  |s| < 1       = 1    if   s > 1       = -1   if   s < 1  As an interesting exercise, plot L versus a.   The graph will shows how the length of the daylight varies with the time of the year. Experiment with various choices of latitudes and tilt angles. Compare the behavior of the function at locations above and below the arctic circle. \",\"x>> x>>>> Fake convertible roofs and vinyl roofs. x>>>> Any gold trim. x > x>>>     These, I will agree, are abominations, right along with the fake x>>>continental spare-tire kit -- it's sad watching those little old ladies x>>>try to load their groceries into the trunk with that huge tire-medallion x>>>in the way. x>>>     Most pitiful fake convertible top: on a \\\"Cadillac\\\" Cimarron, with x>>>all the chrome door trim still visible -- not fooling *anyone*. x>>>Of course, there was that Hyundai Excel I once saw... x>> Least you think bad taste is something new: Back in the early 1970s I saw a couple of cars with *flocked* paint jobs.

For example, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a \\\"safe\\\" mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.    For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments \\\"turned off\\\" rather than just \\\"safed\\\".  Was it political (i.e. as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....    I've heard the argument that an active but \\\"uncontrolled\\\" spacecraft causes \\\"radio noise.\\\"  I find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed \\\"safe\\\" mode. This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a (week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth. At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be prepared if necessary.    As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it, great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal. By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.  I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit, exiting the solar system, etc).     Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby, etc) should consider designing in a \\\"pause\\\" mode in case their spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could have some kind of routine written in for the post mission \\\"drift\\\" phase.

COMPLETE:  I am thinking of a simple but fast molecular graphics program to write on PC or clones. (ball-and-stick type)  Reasons: programs that I've seen are far too slow for this purpose.  Platform: 386/486 class machine.    800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 VGA graphics   (speed is important, 16-color for non-rendering    purpose is enough; may stay at 800x600 for    speed reason.)          (hope the code would be generic enough for different SVGA           cards.  My own card is based on Trident 8900c, not VESA?)  What I'm looking for? 1) fast, very fast routines to draw lines/circles/simple-shapes    on above-mentioned SVGA resolutions.    Presumably in assembly languagine.  Yes, VERY FAST please. 2) related codes to help rotating/zooming/animating the drawings on screen.    Drawings for beginning, would be lines, circles mainly, think of    text, else later.    (you know, the way molecular graphics rotates, zooms a molecule) 2) and any other codes (preferentially in C) that can help the     project.

This week's MacWeek reports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August.  My guess is that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the price structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.  Your price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed for mine last month.  I would have rather waited for one of the new machines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of my IIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced me to purchase now.  I'm happy with the machine and won't feel betrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $1000 next week (heh).  Bottome line:  If the C650 does what you want, buy it.  If you wait until the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as well wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and then the units which follow them.  You may save some money but you've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the computer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuous state of flux.  At least they aren't going to try raising them again (grin).\",\"   Other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such..    Why not??

As Roger Lustig pointed out in a previous response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on a constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla, on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.  If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a different story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to hire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is an admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets game at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from baseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion, that's downright ludicrous.

As soon as you possibly can.  The difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally, any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  The remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from a wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (Occupational Safety and Health Service): \\\"Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and Rehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide\\\".  First, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands): (note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)    RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries   OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI   CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI   WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI   CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)   Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.   Pronation: Turning the palm down.   Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.   Supination: Turning the palm up.   Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.   Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.   Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.   Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.   Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.   Abduction: Moving away from the body.   Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.  Now then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse conditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles, tendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt. Diffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle discomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily \\\"the problem.\\\"  --- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory.  Normally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict the blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power, you're completely restricting your blood flow.  Without fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out, then they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates nasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.  Once one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the load.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow, and the cycle continues.  Another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves.  They need blood too.  Anyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor ergonomics, only make things worse.  --- Specific injuries you may have heard of:  (note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute injuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)  Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to cause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability to lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets inflamed, and you've got your problem.  Tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating, and can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more swelling, and more pain.  \\\"Sub-acute\\\" tendonitis is more common, which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse with repetitive activity.  Carpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include feeling \\\"pins and needles\\\", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation. CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.  Adverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere. AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS  disorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy  (brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).  Others: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for a way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS conditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you may have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).  ==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment  The most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax. If you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out the world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work: every three minutes take a three second break. EVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every three minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings, calm down, and relax.  If you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and relaxation are really a big deal.  There are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce inflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen your muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold contrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's best for you.  --- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was written in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from Appendix 10. -- dwallach]  . Let your shoulders relax. . Let your elbows swing free. . Keep your wrists straight. . Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward. . Keep the hollow in the base of your spine. . Try leaning back in the chair. . Don't slouch or slump forward. . Alter your posture from time to time. . Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.  Set the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There  should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees, and your thighs should not slope too much.  Now, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest.  Now, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in the hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area.  If you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning back, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.  [Now, I diverge a little from the text]  A good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, go find a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle, back height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in the way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good store and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you. In the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend \\\"Just Chairs.\\\"  The name says it all.  --- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:  There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some people, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you shouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your keyboard to be \\\"right there\\\".  If you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid pronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads may or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and look at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It's often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands.  Some argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today. Check out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.  ==5== Requests for more info  Clearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive is incomplete.  There's always more information out there.  If you'd like to submit something, please send me mail, and I'll gladly throw it in.  If you'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be wonderful!  I'd love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I'd love somebody to make a list of doctors.  I'd love somebody to edit the above sections, looking for places where I've obviously goofed.  ==6== References  I completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderful guide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health Service, a service of their Department of Labour.

Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView. I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage() is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the Sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that: (1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or (2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is, what is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to a window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is running on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck with XPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)?  All help appreciated...thanks!

Too damn many engineers doing way too little engineering.  \\\"He who sits on his arse sits on his fortune\\\"  - Sir Richard Francis Burton\",\"I'll contact you offline about this.\",\"    So I should be very comfortable that 500,000,000 people want to convert me to Islam. Or, to convert me to ANYTHING.   There are many types of violence, physical murder is only one.  'Trying' to convert is an insult. It's like trying to tell me that me and/or my God/my lack of God are just crap, that I need a new, 'converted' one.  This does not apply for muslims only, of course. Same for jews and for some friendly, nicely dressed neighbours who show on sunday with empty speaches and cheap booklets about some church ....  And when the objective is (I think, however that you are wrong) to convert  everybody, it's just a matter of time when violence will occur.   Aren't we able to learn anything from thouthands of years of 'conversion related violence' ?   Why not let 'the other, more inferiour' people live as they wish and take care  your business?. You do assume that they are inferiour (or their beliefs are) as long as you want to change their thinking.  \",\"  I think you are vastly oversimplifying things. We know that early Christians suffered totures because of their witness to Christ.  For example:  ACT 5:40    His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had             them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of             Jesus, and let them go.  ACT 5:41    The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been             counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.  It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion to even hearing Jesus's name. ACT 5:28    \\\"We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,\\\" he said.             \\\"Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are             determined to make us guilty of this man's blood.\\\"  Finally, the first apostle's death, James of Zebedee was certainly not by Rome's hand any more than the first martyr Stephen.     The problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection, then one must believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what He stood for and preached during His ministry on Earth.  That would have been extremely difficult for some people, especially those that had plotted to kill Him.   \",\"From:  Kayhan Havai # 1026 --------------------------                                                o Dr. Namaki,  deputy minister of health stated that infant   mortality (under one year old) in Iran went down from 120    per  thousand before the revolution to 33 per thousand at   the end of 1371 (last month).      o Dr Namaki also stated that before the revolution only   254f children received vaccinations to protect them   from various deseases but this figure reached 93at   the end of 1371.      o Dr. Malekzadeh, the minister of health mentioned that   the population growth rate in Iran at the end of 1371   went below 2.7     o During the visit of Mahathir Mohammad, the prime minister   of Malaysia, to Iran, agreements for cooperation in the   areas of industry, trade, education and tourism were   signed.
