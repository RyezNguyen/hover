A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U is derived deterministically from this serial number. That means that there are only one billion possible unit keys.     To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is    first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.    S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a    64-bit block R1:      R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .     Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and    N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]      R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .     R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The    first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The    rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2    are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow    agencies.  Hmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2 is an intentional way of assuring a \\\"fail safe\\\" for the government -- U is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not change they constitute effective \\\"master keys\\\" (along with F), the theft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities) completely obviates the security of the system. However, more interestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no matter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1 and U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space if it NOT to provide an additional back door?  I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on approximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on the back of a napkin.  Even if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is assuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the goal is an illusion of security.  If S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if they can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number pairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one understands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and, soon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via espionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well -- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but by the time we know it may be too late.     As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are    written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a    file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part    U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third    disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent    2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.    After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the    vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional    assurance that no information is left behind.  None of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of \\\"destroying the laptop\\\" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction. We all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turned off for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don't know is why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the first place other than to weaken the system. We don't know if the agents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their information -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make the bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing this in a \\\"vault\\\" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room with a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make high-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little for most of the rest of us.     The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the    room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,    and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to    the escrow agencies.  What would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and the NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always honest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because they have the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don't need to steal they keys as they effectively already have them.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\"Don't get fooled by exponents 2^80 (possible keys) is not in the same league with 10^80 (particles in the universe).  2^80 < 10^25.

On a typical UPS (well, on ours, anyway), there is NO switchover from AC to DC.  All the protected equipment is ALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual  condition of also having them on charge.  If the power fails, big deal -  the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but  there's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it  takes a while).  If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter, why not do it all the time?  Then there'd be no switchover to screw things up, and no having to sense the failure fast.  Just keep the DC on charge when the power is on, and it'll be there in zero time when you \\\"need\\\" it.\",\"I produced an error last week about CHORION:   I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from others, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do not feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in this example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research specifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not as tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am not competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns out that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \\\"Greek Lexicon\\\" renders each verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical order.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is far from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes things a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is indeed \\\"chorion.\\\"   Now I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:   \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Louw and Nida  \\\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\\\"  \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Grimm  \\\"Word study Concordance,\\\" Tynsdale  \\\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other    early Christian Writings,\\\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich  \\\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\\\" Perschbacher  In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:   A space, place, region, district, field, area, \\\"country place,\\\"   land, farm, estate, \\\"a bit of tillage\\\", and similar meanings.  Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about \\\"grave.\\\" As some of these  books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books  are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I  think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into \\\"contradictions\\\" to  be once again, as your friend said it, \\\"lacking in substance,\\\" and thus Archer  is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would  have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them to support Mr Archer's contentions).   By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of \\\"agros,\\\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word \\\"agros\\\" is defined as \\\"a field in the country.\\\" Chorion is specifically noted as a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly Bullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for \\\"field\\\" in Matthew (ie: agros) is different from the word for \\\"field\\\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and thus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already admit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity which drives the point home).   So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise (eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this  particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer questions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and  the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in discussing the \\\"Potter's Field.\\\"       Later,      Dave Butler\",\"  The big-bang model supposes a temporal singularity at the point of origin. There was _no_ time for a prior cause to occur in. If you want to invent fables for the surrounding context, fine, but one fable is only as good as any other.

Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield, now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime, he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't  know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field, he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important) was a absolute-primo-dick.    Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.    Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks  (Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been  a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.    You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers, simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you  blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one,  the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should  HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.  Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.    Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?    Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a  good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early 80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer :-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.  Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real stiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory, and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as SS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.    Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a \\\"mediot\\\"  candidate, pushed because of his \\\"winning attitude\\\" (a minor factor, if one at all), and his \\\"great defense\\\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.  SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris' \\\"ability to win\\\" which is nothing more than Morris' \\\"ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\\\".  At this point, Morris is an average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned  close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but not favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF \\\"consideration\\\".    Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about \\\"Yount and Smith being shortstops who  hung around a long time\\\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's  just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre... (Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)  Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY  tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the league.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.   This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it  or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.  I won't consider ANYONE who started playing after about 1985 (again, too early to tell.) [Note: these are all active players, I'm not counting recent retirees]  Baltimore:  Cal Ripken (should be a lock by now, even if Gehrig's record stands) Boston: Roger Clemens (might be a lock already, which is amazing), Dawson (?) Detroit: Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker (possibilities) Milwaukee: Robin Yount (discussed earlier) New York: Wade Boggs (possibly), Mattingly (long shot) Toronto: Paul Molitor and Jack Morris (possibilities)  Kansas City: George Brett (lock) Minnesota: Kirby (too early to tell), Winfield (lock) Oakland: Eckersley (lock), McGwire (too early), Rickey (lock), Welch (LONG shot) Texas: The Mighty Nolan [Too early to consider Canseco or Strange :-)]  Cubs: Sandberg (lock) St. Louis: Ozzie (lock), Lee Smith (probably) New York: Murray (almost a lock), Saberhagen (obviously, he's got to regain              past form) [And most certainly, NOT Vince Coleman, despite what he'll tell you :-)]  Los Angeles: Butler, Strawberry, and Hershiser are all long shots. San Diego: Tony Gwynn (pretty good shot) Colorado: Dale Murphy (a good shot), Ryan Bowen (just to see if you're awake)   [Before I get flames: this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list, there's probably a few deserving candidates that I left off, and, I didn't include Barry Bonds, Will Clark, Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher, Frank Thomas, Canseco, McGriff, etc. because I only considered guys who started playing before 1985)]   E-mail or post, I almost fear what I may have started here... \",\" ------------ Part 8 of 14 ------------ MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AYZ>8=#0T\\\"L!A%(!*]#0T\\\"4E)<-N;@+(U,C(;CZ;1-/3

There is a way.  Certainly it is not by human reason.  Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase Sartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing.  Your logic comes to fruition in relativism.    Ah, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in contemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus ('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of language he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary framework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but a threshold.   vonWrights's comment that Witt's \\\"sentences have a content that often lies deep beneath the surface of language.\\\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing ourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with Witt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes in our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it is already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man.  Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.    This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in it conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of understanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \\\"as a man thinketh, so he is.\\\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside, that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals of truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that there is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too are knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the individual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to Christianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the Spirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has the capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not only has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep things of GOd that are absolute and true.    There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced and it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.    \\\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would say unto me.\\\"  Job 23ff  --Rex\",\" Warren Brown, the Washington Post's auto writer was the first journalist to get his hands on the New Yorker.

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the  low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and  would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's  another curve approaching)  3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is  depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern  electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.  this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about  to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as  little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.  also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a 5 speed)?    how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear, low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight. \",\"I am looking for Super 8mm Projector with SOUNDS.

Whether that player is in Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him to be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.  Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian players.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners can do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable here in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US that the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.  Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would make players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in North America?

(ie. the Jets do have a few Russian players in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.)) So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players in North America.   I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the world.

I first heard about it in this newsgroup  several years ago, and I have just got hold of a book, \\\"How to improve your sight - simple daily drills in relaxation\\\", by Margaret D. Corbett,  ('Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953.  It  talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there been any study on whether this method actually works?  If it works, is it by  actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing  the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the  too-long eyeball?  Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the most logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process, i.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there been any recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works by  changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of  eyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the  eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates's  idea, right?)\",\"OK, here's something for all of those people who think cops are always more responsible then the rest of the population.

She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she  believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.   (Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the  food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!

But not all of them did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.  Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include: psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most -- maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of these.  There's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try different things, some of which seem to help.  Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days.

The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre are in 'Milliyet' today.  69 year old Hatin Nine telling:  -''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''  72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:  - ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.   Turks, you must die.''  28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:  - ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of     my eyes.''  Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming? Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?  The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British Journalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.  Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these \\\"lies.\\\" They are saying \\\"exaggeration.\\\" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's 3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...  The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.  Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.  Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''  The age we are living in is termed a human rights age.

Then the masses have the same rights as the individuals, because everything comes down to the individual in one instance or another.  To draw an analogy, Norway is involved in the EEC.  The USA in involved in NATO.  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws.  NATO requires no such changes in USA law.  These laws affect citizens, and hence Norway is saying Europe is more important than, say, Norwegians having motorcycles that make over 100bhp.  In the USA, we'd likely tell the EEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business, in our eyes, in telling us how much horsepower we can safely ride.  While I note that our own state governments often play with game with the federal government, in essence this is a cultural difference between us.    It shouldn't.  Since neither of our countries has managed to remove criminals from society, in America we feel (and remember we have individual states that are larger than your country) that if the police cannot protect us then we must do so ourselves.

The explanation    we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult    members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit    of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,    you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule    is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is    incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.  2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were    outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When    questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault    was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were    thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew    you could!  3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,    hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and    referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm    more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not    related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up    some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's    now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by    the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I    was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI    agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say    uncomplimentary.  4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that    the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the    reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing    this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references    to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around    the \\\"He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\\\"    flag.  Sigh.  5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege    reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought    processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button    because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My    only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to    the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to    an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in    the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the    forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In    that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones    Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:    Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and    other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the    BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have    been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it    was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's    paranoid delusions.     --   #include <std_disclaimer.h>\",\"After reading reports from Germany of success in accelerating a Quadra or Centris simply by changing the clock oscillator, I decided to test the claim.

If I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each (1 for motherboard, 1 for each of the 2 disks), would it work?  Is the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk?

This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know  that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans  are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls  say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times  published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war;  42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent  if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to  sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not  very enthusiastic?  Thank you.              Q   I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going  to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the  answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.              THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is,  it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example,  the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will  obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be  good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will  be used to support the privatization of existing public  enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the  Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have  some influence over the distribution of.                With regard to your second question, let me say that  I would think that there would be people in both countries who  would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government  giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to  that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history  there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That  is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole  history of America, any kind of aid program has always been  unpopular.                What I have tried to tell the American people is, is  this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that  this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion -- trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments  because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in  Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them  working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies  going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it  possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the  economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and  investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce  nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on  our side and on the Russian side.                So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an  investment for the United States.  This is very much in the  interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the  second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next  week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for  the taxpayers and workers of my country.                Russia is a very great nation that needs some  partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share  her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view  this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not  what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful  investment.                Like all investments, there is some risk.  But  there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than  the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier  of the Cold War.              Q   Mr. President, first of all thank you very  much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory  of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American  President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind  of a very measured breakthrough.                I have two questions.  One, in your introductory  remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief  that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you  tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to  what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification  of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how  confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager  to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions  inherited from the Cold War?                PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of  Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with  regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent  states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States  develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing  that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of  the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude  our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that  would provide not only an important economic opportunity for  Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out  on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed  off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and  we agreed to continue to press that.              I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to  reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the  Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the  United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine,  but that, in order to do what we need to do together to  strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States  be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join  the NPT regime is critical.              What was the second question?                THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and  COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the  Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will,  as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other  restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on  relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies  of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of  them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the  leadership of the Congress.              With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be  an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there  are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to  emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there  is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed  to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be  much less.              With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing  more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my  own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement  out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to  begin it in the fairly near future.              Q   Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in  Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely  different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not  political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of  Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the  difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the  difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of  Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the  last part of your speech?              THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to  compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say  what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a  boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the  music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been  thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music  for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists  and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know  as much as I could about your history.                And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then  the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last  presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone  in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr.  Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I  was following events there very closely and hoping for the day  when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a  personal feeling about Russia.                I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like  music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a  musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York  Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony  to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly  than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically  so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it  occurred.                These are things that have always had a big impact  on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever  had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two  countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)

The logic and actual rationale (as opposed to the excuses that get fed to the media) is the same in both cases, only the items or technology in question are different.  I think this is no accident.  It comes from the same philosophy that the government rules/controls the people, not the people controlling the government, that the unconnected citizens are not sophisticated enough to know what is best for them, so the government must tell the people what they need or do not need ... \\\"we know best...\\\".

I would guess that a tiny fraction of 1% of the folks reading your post agree with it. I kind of doubt that even you agree with it.  I'm not going to go through your points one at a time, because,  after all, not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball.  I'm only replying to this because you brought up Pam Postema, the AAA umpire who sued (is suing?) baseball on the grounds of sex discrimination because she wasn't promoted to the majors.   I've never seen her ump a game. I have no first hand experience with her ability as an umpire.  But I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems to me that she is missing the point and if that's how she sees the role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn't promote her either.  The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners safe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is to maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the players from trying to kill each other.   Umpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most of us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of the rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well. Umpires need to command the game; command of the rulebook is secondary.   \",\" box, manual, phonecord    $25 + shipping Dennis \",\"   Wrong.

Generally, these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, for example, we have the following set regarding children:   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to   the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum   [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem   families and received as servants when they are left alone through   the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect   all such children in your province and send them to the places of   deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to   the people.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [1]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the   time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their   lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.      Minister of the Interior,       Talaat\\\" [2]   \\\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.    November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the   orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their   places of exile.        Abdullahad Nuri. [3]    \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been   opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is   done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt   of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or   any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it   purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as   detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received   into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish   special orphanages for them.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat.\\\" [4]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.     Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures   to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with   the caravans.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [5]   \\\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.    At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows   of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is   not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by   Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble   in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned   out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of   deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent   away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [6]  In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \\\"rationalizing\\\" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:   \\\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for   its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks   it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I   shall die for it.\\\" [7]   These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these \\\"death march orders\\\" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.  For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.  If one were to examine the sample \\\"authentic text\\\" provided in the Turkish  Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it  too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the  Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or  Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery.   Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide  architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a  heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.  This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian.     - - - references - - -  [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60  [2] ibid, page 60  [3] ibid, page 60  [4] ibid, page 61  [5] ibid, page 61  [6] ibid, page 62  [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and     London), 1926, page 387  \",\"this is a test   \",\"The Quadra 700 goes thru extensive initalize routines of its hardware, read's PRAM, obtains all info from last session including the volume setting, and then executes the sound procedure for the startup sound, and wait's on the SCSI controller to respond to the boot up code.

Do you find the exegisis convincing or not?)\\\"   MY REPLY...

But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you have produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dug deeper.  I'm glad you have begun in this post.  I will begin Greek studies on these passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well.   DB... \\\"It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as evidence.  Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it often enough:     But are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  Let's see, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other passages, we see that he has also used (b).  On the other hand he has presented no use of:   (d) historical context                or (e) historical content                or (f) other pertinent historical info   or (g) cultural context                  or (h) cultural content                  or (i) other pertinent cultural info     or (j) grammatical construction          or even (k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger don't count]   Thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.\\\"   MY REPLY... Question:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on starting to use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present shallow observations (I don't mean this in a bad way). At this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a total exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re: Judas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use several of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also. It will greatly enhance our study of these passages.   DB... \\\"The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other passage.  Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list is red herring and his only real criteria seems to be:     MY REPLY... The reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that the PASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one another. (1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention; (2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look at your defense of this later.   Also, the \\\"reward of iniquity\\\" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at stating why you believe it is).   At this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.   DB... \\\"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so that both could be considered correct.\\\"   MY REPLY... One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these passages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's explanation of Judas' death...   _____________________________________________________________________   HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \\\"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\\\" =============================================================   This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are constantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error. Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is destroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at all. Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and was crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do they necessarily contradict each other? Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that Judas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be true and supplementary. A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall. Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself. This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at the same time. On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping form the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the case of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a situation of different perspectives of the same event.   _____________________________________________________________________   Your only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit inerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely. Here's what you said in an earlier post...   _____________________________________________________________________ DB [quoting Tony Rose]...   \\\"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so opposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.  But you seem to find Tony Rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David Joslin's.\\\"   _____________________________________________________________________   Here, you discredit Tony's explanation based on what you deem too \\\"heavy\\\" for the passages.  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can say it's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it didn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.   Questions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or are either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an alleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe in this respect.   DB... \\\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:     Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer it because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\\\"   MY REPLY... I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a local hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.   To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is \\\"begging the question\\\", if I may quote you.   [Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian Research Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these terms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]   DB... \\\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\\\"   MY REPLY... Qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention below. Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we have re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's synonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But he lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can discover.   DB... \\\"Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects Christian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.\\\"   MY REPLY... Thank you, Dave.   DB... \\\"Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted the hanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^   MY REPLY... [^^^ above, mine] So it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony's position.  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?   Also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or deceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done with Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including their \\\"interpretation\\\" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.   You also noted they \\\"interpreted\\\" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although that is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember, that's the first criteria we must examine.

[^^^ above, mine] No you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly probable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.   The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New Testament.   In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus), it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \\\"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his father's tomb.\\\"             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \\\"hanged himself\\\" [Gr. Sept., APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \\\"and died\\\".  Here we have no doubt of the result. In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.   Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply means \\\"hang oneself\\\".   DB... \\\"But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable                                                                      ^^^^^^^^^ Christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful.\\\"   MY REPLY... [^^^above, mine] \\\"Reputable\\\"?  You mean ones that have never erred? As far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done, even by me. ^^^^^^^^^   As I said in an earlier post...   _____________________________________________________________________ Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria), I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.   MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \\\"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\\\" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of hanging. All it says is that he \\\"went and hanged himself.\\\" Luke however, in Acts, tells us that \\\"and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\\\" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the other details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle, etc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Matthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable, but not clear ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut. ^^^ _____________________________________________________________________   I also wrote...   _____________________________________________________________________ MY REPLY...   Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed. Let's look at the passage in Matthew:   MAT 27:4 saying, \\\"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.\\\" And they said, \\\"What is that to us? You see to it!\\\"   MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.   MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \\\"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\\\"   MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.   MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   Notice verse 5...\\\"Then he...went and hanged himself.\\\" Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a result of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ What does Acts say? ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.   ACT 1:20 \\\"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'   Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the \\\"two\\\" accounts of Judas' death is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ say Judas \\\"hanged himself\\\", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the hanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no contradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.   .......   MY REPLY... ...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records his death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be the case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ______________________________________________________________________   I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however, highly probable.                            ^^^^^^   DB... \\\"By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as the correct version in both Matt and Acts.  \\\"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\\\" suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly exploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).\\\"   MY REPLY... The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted post gave us some...   _____________________________________________________________________ A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom.

Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the source of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is correct: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from).\\\"   MY REPLY... Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss this with you.   DB... As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically mention \\\"the reward of iniquity\\\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \\\"...concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\\\").  Now I would point out that when the Bible describes an act of \\\"iniquity,\\\" and then immediately discusses \\\"*the* reward of iniquity,\\\" it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\\\"   MY REPLY... Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!   ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, ACT 1:16 \\\"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus; ACT 1:17 \\\"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\\\" ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.) ACT 1:20 \\\"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'   Notice that in verse 16, the word \\\"iniquity\\\" is not used.  Rather, it states that Judas \\\"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\\\". But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \\\"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\\\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?          ^^^^^^ JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it. JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had said to him, \\\"Buy those things we need for the feast,\\\" or that he should give something to the poor.   So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se. Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer, according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of \\\"wages of iniquity\\\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen by Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the \\\"wages of iniquity\\\" are.  What do you think, Dave?   DB... \\\"Now since I have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of asking me what type I think you are, as you did to Mr Joslin).\\\"   MY REPLY...

Frank\",\"I've been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers, notesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night at the Stick.  After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was  very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).  It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.  The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb. McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball. So on & so forth.  I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.

In the five month period between the two seizures, my daughter had eaten a fair amount of Kix and Berry Berry Kix in the mornings and never had a problem.  I checked the labels and the first ingredient is corn.  She has also never had a problem eating corn or corn on the cob but of course, that is usually later in the day with a full stomach so the absorption would not be so high.  I do believe that Frost Flakes have corn in them but I will have to check the Fruit Loops.  But the fact that she has eaten this other corny cereal in the morning makes me wonder.

Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be nice to hear some good news once in a while.  After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a request for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50 in his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded more than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day.  Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a message from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed the money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and assured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He sent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a transfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him to fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times to get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for my signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the deal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world's best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good ones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat you may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my software from him.

Previously, when I first start up my PC I can see all the  CMOS messages (RAM test ...etc) but now I've got to wait  for about 3min before the display shows anything and it starts up with a bright white flash.

Thanks in advance,\",\"All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or Monophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really sola scriptura.  Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by the Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so.  Andy Byler  [You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based on Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus' teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship occuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more time.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are right, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.  Accepting the principle of \\\"sola scriptura\\\" does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite clear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is on where the Bible would have us place the line.  By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters that are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free to determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that the Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or (since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to decide.\",\"My old jacket is about to bite the dust so I'm in the market for a new riding jacket.  I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would like to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.  I'm considering two basic options:  1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs     due to recent price increases, but I'd imagine over $400.     That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact     that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates     the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.  2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new      Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey     unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather     are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose     value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper     than upper Aerostich.  Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other  layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out  lining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows,  shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a  reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would  be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.

For example, incorrect English constructs such as \\\"its raining\\\" or \\\"it's window id\\\" annoy me. However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!).  On a related topic, who is to say that \\\"color\\\" is more or less correct than \\\"colour\\\" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API terms such as \\\"XAllocColor\\\" and \\\"colormap\\\".  In a world that uses the term \\\"Windows\\\" to refer to Microsoft Windows, perhaps the time has come to accept \\\"X Windows\\\" as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say, \\\"the X Window System\\\" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it. Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short, snappy, descriptive title (\\\"X\\\" is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called \\\"Microsoft Windows\\\" or \\\"the Microsoft Window System\\\" or how about just plain \\\"Microsoft\\\"!  To summarise (or should that be \\\"summarize\\\") the point of this message: I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be \\\"windowing system\\\"). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System. \",\" [Stuff deleted]     Will, there has been a lot of discussion going on about this over in s.r.c.b-s. I will make the case here though and try to help you out:  8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9).  Yes, it is by God's grace and our faith that we are saved.  We are not saved by what we do.  However,  15 If ye love me, keep my commandments. (John 14:15).  Keeping Christ's commandments is a \\\"work\\\" per se, and a demonstration of our love for him.  Also,  6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. 7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? 8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: 9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. (Luke 13:6-9).  Again,  16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. (John 15:16).  It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit.  What is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being love, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest in the actions that we carry out.  If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things Christ commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith.  Asking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your pants is more important.  Good works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith, true faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs commands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit, then we shall be uprooted just like the tree.   It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for days about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a building and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you all day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really don't have that faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the test.  Words and talk mean nothing.  I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but this should be sufficient.  Hope it helped.

ST JOHN'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS The St John's Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by problems. On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but off ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the leafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of the seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \\\"home\\\" games in places like Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \\\"home\\\" games will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One demostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus and rocked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium. Despite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs will return to St John's once the strike ends. =================================================== SENATORS SOLD The New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to the Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian NHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear they intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic Provinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL head office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting in May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it  clear the league was more interested in the stability of the  AHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining the 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven.   The Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown New Brunswick and are expected to move there. ================================================== DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON After announcing that they would pull their affiliation out of Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind.   The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they wanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.  Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining 6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks in the New Brunswick city.  The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if the season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold 1400 for this year. ============================================================ SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL The Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of Saint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200 Exhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion frnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble. ========================================================= CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE Despite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore Skipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks, announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates. There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced a limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players including 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited farm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders. ====================================================== AHL GAME OF THE WEEK In early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced by, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian Maritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of the week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there has been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and shown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic Sports Network in Canada (but I'm not sure about that). I am not sure if playoff games will be covered. ===================================================== UTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?

What I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either: \\\"All war   is wrong\\\", or \\\"Some war is justifiable\\\".   To get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the   question. In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New   Zealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of   it, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).   Through this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved   in the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation   hardware as the very best a 'real' flyer could ask for. My favourite   computer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both   past and present.   I became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all   military activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition   to God's commandments to love one another, especially one's enemies.  During the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to   the reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation   technology I so admire - The F117A 'Stealh' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16   strike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy   simulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam's   bio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his   Mig's in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful   game. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.   One only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact   of war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a   pilot is simply a 'target'. Dead civilians are 'collateral damage'. These   euphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose   support are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to   look at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.  Now we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and   the prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in   the former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of   Sarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry 'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,   has caused me to rethink where I stand on 'justifiable' war.  I will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say   - Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut   reactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality   history brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for   my reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I   am working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.  1. The Second World War  - Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.  - Massive civilian casualties on both sides    - Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki  - Probably justifiable.  2. Korean war  - Political expansionism by North Korea, basically    communism vs. capitalism.  - Probably not justifiable.  3. Vietnam  - As above, worsened by US involvement.  4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.  - Genocide by Khmer Rouge.  - Probably justifiable.  5. Iraq (Desert Storm)  - Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply  - Other factors such as genocide.  - Not sure, but probably justifiable  6. A future involvement in Bosnia  - Genocide - so called 'Ethnic Cleansing'  - Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.  - Probably justifiable  7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,   somewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya   or Israel.  - My feelings in this are simple  - Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent  - I love the New Zealand government's stand on banning all nuclear    armed or powered warships from NZ port.  - Never justifiable.  These are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused. I   would appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture. I   *don't* want a - Naaahh, yer wrong - I think answers 8-).  Thanks for your help.  ==========================================================================                                     | Alastair Thomson,                   | Phone +64-3-479-8347 Chief Programmer,                   | Fax   +64-3-479-8529 The Black Albatross Porject,        | University of Otago,                | Department of Computer Science,     | e-mail alastair@farli.otago.ac.nz P.O.

Am I missing something?\",\"    Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions. However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the center.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can always hide a sufficiently small number of a different type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming that there is only one population of GRBs).  The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.  If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy) you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of the Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center (for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.   The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.   There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature. Right now, the theorists have a sort of unofficial moratorium on new models until new observational evidence comes in. \",\"Quoting jgfoot@minerva.cis.yale.edu in article <1r3jgbINN35i@eli.CS.YALE.EDU>: \",\"Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part10 Last-modified: 1993/4/15   FAQ for sci.crypt, part 10: References  This is the tenth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ.

FACT SHEET                    PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT  The President has approved a directive on \\\"Public Encryption Management.\\\"  The directive provides for the following:  Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology.  Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of communications and data by preventing unauthorized access.  Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications.  These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the information age.  Despite its benefits, new communications technology can also frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated encryption can have this effect in the United States.  When exported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence activities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law enforcement and national security interests, while at the same time protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As encryption technology improves, doing so will require new, innovative approaches.  In the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.  To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect and decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted information, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:  INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS  The Attorney General of the United States, or her representative, shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which incorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed key-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from the American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow microcircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications hardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the security of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the government from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.  KEY-ESCROW  The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate entities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits installed in communications equipment.  In each case, the key holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent unauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only to government agencies that have established their authority to acquire the content of those communications that have been encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such communications.  PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES  The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate U.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted with key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems that process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of a final standard within six months of this directive. \",\"No, no, we aren't talking about receptors for the brain's sensory  innervation, but structures such as the thalamus that handle pain for the entire organism.

Your fascist government got away with  the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying  the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away  with the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in  Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem  districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed and hundreds of civilians also perished.     Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included     the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,    Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives,     children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians     joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan     districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of    3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished    to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to    the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and    seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell    into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims    themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels    also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the    large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from    occupying the city.     The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out    the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the    neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They    raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours'    distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.     At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,    Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible    atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in    the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the    neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.     Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the    Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four    villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,    they continued to spread death and destruction among the    Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down    their arms.

I'll try to get better.  Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far, only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.  Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K.  vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.   I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of excuses.    I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.  From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I  see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see the dialog:   Me:  \\\"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\\\"   BK:  \\\"There is no truck.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around at look.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at      the oncoming truck.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around or you will run over.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\\\"  Me:  \\\"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing       to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\\\"       I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.  BK:  \\\"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.       Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\\\"       And by the way, I really have an open mind.\\\"   So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?     I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have. I can now see the truck behind Brian.  My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment, Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture.

If the gift of tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone, no matter what languages they know, there would be no need for the gift of interpretation, and I Corinthians 14 would not have had to have been written.     That's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million Christians world wide.  Sure, there are some who want glory for themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those who do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthian church also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.

A1.  NEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE   * INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage    by a man who infiltrated political groups  By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.  SAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-time art dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In reality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40 years.  His code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office.  For a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White Aryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he obtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people.  And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government to trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills.  These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former Los Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with police and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League.  Officials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improper activity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They have refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz.  Transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents released by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory.  At times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air with laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like \\\"Ironsides\\\" and \\\"Flipper.\\\"  On one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a pro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa, Israel.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties to Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him.  Shortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed him.  The court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIA agent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League.  Gerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its contents included passports, driver's licenses and identification cards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for four American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank birth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies.  Also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a black hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of blindfolded and chained men.  Investigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the ADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one target group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.  Each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant.  The Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil rights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL's fact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists.   However, evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept files on at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the United Farm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center for Investigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, the Asian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP.  The computer files also included information on several members of Congress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey from the Bay Area.  In their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation League has collected information on political activists in the Los Angeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely with three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized in intelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism expert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligence officer.  A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation, and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declined comment.  Bullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as a volunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party.  Bullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by the ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In the mid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the West Coast.  To keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never missed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said.  \\\"I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all anti-democratic movements,\\\" Bullock said.  \\\". . . Officially, I'm only a contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would not be officially connected with me.\\\"  Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists to Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own name but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink.  \\\"I'm one of a kind,\\\" he told police.  In recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly become known, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him.  In the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police.  In part because of this investigation, he became close friends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Francisco police intelligence division.  Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An FBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group:  \\\"Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and would share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to Gerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to Bullock.\\\"  From a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876 individuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose files contained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people.  In 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the South African government.  Bullock tells of meetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100 bills.  Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published by San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African Bishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli -- and submitted it as his own work.  Bullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence.  Bullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African government evenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, \\\"I may be gay but I'm a straight arrow.\\\"  In his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law.  For example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records and criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said Gerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence files on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy.  Bullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation of Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League's San Francisco office.  Bullock seemed proud of his \\\"Operation Eavesdrop,\\\" in which he used a paid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White Aryan Resistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by members of the right-wing group.  \\\"For a short time, it was wonderful,\\\" he told police.  In Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a \\\"fact-finder\\\" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups.  Among other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los Angeles ADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had \\\"anti-Israel leanings\\\" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment.  Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate group.  Gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the probe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation.  Unlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation.  Gurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed by The Times. Bullock's attorney said his client would not comment.\",\" I'm just guessing here, but I'd guess that X11R5 expects the CG3 to have 1152x900 resolution, and the version of the CG3 in the SPARCclassic is  1024x768.  -- \",\"...

In the meantime everyone he mentions has died and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established. Moreover, Pauls account of some of the events in Acts (as recorded in  Galatians) fail to establish the acts accounts.

Those are two separate questions.  Obviously, Israeli authorities do recognize Israeli nationality for some purposes, e.g. passports, consular services, etc...  ID cards have a field of nationality which is a subdivision of the above.  Ostensibly, this field is provided for sevices provided by the religious departments of the gov't, though this is not the general case.   From its onset, Israel's borders have been shaped and reshaped by both war and peace.  As such, the Israeli gov't has always felt that defining its borders is a step that is meaningful only after peace treaties have been conluded with its neighbors.  There is no plan for \\\"ultimate borders\\\" (is this a game like \\\"ultimate frisbee\\\"?) extending into  other countries.   Aside from what Vaanunu provided, no.   If that is true, then by virtue of the question's subject, it is unanswerable.  Anyone who claims its validity. is claiming an oxymoron. That having been said, I deny the above.  You go on to ask quite a number of questions that show an obvious bias.  Questions of the sort \\\"Is it true that you entered your mother's vagina?\\\" which are based upon some kernel of truth, though phrased in a way as to render them repugnant and cast aspersions upon Israel.

I've  transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois. ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.  The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king, who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which  the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million, His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual, seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of slots.  The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions supporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from  70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside). According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and  the Pacific Rim.   RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money. Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began  negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in  Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time. Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way that people operate.  For example \\\"everybody can sell you everything.\\\"   Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.  Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who  went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually, he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the  Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to  allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.  The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied  Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in  Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners :-)  Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is  apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them  specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their  satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They  have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place now.  Tidbits:  *  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big business because big business is just like what they have over there, except that \\\"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\\\"  *  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months.  *  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia, and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.  *  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith.  Italy gets a new government \\\"every two weeks\\\" but we don't worry  because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.  *  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting 25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \\\"equivalent\\\" value in  rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government.  *  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western  satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites, which was rather reassuring.  *  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much  shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the  difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition, shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date hardware. \",\" Is it right???

Being brought up in a Christian household, I often wondered if there was God the Father, where was the mother? Everyone I know who has a father usually as a mother. It just seemed rather unbalanced to me.   Fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not fall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both a masculine and feminine force. It provides a sense of balance I find sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which I think is responsible for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat each other.\",\"*FOR SALE*  Compudyne 386-25SXL Laptop 80 meg HD 4 meg RAM 3.5\\\" FD VGA Monochrome 64 Grey Scale  +Math Coprocessor!

Since they aren't fixed in position on their stainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different position. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of contact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the ball, not the center cylindrical area.  I've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but needs to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our office's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one could still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might help.  I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If you can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl  alcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.  If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see if it is actually causing the axle to spin.   If all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-( It could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be necessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that dirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction.

Let's do it right this time!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:  [1] microgravity/vacuum process research [2] life sciences research (adaptation to space) [3] spacecraft maintenence   The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to centralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet their targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users  took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to  tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization and miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial  users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the  constellation.    Firstly, different functions are broken down into different  constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function: thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits, comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation, providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.  SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments and are also prime candidates for constellization.  [1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now: COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for short-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is inexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities  on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET. We might also expand the research program to take advantage of  interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt  or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a  station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.  [2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity, but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter of LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since astronauts will have little practical use in the space program until costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation, and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars, Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR interface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown, follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface, testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billions are spent on astronauts.  [3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in  Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck solar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs, inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.  By applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we have radically improved the capability of the program while greatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag, we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study life's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety  of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose orbits.  N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration as well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.   Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously  we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and sample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology greenhouses on Mars at low cost.  \",\" While that is currently true from their perspective, it is also worthwhile to note that in such cases the populace often does suffer from attempts to control the guerillas.

As I recall, Amal was primarily nationalistically \\\"Lebanon for the Lebanese\\\" motivated.  I think that the difference between them was also a matter of funding and support.

No peace talks.  N.  No Israel  if we assume that Lebanon and Syria are sincere in their desire for peace, why hasn't the Hizbollah been disarmed?   Bearing in mind the above and that military losses are more palatable than civilian ones, I am sure you can understand why Israel is slow to act in that manner.   I agree that Syria wants Lebanon to be part of its greater Syria. I don't necessarily see that the Syrians would be unhappy to see Israel up to its neck in another Lebanese morass afterwhich Syria could continue on its merry schedule when Israeli public opinion would lead to a second pullout.   <*sigh*>  Why can't some gov'ts negotiate as easily as some people? \",\"Could we plase cease this discussion.

I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, just have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and   muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent  irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep,  wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the  spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot, and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 \\\" apart.)  This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.

Surely you don't wish for the Democrats to destroy our beloved country just so your party can get some trivial political advantage? That's rather a petty way to think. (Not that this pettiness doesn't extend all the way to the U.S. Senate, I've noticed...)  While Bush was president, I kept hoping and praying that he'd wise up. I couldn't stand the man, but I wish he'd done a decent job; if so, we might not be in the mess we are now, and that would be a small price to pay for suffering through another term of Republican control. Similarily, YOU should be hoping and praying that Clinton does a good job. Even if you're certain he won't.\",\"wing the suggestion of Stu Lynne, I have posted the Image File Format executable and source code to alt.sources.\",\"  Take a second look at \\\"non-toxic, non-flammable\\\":    MACE (sold tothe public) is supposedly nontoxic.   Whatthey do not tell you is that if you get mace directly   on the linings of the lungs (such as a direct snort to   the face) above certain quantities, it reacts similarly   to a mustard gas inhalation.     I know:  my father and grandfather were exposed    to poison gas in WWI and WWII; Dad went through    the side effects of any WEAPON, including those    \\\"non-toxic\\\" aerosols.    WHat the label ACTUALLY means is ::     usually, it wont kill you    it may give you permanent CSS asthsma    but that's better than blowing a hole in your     head ...    ALL aerosols are flammable IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OXYGEN   AND HIT IT WITH THE RIGHT IGNITER.  SOme of the most   non-flammable substances known will BOOM or SEARFLAME   if you hit it with the right combo.     Let's take one:  a trash can fire.  Makes black smoke;   already burned right?  Can't go boom, right?  Wrong.    Suck that smoke (made up of paper that has carbonized,   or burned about 35% of the fuel in it) into an air   conditioning return, mix with about 5:1 air, and light   a match.  200 feet of conduit is about the same, when   filled with that smoke mixture, as oh, say 200 pounds TNT     THAT is why the fire codes say NO OPEN CEILING    TILES IN BUILDINGS.  Because 3-5 stories of    a building have blown OUT by \\\"nonflammable _smoke_\\\"   So:   Take a little \\\"nonflammable aerosol\\\"   Mix with gasoline or kerosene fumes     NO electricity, remeber?  A bit of heating    on the WACO plains?  Boil water to drink    since the water was cut off?    liberally mix and allow to settle for 1-4 hours    Fumes vent down into the bus underground, and the Davidians   move the children UPSTAIRS to a saferoom (they had one,   armor plated, remember?) to BREATH, because kids get sick   and die from tear gas.    and along comes a tracer, a spark, what have you:     everyone burns to death.  Try thinking before opening mouth: it may not have happened the way the Gmen say it did.\",\"I once read an article on  Computer technology  which stated that  every new computer technology was actually lower and slower then what it replaced.  Silicon was less  effective then the germanium  products then available.   GaAs  was less capable then Silicon.  Multi-processors were slower then  existent single processors.  What the argument was, though was that these new technologies promised either theoretically future higher performance  or lower cost or higher densities.  I think that the DC-1  may g=fit into this same model.  ELV's can certainly launch more weight  then  a SSRT,  but  an SSRT offers the prospect of  greater cycle times and  lower costs.  This is kind of a speculative posting,  but I thought i'd throw it out as a hjistorical framework  for those interested in the project.\",\"Here are the standings after the April 6 update.

These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and Oberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a spot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence, the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the four sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of the crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional to the position of the spot on the detector's face.  Let's try some ASCII graphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)                  -------------------------> 1              |                       |              |                       |       |\\\\            -----   cathode 1         |       |  \\\\            XXXXX                     ________| +  \\\\            XXXXX|                            |      \\\\        -------     light >XXXXX|                            |        \\\\_____ divider __ output            XXXXX|     |                      |        /      -------            XXXXX|-----| |--                  |      /           |            XXXXX|   + |    |         ________| -  /           1 + 2            XXXXX|         --- gnd    |       |  /            XXXXX|         \\\\ /        |       |/            XXXXX| anode              |            XXXXX                     |            ----- cathode 2           |              |                       |              |                       |              --------------------------> 2  If the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position of the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina- tion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).  When this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light, then the way of \\\"tuning\\\" to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal, light the LED for an equal time and sample that signal separately.  The difference between the two is the position of the LED.  Hamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2-D lateral photoeffect detectors, and they also sell the required signal processing electronics.  The ready-made systems by SELSPOT and others are NOT cheap ...   Lindholm, L.E., and K.E.

If you are  considering buying one or the other, definitely go for the DX with a nice  size external cache!  The performance is far greater.  The DX2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50MHz, while the DX  has a potentially much larger cache to work at 50MHz with.  Neither  systems could actually run a program out of main memory, since DRAM is  still too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns = 16.66MHz < 50MHz ).  -rdd  ---  . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were performed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter antenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis is in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.  3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network) advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone 70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees to 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.  5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance measurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC measurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and currently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 184 hours   TRAJECTORY       As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:   Distance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU)  Distance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU)  Heliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour  Distance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km  Round Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds   SPECIAL TOPIC\",\"Can someone please remind me who said a well known quotation?

If it has two positions, its an AR-15, if    it has three, its an M-16.  There are numerous internal differences    as well, but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see    them, they are not valid in this discussion.  So, in conclusion,    there is very little external differences to distinguish an AR-15    from an M-16 except at close (very close) range.

Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence \\\"ESC [ 1 B 7\\\"  would indicate that the \\\"HOME\\\" key was pressed, with the shift key down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such as \\\"shift-Return\\\".  If anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code in the source file \\\"x11term.c\\\".  Maybe if someone at OSF is  interested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about  emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods  somewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.  Notes:    * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create    its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which     includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.   * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2    [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].

He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has  36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain throughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and Mark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than MVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.  Biggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season as a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+ points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming from the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew Cassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23 and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put up about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing,  although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the right side.  Biggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77 point season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started the season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate, since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it). Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded the powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his way out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left to run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the  Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar after signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of competence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better hockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got to make a number of starts in a row.\",\"    >>>Does the greatly increased rates of incarceration amongst     >>>blacks show that they are dysfunctional or that the majority     >>>of them support criminal activity?     >>>     >Isn't this a matter of demographics?

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration rate for violent crimes.  So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism present.  There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.  Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt blacks.  In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).  Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.  Blacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences, except in the South, where they receive around 20% less on paper!!    --  There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of environmental disaster.

Used printers are fine, non-apple printers are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:  Required features:  - PostScript  - 300 dpi  - emough memory to download fonts  - The cheaper, the better.  I'd prefer under $1000.

I'm a laser bigot and the first to admit it. :)   I'll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I'm writing.  The page will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and maybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn't need to be spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.   Printers I've been looking at:   - used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that   only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?  - Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).

I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz. The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.    The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used at these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design of this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).    While using this would have let me reduce the \\\"external\\\" IF count on receive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I didn't bother with it.    The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2 MHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios actually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and speed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data stream is another matter entirely.    Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a \\\"beacon\\\" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO also shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even though the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes of the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of a second.    I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the proceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running low on resources of time, money and energy.    If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW ID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma Mtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally polarized.    I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and you might want to carefully consider your \\\"target\\\".  If you can't arrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think you'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by multipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS. For more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread spectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems. I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.  73 Glenn Elmore n6gn\",\"  I am fairly sure that she could obtain citizenship by making an application for it.

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed    to Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their    plan !     (Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity    since it was coined by Bnai Brith)     What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media,    is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic    Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in    Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.     However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their    homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political    thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the    Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.     As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.     Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true    super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the    Jews used to establish their state : Religion.      Ahmed.  Forget the syntax, Ahmed, and focus on the semnatics. The fact is that the PLO does not recognize Israel's right to exist. This is perfectly obvious from the PLO covenant (Cairo, 1968). The covenant calls for the destruction of the \\\"Zionist entity\\\". As far as I know the Israel-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies the purpose for the existence of the PLO. If you would like, I can post the relevant caluses.  Now the Hamas ideal is far more radical, it seems. I know it has been posted here several times, and while I do not have a copy of it, I am sure that someone does and he (or she, of course) would be more than happy to repost it.  Regardless of phrasing, groups like Hamas, and the Hezbollah, and even the newly moderate and politically-correct PLO, have at the very heart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel.  It just seems to me that Mr. Davidsson's suggestion that Jews support people envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealing one to many Jews.\",\"The Centaur is controlled technology..

I've been doing it my self over 200,000 miles, on my current toyota truck I've got over 150k. I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission. My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use?  On some old pieces of junk I drove, the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless. To date I've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy. Some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker & easier they where to shift.  My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window, I lightly press the accelerator & try agian. I've found that clutchless shifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000). I also skip gears some times using 1-3-5 ,1-2-4-5. \",\"  A brain abscess is an infection deep in the brain substance.

For example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book \\\"Sinus Survival\\\", always gives, before any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his new patients IF they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times in the last two years.  He's kept a record of the results, and for over  2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief of allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his program.  In my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorly  written book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which I never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage of Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm also *greatly* improved in other areas as well.  Of course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to molds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a natural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various sorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus since that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000 question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was from over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there's no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.  BTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll find a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.  In summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', I cannot guarantee their safety.

What do you mean fair?  God is just, giving to everyone what they deserve. As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf Romans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole of the human race except Mary, have sinned.  Which is why Jesus said, \\\"Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless he is born of water and Spirit\\\" which is the true meaning of born again (John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.

I would describe myself as an agnostic, in so far as I'm sure there is no single, universal supreme being, but if there is one and it is just, we will surely be judged on whether we lived good lives, striving to achieve that goodness that is within the power of each of us.  Now, the complication is that one of my best friends has become very fundamentalist.  That would normally be a non-issue with me, but he feels it is his responsibility to proselytize me (which I guess it is, according to his faith).  This is a great strain to our friendship.  I would have no problem if the subject didn't come up, but when it does, the discussion quickly begins to offend both of us: he is offended because I call into question his bedrock beliefs; I am offended by what I feel is a subscription to superstition, rationalized by such circular arguments as 'the Bible is God's word because He tells us in the Bible that it is so.'  So my question is, how can I convince him that this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preserve what is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a great friendship?

Ha Ha. :|  \",\"[insert deletion of unnecessary quote]   First of all, God does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing people.  He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19).  However, if he enjoyed punishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus to \\\"seek and save that which was lost\\\" (Luke 19:10)?  You asked for it.  2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished. Matthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in God's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity. 2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the disciples \\\"will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord\\\". 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth being condemned. Revelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes and those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in the \\\"fiery lake of burning sulfur\\\". Revelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast \\\"will be tormented with burning sulfur\\\" and there being \\\"no rest day or night\\\" for them because of it. Psalm 9:17:  \\\"The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that forget God.\\\"  I think those should be sufficient to prove the point.   Joe Fisher  [In the following I'm mostly playing \\\"devil's advocate\\\".  I'm not advocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that it's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible to see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often uses the term \\\"second death\\\".  The most obvious understanding of that would seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks both of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms that can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince you of one view or the other, but to help people understand that there's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to understand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire, whatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35 implies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably they just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to  understand this passage in a non-literal way.)  2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them in hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.  Matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is eternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever. Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been prepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the eternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet will be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being thrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \\\"the second death\\\". This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as the devil, and humans?  2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \\\"everlasting destruction\\\"? This is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be understood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in eternity.  2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction. Revelation 21:6-8: see comment above Revelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there, it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says that the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that  there is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people are tormented forever.

This three part message consists of E[M; K], K encrypted with some other key, and the chip serial number.  This three part message is then encrypted by still another key.

The speech waveform is sampled and digitized and then some number of samples are grouped into a 64 bit block. This block is then encrypted and transmitted over a non-secure communications link.

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master.    In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives  when performing diagnostics.    There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way  interface connector. They have the following functions and are described  in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper  described nearest the 40 way interface connector.  LK2: LED       When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the      interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An      external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with      the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will      be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130      Ohms ot 220 Ohms.  LK1: Dual Drives      This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single      bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,      indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.  LK4: Master      When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If      there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be      jumpered in this way.  LK5: IOChRdy      When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is       fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher      data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per      second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally       fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per      second.     There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s) may be jumpered:       Master, single drive with LED on interface  LK2 & LK4 fitted.      Master, single drive without LED on interface LK4 only fitted.      Master, dual drive without LED on interface LK4 & LK1 fitted.      Slave, dual drive without LED on interface  No jumpers fitted.      Master, dual drive with LED on interface  LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.      Slave, dual drive with LED on interface  LK2 only fitted.     The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.     The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way  connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the  drive for this LED driver.

I will surely answer!\",\"or there   Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.  The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was because of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by scanning this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines).  When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \\\"I want to play a mono sound\\\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted the documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound.  Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from the IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.  Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware, and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase works. On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra 700/900/950 at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel only. Both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification, but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.  If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their games will only come out the left on some games.  The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related. It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what machine you have.  Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list: and also Hellcats, Super Tetris Oxyd (and many more, these are just what I've tested)  Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.   Other games you list: and also PGA Tour Golf Civilization (and more, these are again only from personal experience)  Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.  The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT! Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to do, but I'm going say it anyway. Stop cheating on sound! Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period is about to end. The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will work even better soon, so use it.  In conclusion: To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug. To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all hardware.   Have fun.  Disclaimer number 1: I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed. So don't write me with sound questions.  Disclaimer number 2: If it says up above that I wrote anything like \\\"the grace period is about to end\\\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.  Disclaimer number 3: I don't speak for Apple, just me.\",\"  I originally wrote to the person who asked this question personally, but decided to post the information I had on the topic.   I spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently,  by coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that  while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the  Church as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church  recoginizes itself as a community of believers, members of the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable to each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island, there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without the priest being present, but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area.     I remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus, married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the community.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with one another--the community should be able to rely on that  couple to be as one.   While couples may marry without witnesses, they  may NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An  anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage at all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half-hour later!!   I tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage, but I would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they intended to be married, assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a commitment, I believe, in God's eyes.   But I'm digressing....     God be with you,\",\"    We're looking at a series of chips by WSI, the PSD3xx series. They have _mega_ address decoding logic on them, various ROM sizes (upto 1Mbit), various RAM sizes (upto 16 K), and 19 I/O ports which can be chip select lines, I/O or the buffered address lines.  Cute chip, 44 pin PLCC package.  Second sourcing may be a problem though :-( \",\"The subject says what I would like to do, here are the details:  I have a 512ke with the MacRescue upgrade board that makes it the equivalent of a Plus (System 7 and MacEnvy both identify it as such).  The MacRescue board clips onto the 68000 on the MB.  It also has a 68000 itself.  Periodically I have to remove the clip (not an entirely easy thing to do) and clean the \\\"legs\\\" of the 68000. Larry Pina's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with snap on upgrades:  the 68000's \\\"legs\\\" will oxidize, causing  unusual system errors.  Well, that's me.  So, I would like to do something permanent, and I think it would be fairly easy to put a socket in where the 68000 currently is, and modify the MacRescue board to plug in.  What I'm not 100% sure of is whether it will work.  It seems to me that the two 68000s aren't acting independently; so removing one shouldn't have any effect on the performance of my Mac.  I'm about 97% sure.  Will someone provide the extra 3%?\",\"It would be nice to think that individuals can somehow 'beat the system' and like a space explorer, boldly go where no man has gone before and return with a prize cure. Unfortunately, too often the prize is limited and the efficacy of the 'cure' questionable when applied to all sufferers.  This applies to both medical researchers and non-medical individuals. Just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use does not make the next cure-all. What about the dozens of individuals who have courageously participated in clinical trials? Did they have any guarentee of cures? Are they any less because they didn't trumpet their story all over the world?  As a parting note, wasn't there some studies done on Gingko seeds for Meniere's? (To the original poster : what about trying for a trial of that? It's probably not a final answer but it certainly may alleviate some of the discomfort. And you'd be helping answer the question for future sufferers.)\",\"I need help binding some value to the HOME and END keys on my keyboard.

Thanks.  \",\"Kevin Mitchell's sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated  pitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over  New York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started  with a solid single to right, moved to second on \\\"Bob\\\" Kelly's infield sneaker down the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a  rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.  Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only  given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double by Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after Joe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who  argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by \\\"drawing the line\\\" (really, he should know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting tossed.  The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must  have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's single, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell and turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson failed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:  Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly: Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended. (Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)  The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's ground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back singles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long fly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was hung out to dry killing the Reds rally.  Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game in late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended up walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a  week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went to Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings work, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit surprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.  The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory today.  The Mets are 6-5.

I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target, then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to harm.  But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away, heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this moment is hazy.  I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not. So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!  Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.  What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?  I eagerly await comment.

Allan, I know the circumstances of several of your falls. On the ride when you fell while I was next behind you, you made an error of judgement by riding too fast when you knew the road was damp, and you reacted badly when you were surprised by an oncoming car.  That crash was due to factors that were subject to your control.

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:     I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the    net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in    schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside    the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?    Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as    provided for in canon law.  Here's some of the theology involved for the interested.  There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's \\\"schism\\\"; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:  - true obedience - false obedience - disobedience - schism  Take the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes:  1) a command 2) the response made to the command  As far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be ILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god Dagon when every other full moon comes around.  As far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do what is commanded, or to COMPLY.  Making a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:  command         response            name ----------------------------------------------------- LEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience ILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience LEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience ILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience  So now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.  Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of the commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to consider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are \\\"obedient\\\" or \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad.  In my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god Dagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!  As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.  And there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been commanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of course disagreed.  So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the traditional teaching of the Church is.  The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of American Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You will never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press in this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I get -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X.)  Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some soundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually some Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand, there is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the Popes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, if the situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very least, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this badly.  Schism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?  Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate command).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, so it doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are schismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with the Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.  So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.  You must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any decent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find: the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command.  Here's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:      ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this     character it must include besides the trangression of the commands     of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.     (from the CE article \\\"Schism\\\")  Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear no: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every day.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.  What all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position is a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and schism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone who finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)  Now, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the Holy Father's motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", you can find out.  It's the definitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically Papal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter that the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Pope himself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.  In this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:  1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre constituted a schismatic act.  2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of Tradtion.  Both are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.  As far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting article in a translation of the Italian magazine \\\"Si Si No No\\\".  It all gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they would truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is this: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power of Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the Pope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite well, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.  The \\\"Si Si No No\\\" article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel, post-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea, episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article to a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.  The Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me. There's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic theology.  So why does the Pope think this?  As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's the passage in question:      The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete     and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does     not take sufficiently into the account the living character of     Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,          comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the         help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into         the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes         about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and         study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.         It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which         they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who         have received, along with their right of succession in the         espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.      But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which     opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the     Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to     remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond     with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ     himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.      (Papal motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", 2 July 1988)  It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following:  - Vatican Council II has happened. - I am the Pope.  The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that Archbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them. This is weak, to say the least!  It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed Archbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II's stand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius IX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to ignore what all these Popes said on the subject?  I don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the SSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.  --------------------------------------------------------------  [Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey \\\"justified disobedience\\\" or even \\\"obeying God rather than man\\\". Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in Wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.  Similarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope says that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it exists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break, that there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will shortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?  It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in the process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his powers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is all in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally it has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope. While they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated. This would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command that you say defines schism.\",\"  First of all, I resent your assumption that you know why I am threatened by science, or even that I am threatened at all, although I admit the latter.  The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence-- God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree, Science.   My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations, for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone. Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have  children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that is made possible.   People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death, and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world.   This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely  prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary  alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,   go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us?   I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not, but I will say this:  Before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body they have been given, they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to  believe their search is displeasing to God.\",\"   The newspaper itself is almost certainly copyrighted in its entirety.

This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason to believe it still goes on.  Read this:  From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992  PUBLICATION BAN          The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many         years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were         sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of         their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever         being made public.  By Baruch Me'iri  All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: \\\"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published\\\".  The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.  In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy.  In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about \\\"the third man\\\" being in prison.  But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries.  But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.  The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:  \\\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner\\\", asserts MK Zucker.  On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \\\"There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public.  \\\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\\\"  Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  \\\"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret\\\", wrote Zucker.  The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, \\\"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter\\\".  \\\"The Union is aware\\\", says Shiffman, \\\"of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.  \\\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy...\\\"  Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible.  \\\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it.\\\"  -- Do you find this situation acceptable?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment.\\\"  -- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the discretion of the court?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse.\\\"  -- And what if there really is a security issue?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.  Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public.\\\"  Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \\\"A healthy situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security\\\".  A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir.  \\\"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.  \\\"Nevertheless\\\", adds Shtendal, \\\"the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\\"  Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \\\"As a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances.\\\"\",\"I'm looking for a PC that is small and doesn't break apart if you drop it on the groud.

Apple does not offer an upgrade from the non-FPU system to become an FPU system.  And, it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-FPU system (a 68LC040) can be replaced with a 68RC040 supplied by another vendor. Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris 610, which ONLY comes with a non-FPU 68LC040 processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU - the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot swap one for another (again, according to Apple's memo).

I was wondering: although a DX-50 is faster because of the path to it's external cache, shouldn't the choice be the DX2-50 as that one can be made to work properly with a local-bus? I mean, cache speed is one thing, but all your speed will be blocked during video I/O, so just get that faster...  I'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times  as fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)!\",\"  ]In article <C4vr7z.EB0@usenet.ucs.indiana.edu>,      >>Is it a hidden option?

What about people who disagree with the chosen moral system?      /(hudson) /But if morality is considered to /be relative, and this rule isn't based on anything, but is just an arbitrary /rule, people might abandon it.  Fine.  I can agree with most of what you typed here.  However, just because morality gets based on something nonrelative does NOT mean that we have to pick your xtianity as its base.\",\"Excuse me, but if you really new what the show was about, you'd know that he doesn't just say vagina and penis and that is how he get's his ratings.

I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in \\\"contraceptive technology\\\" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.    Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't we teach \\\"safe drug use\\\" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it because we know that a class in \\\"how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs\\\" would increase drug use?  Why isn't \\\"drug abstinence education\\\" barred from schools because it teaches \\\"religion\\\"?  Aren't we abandoning those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe use?  \",\"   Well...I need the old 8\\\" disks ...

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.   The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password   and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full   descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli   [BER91].    decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.    There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,   Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will   decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox   files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you   think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a   call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files   that have a 10 char or less pw key.''  * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?    A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the   plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.   If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the   following:     1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.   (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of   the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.    If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something   over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different   key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes   of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which   indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.    2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This   removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since   English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of   text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing   plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact   one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)    If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a   standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis   texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in   the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.   See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].  * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]    Here's one popular method, using the des command:      cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail    Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called   PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through   1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.   There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this   writing.    There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting   mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own   newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ   as well.    PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm   without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)   in the USA.    RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which   is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside   the USA.    Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of   the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the   message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there   have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and   algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as   we know).  * Is the UNIX crypt command secure?    No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt   breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks   on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].  * How do I use compression with encryption?    A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by   some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).    Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact   distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's   impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse   characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up   more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy   has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some   redundancy in your compressed output.    Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they   have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that   actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of   UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''   that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.      This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a   bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means   removes the need for strong encryption.    Compression after encryption is silly.  * Is there an unbreakable cipher?    Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the   one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as   plaintext.    Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be   useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by   likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is   expected to remain valid.  * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?    Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom   number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be   cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to   predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of   the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of   0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.    A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function   of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently   random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by   the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps   generated by a hardware random number source).    Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,   generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of   entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,   cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo    gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in   it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,   for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random   string.    When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is   important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that   because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \\\"random\\\".  For   example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be   unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a   clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.  * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?    See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount   of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in   the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number   of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this   can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to   back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.    Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have   multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security   from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.    Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic   measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives   probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext   for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible   plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys   are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally   deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine   the likelihood of events of interest.    Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than   D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not   enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of   possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,   which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to   8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but   the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work   required to find the key after approximately D characters have been   intercepted.    In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used   in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key   size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if   it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few   practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all   manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack   some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic   considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a   recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.   Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and   information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most   promising directions.    Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information   statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal   1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the   possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].  * What is key management and why is it important?    One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in   full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,   and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of   course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling   Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)   Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can   eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in   modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are   transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but   also enough key material to cover the traffic.    Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and   handling of keys.    A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology   is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use   employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key   Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that   certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control   personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and   to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the   reporting of lost CIKs.    This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management   problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,   many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''  * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?    Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from   relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a   linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random   number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds   and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a   high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically   this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for   cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more   complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---   but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable   structure at all.    See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].  * What is the correct frequency list for English letters?    There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than   the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:   namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of   English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,   but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.    The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do   you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a   fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It   has changed over time; it is different between different authors.   Any particular message will have different statistics from those of   the language as a whole.    The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have   exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all   reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.   In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other   buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood   estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a   text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with   reasonably robust answers.    So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will   be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.  * What is the Enigma?    ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of   information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by   the British during WWII.''    See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].  * How do I shuffle cards?    Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of   values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output   permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you   need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly   distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that   function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH   is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two   addresses given)    for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;    modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since   ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the   error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s   modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less   than y, go back and get another ranno() value.   * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?    Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with   possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted   separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps   even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.    As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard   PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the   keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be   encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in   part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one   of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.    If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must   be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in   the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.   The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the   illegal copy.   * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?

Just about the only circumstances  in which I could think that they would be interested in their political  views would be to recruit them as spooks. They can be guaranteed to give the government line when it counts. In US history it has been the  socialists such as myself who have been persecuted.    Now before people start asserting that there is no mechanism by which the administration can get their new chip adopted without legal force lets try thinking.  In the first place the clipper chip must have existed for several years as a defense project. Therefore this is not a party matter at all. George Bush was in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls, he was chief spook  remember.  Secondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure. They simply \\\"ask\\\" their chums who they give huge defense contracts to (motorola etc) to be \\\"nice\\\" boys. After all Bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly since the chips won't be avaliable to foreign firms.  Thirdly the people who consider the Democrats to be socialist are not the same as the ones who consider socialists to be communist. People might know this if the US education system did not suffer from the Mcarthyite and  Dewy version of political correctness - the sort with tribunals and show  trials. Ever seen Ed Meese pissed? I have, it was when he said that socialism and communism were the same thing and brought the house down with laughter. It took several minutes before we realised that he was serious.

Sometimes.....  Depends on WHY it misfired....   I can't imagine doing much combat type shooting single action.....   Assuming the cylinder WILL rotate....   Never hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you've got one of those 'new fangled' hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties, it's unnecessarily redundant.  I'd rather have the extra round.   Quite true.  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around than magazines though.   True, but this is a training function.   Cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions are the only carry modes that make sense...  The 80 series Colt's for example are quite safe to carry this way.   Agreed.  Now that I've shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It is true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  On the other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the years.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high primers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem. An auto?  Jack the slide and continue.  I've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from turning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen with a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.  Most revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sorts of close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto take a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely to malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight. The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall into that category.  Vincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing view of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's \\\"The Semi Auto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\\\"  In general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi auto effectively as a self defense arm.  Most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department isn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their own.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several times that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother.  For myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pick what fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that day and so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!  That said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of buying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a Ruger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok too!)  If this post had gone the other way, I'd be arguing for revolvers. :-)\",\"# #The argument that \\\"slavery was a dying institution\\\" was often made by #            ^^^ #            (IS) #  # #historians, mainly Southerners, who sought to divert attention from the  # #institution as the central issue of the Civil War.

Compare the Northern #  agricultural system with the Southern and you will see a major difference  #  in the capital to labor intensity.  Capital and labor are one and the same in a slave economy.  Except that capital doesn't reproduce quite as readily as slaves did.

This assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments would not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the North.  Since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else to destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, I do not doubt that they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive threat.  Thomas Sowell's _Market and Minorities_ argues that the maintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and local governments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outside capital investment in the Southern states.  #  Craig A.

First of all, with the Islanders  back-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that  the Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period, come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable how many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty  wide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played  a golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL  debut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this  guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a  Mahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot  correctly.  Has anyone else noticed this?   Also, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick Vukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey talent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the puck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties.  Richard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he's a defenseman.  He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus.  This guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \\\"enforcers\\\"?  Not only do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are really trying to play the game.  I'll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a  good fight once in a while, but only when it's \\\"called for\\\".  You know, when a guy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \\\"hockey ethics\\\" might cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are losing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already.  I'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the referee doesn't call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy, not physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost.  If you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place.  Just My Honest Opinion,\",\" Then not murdering would have no moral significance, since there would be nothing voluntary about it.   You are starting to get the point.   Mimicry is not necessarily the  same as the action being imitated.   A Parrot saying \\\"Pretty Polly\\\"  isn't necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of Polly.   See above.   They do.   I and other posters have given you many examples of exactly this, but you seem to have a very short memory.   I'm saying:   \\\"There must be the possibility that the organism - it's not   just people we are talking about - can consider alternatives.\\\"  It's right there in the posting you are replying to.\",\"Darryl Strawberry's moon shots were fun!  He can hit those high and far home runs that if he actually ran them out he'd be rounding second base by the time they landed.  We used to say that he should have to file a flight plan at LaGuardia for some of them.  Then _Bull_Durham_ came out and that was changed.  :-)  On homers he pulled that didn't go high, they were microwave home runs. Microwave, as in they got outta there in a hurry!  In a game in 1988, he came off the bench with the flu and on the second pitch send a rocket down the right field line that didn't even allow Bob Murphy the \\\"luxury\\\" of a home run call.  The story went he stayed in the clubhouse, the with the Mets down by two and two on Davey Johnson sent for him to pinch hit. He came out of the clubhouse saying \\\"one swing and we go home.\\\"  He hit the homer, ran the bases, then went straight for the clubhouse to shower and go home.  Those were the days....\",\" Version 2.03 drivers are current.\",\" The answer to both questions is yes.  All Scripture is true, being inspired by God.  The evidence for this claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group.  Similarly, all truth is absolute.  Indeed, a non-absolute truth is a  contradiction in terms.  When is something absolute?  When it is always true.  Obviously, if a \\\"truth\\\" is not always \\\"true\\\" then we have a contradiction in terms.    Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a statement is terribly self-contradictory.  Let me put it to you this way.  If there are no absolutes, shouldn't we conclude that the statement, \\\"There are no absolutes\\\" is not absolutely true?  Obviously, we have a contradiction here.  This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming that there are indeed absolutes in the universe.   So?  People sometimes disagree about what is true.  This does not negate the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  Moreover, evangelical Christianity, at least, still professes to believe in certain truths.  Man is sinful, man needs salvation, and Jesus is the propitiation for mankind's sins, to name a few.  Any group that does not profess to believe these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical.  \",\" Fine.  Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable with the use of state sponsored coercion.  The notion that coercion can be virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious  consideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.    For example, does \\\"non-initiated force\\\" (coercion) include tax collection? Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned by Adam Smith?  Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the state, how is the state to deal with it?  Exclusively through after the fact arbitration/legal compulsion?     Well, I must admit that the picture of libertarians as Amway participants is somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a  complex, conflictual, industrial society.  I'd venture to point out,  however, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group  of \\\"seminar participants\\\" to \\\"embrace\\\" their philosophy, their  propaganda skills need to be honed.    Frankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a  society in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper government policy.  Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalities can be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  And as Mr. Marx said, the state will just wither away.    On the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating  virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the  current society will help us to live happier lives? Or is it like socialism; just some short-term pain that we'll have to bear until  everyone has had the benefit of \\\"re-education\\\" through regular  \\\"seminar\\\" training?  jsh \",\"What exactly are knots, those sore, tight spots in your muscles?

Also, I seem to think that the s/w for the QCR-Z (at the time) did strange (and very undesirable) things if ANY part of the pic was outside the screen area on Corel.  I once spent an afternoon painfully discovering that ONE pixel had somehow strayed off-screen, causing my whole slide to be blank!!!  The QCR-Z also couldn't handle grad-fill over grad-fill - so if you use a graduated colour background, if you then grad-fill an object on top of this, the fill appears on the final slide as a circle (I think) and TOTALLY IGNORES the shape of the object being filled!!!

TORTURE.  /* Written  4:41 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */ /* ---------- \\\"From Israeli press. TORTURE.\\\" ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.  Newspaper: Ma'ariv Date: 18. December 1992 Author: Avi Raz  Subject: Torture  Title of article: Moderate physical pressure  Several times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation room in Tulkarm prison, during which he says he was humiliated, beaten and tortured, Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator, a Shabak agent 'Captain Louis', chatting on the phone with his wife. \\\"At those moments\\\", Omar said, \\\"I felt that he was like a humanbeing, but right after he finished talking, he would be beat me and say, 'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed yourself' and I understood that he was not really a human being\\\".  In late October 1992, after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm prison, Omar Jaber was released without charges. \\\"Among the Jews, as among the Arabs, there are good people and bad people\\\", he said after his release, \\\"but there, in Tulkarm, in the interrogations rooms, you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that he is a human being\\\". Although he left the detention installation in Tulkarm bruised and humiliated (\\\"I sat at home for ten days. My hands shook from nerves\\\"), one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: He got out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returned to normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns.  In contrast, Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi, for example, was released seven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the Shabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. He doesn't speak or react. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early August and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, left it one day later - dead. \\\"We have recently received an especially large number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at the Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators\\\", noted Dr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel and Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights. (...)  The right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan Saber Makhlouf, a 20 year old student. In fact, he was extremely fearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated in Tulkarm prison, in case the publication in the paper would return him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment.  (...follow description of tortures....)  Omar, a tall bearded man, was silent. \\\"I do not want to talk about it\\\", he finally said, quietly. Some time later, embarrased and ashamed, he spoke: \\\"Sometimes he beats you and beats you until you'll kiss his hand, and not only his hand. Even the hands of another interrogator, and another, whom he calls into the room, later if I want, you will kiss my ass.\\\"  These things take place in an Israeli army detention installation, located within the military government compound in Tulkarm (West Bank). But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In early March the IDF allowed representatives of B'Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories, to visit Tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogation wing. \\\"The interrogation wing is Shabak property, being solely under Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed by it\\\", said Lieutnant Sharon Sho'an, the commander of the installation, according to the internal report written by B'tselem member, Yuval Ginbar, following the visit. Major David Pe'er, governing commander of the prison system in the Central Command, was quoted in the report:  \\\"There is an ethical problem here - no one can enter the interrogation wing\\\".\",\"Are any readers of s.r.c. going to the Love Europe congress in Germany this July?\",\"FYI...I just posted this on alt.psychoactives as a response to what the group is for......

Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically     reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.   For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical     Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered from  chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day ate 8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second  6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the     women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection  were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.      The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.   It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The    researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some     brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus          thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used   in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a          protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to   try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists      acidophilus in its contents.                                             --- end ---                                                ===================================  InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92   THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED   ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS   MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

I am interesting in cartography and would find these gifs useful.  tia, \",\"  But whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the neutron and becoming radioactive itself. Mostly, that means water turning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would  also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.  As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in a dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private ownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe condition. If any random private citizen could not properly keep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation is clearly appropriate.    I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community. If you look at the American  revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves from, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They didn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for  example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same old regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and destroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate. But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited for that.  There is also the question of personal and collective arms: The Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers other arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example) a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively) should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a  disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower. The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely democratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only 50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would be proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular will were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the form of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's firepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not of the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite different from the general public (at the very least, they would be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and character of the militia requires that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal weapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.\",\"Can anyone tell me if a bloodcount of 40 when diagnosed as hypoglycemic is dangerous, i.e. indicates a possible pancreatic problem?

It has Bosch *mechanical* fuel injection that I am sure needs adjustment.  Any opinions are welcome on what to look for or who to call.  Email or post (to rec.autos), I will summarize if people want.\",\"  [...stiff deleted...]   [...stiff deleted...]  Speed is a quantifiable measure resulting from a set of methods that will result in the same value measured no matter the reference.  A  bullet with zero velocity sitting on a table on a train moving 60mph will be moving at a speed of          (a) 0mph to someone on the train.         (b) 60mph to someone stationary next to the train.  The reference frame makes the speed relative.  But what's interesting here is that every person on the train will see a stationary bullet. Every person off, a bullet moving 60mph.    I know of no train where all the people on it, every time it is filled, will see a moral problem in exactly the same way. \",\"Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith                     LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE  [AUTHOR'S NOTE:  \\\"Adrian\\\" -- name changed to protect the guilty --  and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with  the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]  Dear Adrian:    I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to  your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and  generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist  mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back  with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present  now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the  future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.    There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger  of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan.  10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition,  shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic  rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll  limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent  with your note.    First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Second, publication of some latter-day \\\"scientific study\\\" doesn't  alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my  interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.    Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Fourth, as often happens with these things, the \\\"study\\\" doesn't  support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions  anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older  body of lies, omissions, and distortions.    Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on  countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this  present \\\"study\\\" dubious, to say the least.    Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat  (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you  should be better aware than most people how \\\"progress\\\" -- in  designing \\\"studies\\\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our  ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree  on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30  years to create \\\"studies\\\" \\\"proving\\\" that pornography causes crime.   More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s  clearly indicate the contrary.    Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Tenth, another reason to doubt all such \\\"studies\\\" is that human  behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The  attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the  resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.    Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Twelfth, the \\\"study\\\" is also worthless because it incorporates  figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but  basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social  benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a  criminal offense.    Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials  quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are  many), are correct in this instance:  the \\\"study\\\" is meaningless  because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    And because of that, Adrian, even if the \\\"study\\\" were valid, it  wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that  anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however,  whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's  permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists  themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed  people to go out and buy their first gun \\\"while they still can\\\".   Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \\\"shooting fraternity\\\"  viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate,  ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in  the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys,  and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we  probably manufacture at least that many every year.  The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly  aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what  their real motives are.    Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way,  it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic;  the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the  self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing  this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a  quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \\\"half life\\\"  of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna  be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.  As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law  provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I  will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is  that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands  -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can  only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given  both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics  and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.    So what's the point?    L.

As I can find no Scripture (have I missed it ?) that details when you are married, I have to make some assumptions based on the PRINCIPLES of Scripture.    It seems to me that it takes 3 parties to make a marriage: husband-to-be, wife-to-be, and God.  If you promise before each other and God that you will convenant together to be married, then...you are (IMO).  So why do we have the ceremonial part ?  That seems to be there for \\\"connectedness\\\" in the Body of Christ.  My brothers and sisters ought to be involved so that there can be some accountability on both our parts.  That's part of the concept from Hebrews about \\\"not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together as is the custom of some.\\\"  We need each other because Lone Ranger Christians and Lone Ranger Marriages smack of a self sufficiency that the I don't see in the NT.  Does anyone see the Paul Simon \\\"I am a rock, I am an island...\\\" model anywhere in Christianity. (Song lyrics show your age :-) ) ?  Further, since marriage is a legal matter/institution in the USA and many other places, and such laws do not specifically go crosswise to the clear teachings of Scripture, we ought to obey them to avoid even the appearance of \\\"evil\\\" (I Thess 5:22)  So this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage, but keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the  conscience of others because back to the beginning...you are married when you and your intended promise each other and God to be in convenant.

However, I think you should wait for version 2.0 (I think it will be out soon).\",\"  And some comments, with some players deleted.   Yep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the #1 spot.  It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.    Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean. --  Dale J.

The meaning of my existence is a question I ask myself daily.  I live  in fear of what will happen when I  die.     I bet some of you are licking your lips now, because you think that I'm a person on the edge of accepting jeezus.               I was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years of religious educational institutions..  I know the bible well. So well I can recognize many passages from memory.    <<****Strong opinions start here...****>>  1) The human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced mental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable.  (For example the ancient Greeks believed that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  Due to the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.    Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are  because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind.  \\\"Oh wow..all i have to do is  follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness.\\\" For all of you \\\"found jeezus\\\" , how many of you were \\\"on the brink?\\\"  but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.   We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we die.        Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG. Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high.   It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.  When Christians see a \\\"non-believer\\\", they say that person is blind to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet #37696  who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans were (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need.

The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.

Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound.  Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately.  I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.  I seem to recall CM pitching well initially, though I don't have stats handy.\",\" [...]  Wait a minute, Doug.  I know you are better informed than that.  The US  has never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).

We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess  we \\\"invaded\\\" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have  invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles  for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from  Spain.

I think the Kings will make it out of the first round, regardless of who they play. They seem to be doing pretty well, even with that bad game against Minnesota on Saturday. I think it'll be either Calgary or Los Angeles to win the Smythe (i.e. go on to the conference finals). \",\"From Denning:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    Where the session key is K, and is transmitted encrypted in the unit Key U. Which along with the serial number N is encrypted in the Family key F.  Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The function of this spoof chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the family key   2) Receive Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the      law enforcement block is necessary for local operation -      checksums, sequence control, etc.).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere is a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bits as used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement block can be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas, no one has proposed Federal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves, The correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits of N in E[N; F].  The one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but the mutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate the entire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme such as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block can be recovered are lessened.  What do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the serial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission becomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?  One way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block containing M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.  The goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to  detection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law enforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state for use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.  It is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within the clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for, requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting and decrypting E(M; K);  The spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including on the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products could be subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?  Super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without redress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial number.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which should not be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs for procurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough, stealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nice from a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated with a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and  distribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen clipper serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not  sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream. This could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted stream.  Detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned scheme.  ******************************************************************************  If you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and use them in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a valid law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching the remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yet deliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement block.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators, such as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.  The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream and the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between endpoints.  The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission interception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's supposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants an encryption chip with a real time clock?  *****************************************************************************\",\"# # I remember seeing something in the X distribution mentioning support # for a Tektronix terminal in an X server.

Or check out the medical dictionary cite which a doctor mentioned earlier in this thread?    Among others, see Olney's  \\\"Excitotoxic Food Aditives - Relevance of Animal Studies to Human Safety\\\" (1982) Neurobehav. Toxicol. Teratol. vol 6: 455-462.  I'm sure PETA would love to hear your arguments.   Whose talking about \\\"food science\\\"? What is this comment supposed to mean? *Neurotoxicology and Tratology*, *Brain Research*, *Nature*, *Progress in Brain Research*: all fine food science journals. ;-)   Then you would know that Olney himself has casually  referred to \\\"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\\\" in a few articles. Why don't *you* point us to some studies? Maybe then this exchange could be productive.   They're unable to metabolise it.   Who said anything about 'received wisdom'? There is no question that orally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence. These areas are responsible for the production of hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now what, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing? Are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary, ANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone?   How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It's unethical to \\\"sacrifice\\\" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food industry knows this. That's why the animal model is used in medicine and psych.  If you're talking about straight sensitivity, it would be useful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and physiology.  I suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities (You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its implication for adults (me).  Certainly the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than for the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious and increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their hidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels* attained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC.    Olney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for some sensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally administered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH is responsible not only for control of growth during development, but also converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause of headaches?

No arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is that aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of Leao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and secondary neuronal ischemia).  Migraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  There do not seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.

Personally, I have no use for changing the registration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to be solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour reinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one way or another.  So, while I'm not going to put much time into it myself, here's the procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:  1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want to install it.  I've been using c:\\\\WINSTALL myself.  2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\\\\WINORIG.  3.  Install from c:\\\\winstall.  4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.       i.e., comp *.* \\\\winorig\\\\*.* >\\\\report.txt  5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming they didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one file should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate said offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hex editor, and do the same for the modified one.  6.  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don't really do cryptography.  It's probably just an xor key or something; I think MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing his copy than with \\\"real pirates\\\" who will probably just disassemble the damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original floppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able to back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a compare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).  As I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and don't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one directory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff I've mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if they'd ever find out.

But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.   There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).  Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \\\"You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you\\\" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.   But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few:  1. \\\"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given\\\" (Matt. 13:11).  2. \\\"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\\\" (Matt. 19:11).  3. \\\"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\\\" (John 16:12).  4. \\\"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father\\\" (John 16:25).  5. \\\"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\\\" (1 Cor. 3:1-2).  6. \\\"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face\\\" (2 Jn. 1:12).  (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.   Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------          Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City                     jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu\",\"Could be due to the rear-end ratio also.

In keeping with more classic command and control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.

That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying that they are infallible.  Impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will probably agree.  In short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning, then those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved, there is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing \\\"There is no way out of the loop.\\\"   Someone called `REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but he did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase Sartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism.  As I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false because you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because   However, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX' has written does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does not like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.   *  There were two sentences in `REXLEX's post that seemed relevant to the point at hand:   I do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I have, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don't claim to be infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I do claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.  However, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about them, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier article.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted in very limited circumstances.    But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said, exactly, \\\"This is my body.\\\"  We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Why should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be fallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?  So, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is that Jesus said \\\"This is my body.\\\"  Beyond that, once we start making up doctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we get into trouble.  Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they cannot be certain.    That is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know that human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not believe we are infallible, any more than we do.  When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you are either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying to cover them up.  I think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what things we are only \\\"very confident\\\" of.  For example, we might say that we know our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But other things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical thinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are very confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.  But, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting as if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.   *  `REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by Francis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of it, but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody else might like it, though, so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.  If someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Certainty_, by Ludwig Wittgenstein. \",\"Hmmm...

I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be    contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction    and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?    What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that    Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?    This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically    stood by the Pope.  The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This is the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his departure from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands from *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be disobeyed.  My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it would be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the present situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated. Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the Catholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.     It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is    disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over    authority and discipline.    The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic Faith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the Catholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.  There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the Catholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an hour, probably.  Take the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book on what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio de Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old catechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the Catholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He innoculated the people against what was coming.  Well, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came when the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope recovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really wanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence. The Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.  The injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop was installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's clergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New Mass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass. The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop was *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The priests would just start building new churches; the people were completely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the bishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.  The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to canon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V. Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.  During all this process, the people of Campos, not just private individuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending petitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist bishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome. Eventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.     My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)     If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.    If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and    there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that    I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end of the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in Catholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an instant non-Catholic.  The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are doing, they would be shocked!     We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\"    traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter    East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.  This isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body of traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are especially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is.     I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow    error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`    I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  That's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job since the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors spread that it's pitiful.  Infallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the short term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In fact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large sections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been much more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long run.     What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement    regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how    do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?    Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.    Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,    one way or the other.  Yes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what is he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of the Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic schools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?     It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the    Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\",\" I think you can do this with REGEDIT, which can make changes to the OLE registration database.

As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the  number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility  with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the  availability of drivers for their hardware, installation  procedures, etc.   Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows  Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is  including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version  2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).   Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,  especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.  So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks  (e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or  for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read  comp.os.os2.misc for details).   Proposed Charters:   (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so   as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and   spur additional development.  The group will also cover   topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,   Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program   portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and   so forth.   (b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)    To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy   orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to   comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup   for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and   technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.   (c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)    It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the   availability of device drivers, compatibility information,   installation procedures, system requirements, and overall   performance optimization.   (d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.   (e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug   diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system   patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.    [Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other   newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in   comp.os.os2.beta]   How to Vote:   To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.  Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this  post.  Be sure to send only the ballot, and edit out the rest of  this post.   1)  Type in your vote for each proposal:       If you favor the charter as proposed, put a \\\"yes\\\" after its name.      If you oppose the charter as proposed, put a \\\"no\\\" after its name.      To abstain, leave a blank after its name.   2)  Type in your last name (i.e. your family name), a comma, and      your first name (i.e. your personal name).   3)  Cut out the ballot,  Please do not delete any lines of the      ballot.   4)  E-mail your ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu before 11:59:59 pm      (Central Time), April 24, 1993.   Ballot:  ----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----          (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting:         (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc:         (c)              comp.os.os2.setup:         (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:         (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs:          (f)       voter's last, first name:          e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24  ----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------   Example Ballot #1:   (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes  (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes  (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no  (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:  (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: no   (f)       voter's last, first name: Smith, John   In this example, John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting  to be created, and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to  comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of  comp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view  on the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia.    Example Ballot #2:   (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes  (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes  (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes  (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes  (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes   (f)       voter's last, first name: Doe, Jane   In this example, Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all  the proposals.   Voting Rules:   * One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most    recent vote will be counted.   * Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,    forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.   * Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings    will be revealed only after the poll closes.   * I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will    post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).   * If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how    voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.    Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is    posted to news.answers on a regular basis.   * If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this    CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.   * When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal    passes if both of the following formulas are true:    1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes        by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).    2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the        number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).    In other words, a proposal passes if:        YES - NO >= max (100, NO)    where max() returns the highest number given to it.   Schedule:   The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted  by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).   This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the  Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who  have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you  have not voted yet, vote now!   The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on  April 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.  The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that  date.   Mass Acknowledgement:   Here is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots  as of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15, 1993:                            bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu Aiyagari,

Islamic Fundamentalists just have a \\\"better\\\" excuse (Qu'ran).       from the Vancouver Sun, Thursday, October 4, 1990     by John Davidson, Canadian Press       MONTREAL-- Perhaps it's the letter to the five-year old     daughter that shocks the most.       \\\"I hope one day you will be old enough to understand what     happened to your parents,\\\" wrote Patrick Prevost. \\\"I loved     your mother with a passion that went as far as hatred.\\\"       Police found the piece of paper near Prevost's body in his     apartment in northeast Montreal.       They say the 39-year-old mechanic committed suicide after     killing his wife, Jocelyne Parent, 31.       The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had     gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money     for food. A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked     his wife with a kitchen knife, cutting her throat, police said.       She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or     lover in Quebec in the last five weeks.       Five children have also been slain as a result of the same     domestic \\\"battles.\\\"       Last year in Quebec alone, 29 [women] were slain by their     husbands. That was more than one-third of such cases across     Canada, according to statistics from the Canadian Centre for     Justice. [rest of article ommited]   Then to say that women are somehow \\\"better\\\" or \\\"should\\\" be the one to \\\"stay home\\\" and raise a child is also laughable. Women have traditionally done hard labor to support a family, often  more than men in many cultures, throughout history.

Detweiler <ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu>.   <8.1> What are some known anonymous remailing and posting sites? <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity? <8.3> How do I `kill' anonymous postings? <8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers? <8.5> What is the value of anonymity? <8.6> Should anonymous posting to all groups be allowed? <8.7> What should system operators do with anonymous postings? <8.8> What is going on with anon.penet.fi maintained by J. Helsingius?   * * *  _____ <8.1> What are some known anonymous remailing and posting sites?    Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites   is anon.penet.fi operated by julf@penet.fi for several months, who   has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment.    Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses    (no encryption).  Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.     Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk   remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):   pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX   scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to   aid remailer use).    ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu   -----------------------------     Anonymized mail.  Request information from above address.        elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu   -------------------------     Experimental anonymous remailer run Karl Barrus     <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU>, with encryption to the server.

Request information from above address.    phantom@mead.u.washington.edu    -----------------------------     Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site     address for information.    Notes   =====      - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often     running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues     are wholly unresolved.      - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP     software (see the question on cryptography).     - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)     vary between sites.    - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are     mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.  _____ <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?       Users   -----    - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the     seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.   - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.   - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on     Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.   - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.     Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases     network traffic.   - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this     is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'     hierarchy is preferred.   - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.     references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for     readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any     inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even     future ones under the same handle.   - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your     identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by     sending anonymized mail to yourself.   - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them.      Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.   - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.   - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.     Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.   - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large     amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating     his hardware, all for your convenience.    Operators   ---------    - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an     introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and     consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and     monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and     security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or     lassaiz-faire?   - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate     potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user     is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user     posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your     users trust you to protect them.   - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations     where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.     warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke     the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)   - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.     Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly     and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with     users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under     ``(in)stability of anonymity''.   - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?     What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is     your commitment to it?   - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an     address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item.      Consult a lawyer about your liability.   - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared     to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you     do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system     adminstrator, consult those who do and are.   - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If     possible, query group readers.   - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message     format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure     the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.   - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from     physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.    Readers   -------      - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason     that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that     equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail     anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its     volume is heavy or increasing).   - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters     will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate     responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.   - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,     harassment, extortion, etc.   - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they     offend you personally.   - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the     idea of anonymity itself.   - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings     should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or     `conceivable' need exists.    References   ----------      See e.g. ftp.eff.org:/pub/academic/anonymity:    > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual   > privacy and the use of handles.  It accepts the need of a system   > operator to know the name of a user; but suggests that the use of   > a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a   > letter to the editor. The article concludes with a set of   > guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous.  _____ <8.3> How do I `kill' anonymous postings?    James Thomas Green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>:    > Try putting this in your kill file:   >      >   /Anon/h:j   >   /Anonymous/h:j   >    > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that   > contain `Anon' or `Anonymous' in them.  Not perfect and won't   > kill followups.       Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask   anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so   far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common   as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.    _____ <8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?    Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for   individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is   almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion   and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack   started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was   wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)   but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided   anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up   the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous   alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through   servers like there's no tomorrow.''      Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in   researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste   <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system   from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the   server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,   and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by   multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended   advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group   support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was   arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.''    K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an   anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus   against it.     K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to   `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and   used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of   intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his   server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to   abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the   facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was   created.''    In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most   controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on   scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized   mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine   the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide   accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.      J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet   newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological   opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).   Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,   abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than   ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of   anonymity is also controversial.    For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb   1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate   crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via   anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been   posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then   non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a   New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of   vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating   through many newsgroups.       The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded   that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''   suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was   not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of   the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived   association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries   for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous   user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his   detractors.    Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal   opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news   operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire   extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the   scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is   best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users   in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a   day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized   through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due   to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to   find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.    Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to   dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste   threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate   news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages   originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to   threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several   times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it   by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5   hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the   service's administration. In response to the serious threats he   disabled global group access temporarily for one week and   encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.      Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by   ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security   weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is   currently in the process of code development and testing. He is   planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon   to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new   system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple   email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,   etc.    A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.   1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography   in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of   confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public   access account, and he had to shut it down after only several   weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately   originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the   software to the public domain.    Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on   government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and   group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the   group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,   and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable   digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in   the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to   attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing   easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and   encryption.

I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now. The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it. A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi). The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards.  (He said he will replace the components before selling the car to me.)  Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don't know what this could mean... Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items? Or is this an indication that the car was abused? Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon? The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but, I don't know how to verify this...  I've seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though.  Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept, it's currently out of warranty (a similarly priced '90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km worth of warranty left) and I don't want to worry about paying for any repair bills... But, I also need a car for 5 people...    When will the new Maxima come out, by the way?  I would very much appreciate your input in this. Please reply by e-mail (preferred) or post in this newsgroup. Thanks!  Ryan  \",\" [rest deleted...]  You were a liberal arts major, weren'tcha?

Steve> Steve Frysinger  Your might take a look a PLPLOT.  Version 4.99c (actually beta v5.0) can be found anonymous ftp from hagar.ph.utexas.edu, in the pub/plplot  directory.    --Mark  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------    From the README file of version 4.99c:   This is the PLPLOT distribution.  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for  many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size  and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard  x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,  bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)  may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different  line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of  distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in  the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek  alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts  can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device  drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile  format and renderer.   The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.  The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly  granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without  consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT  object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it  is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely  available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed  somewhere in the documentation for the package.   We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of  user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any  published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,  which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that  as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the  kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest  in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only  afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on  those which help us get our work done.   PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically  without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub  routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any  modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the  header file \\\"plplot.h\\\"; see the documentation for more details.   The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of  several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex  plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to  the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained  there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.     At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:    Unix: SunOS    A/IX     HP-UX    Unicos    DG/UX    Ultrix    SysV    Linux    Amiga/Exec   MS-DOS   OS/2   NeXT   For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:   - appendices to the PLPLOT manual   - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

EMAIL   amr@egr.duke.edu\",\" I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of the discussion: one the dice are out there, it won't be long before someone decaps it and, after a bit of work, has full details of the Clipper algorythm.  This isn't trivial to do, but then again, it is not impossibly difficult either.  Any half way decent VLSI design student should be able to take a photograph of a technology s/he is familiar with, and given a description of the input, output, control and supply lines, figure out  the function of various subsystems on the die.  Indeed, this is not an uncommon exercise performed during training (because it makes you think about design decisions made by other designers.  I could speculate that these chips are going to be manufactured using \\\"tamperproof\\\" carriers (unlikely - such techniques are *very* expensive and this thing is supposed to be relatively cheap to produce), or that there will be some legal or legislative framework to prevent publication of the algorythm (unlikely - please correct me if I am wrong but aren't these supposed to be sold internationally?).  I suppose that the most likely reason the algorythm is remaining secret for the moment is that some idiot bureaucrat, untrammeled by the realities of the situation, decided that \\\"well, we should keep it a secret because it is supposed to be secret, isn't it?\\\"  Just some random thoughts... \",\"Hello everyone.  I'm new to motorcycles so no flames please.  I don't have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:  1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have  to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too  ignorant to know I need to buy)  2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in  about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a  motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes a difference)  3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?  4)  In DC, as I imagine it is in every other state (OK, OK, we're not a  state - we're not bitter ;)), you take the written test first and then get a learners permit.  However, I'm wondering how one goes about  learning to ride the bike proficiently enough so as to a) get a liscence and b) not kill oneself.  I don't know anyone with a bike who could  teach me, and the most advice I've heard is either \\\"do you live near a field\\\" or \\\"do you have a friend with a pickup truck\\\", the answers to both of which are NO.  Do I just ride around my neighborhood and hope for  the best?  I kind of live in a residential area but it's not suburbs. It's still the big city and I'm about a mile from downtown so that  doesn't seem too viable.  Any stories on how you all learned?

One reply, which I have lost, suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses, one  of which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan.  By coincidence, last week's _America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles  Bourke, Corpus Christi's pastor emeritus.  Fr. Bourke also directed the NT  translation in the New American Bible.  He noted \\\"...certain practices have  been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality,  and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy.\\\"  I note that at my  parents' parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the  offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word \\\"risen\\\".  This was not a  kiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 Mass.  I wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies.  This newsgroup as a whole offers generally moderate (perhaps because it's moderated) conversation on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself). Sometimes people do go over the top, but the remarkable thing is how that is the exception, I think.  Benefits of the doubt are generally granted.  It seems so...Christian?\",\" As am I  If \\\"high quality secure NSA classified technology\\\" means handing my key over to whomever, I'll take PGP any day.  Right now they are billing it as voluntary, i.e. bend over, here it comes.  As soon as enough Wiretap chip based units are out there, how much easier do you think it will be to redefine \\\"on your own\\\" to mean write it yourself and don't even THINK about distributing it...?  Get honest, no one is going to buy this trash if they KNOW it's compromised already, and less will buy it if the algorithm is not disclosed.  The NSA knows that making this stuff available to the public means handing it to whatever foreign powers are interested in the process. Since when has export control stopped anyone (especially software wise)  Ask yourself carefully if \\\" high quality secure NSA classified technology \\\" is something they are going to hand out.

This is true for all Israeli citizens no matter what their ethnicity. In the United States most official forms have RACE (Caucasian, Black, AmerIndian, etc.).   Funny, I have a number of maps and ALL of them have fixed borders.     Probably yes. So what ?      Apart from Mordechai Vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors, there was one other espionage case (the nutty professor at the Nes Ziona Biological Institute who was a K.G.B. mole) who was tried \\\"in camera\\\". I wouldn't exactly call it a state secret. The trial was simply tried behind closed doors. I hate to disappoint you but the United States has tried a number of espionage cases in camera.    Not Jews. Israeli citizens. Jordanian law is in effect in the West Bank but the KNESSET passed a law that Israeli law would be binding on Israeli citizens residing in the West Bank. These citizens could be Jews, Israeli Muslims, Druze, or Israeli Christians. It has NOTHING to do with religion.      Anyone who was registered (Jew, Muslim, Christian) could return. You might be confusing this with the census taken in June 1967 on the West Bank after the Six Day War. In *this* instance, if the Arab was not physically present he couldn't reside on the West Bank (e.g. if he had been visting Jordan).    No. Not even if you drowned him in bourbon, scotch or brandy :-)     Not true. Although a minority, there *are* some Israeli Arabs living on kibbutzim. On the other hand, at my age (42) I wouldn't be admitted to a kibbutz nor could the family join me. Not that I would be so thrilled to do so in the first place. The kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorous membership criteria. Many Israeli Jews are not admitted.    The religious status quo in Israel has marriage and divorce  handled by the religious courts. The RABBANUT handles marriage and divorce for Jews, the Muslim SHAARIA  courts are for Muslims, the Christian denominations have their religious courts, and the Druze have their own courts. The entire religious establishment (Jewish, Muslim, Druze, Christian) wants to keep it that way.   I believe it's adjacent to a former Muslim cemetary. From what I heard (and I'd like to get feedback from Muslins  on the net) sanctity of cemetaries is not held that sancrosanct as it is held by Jews. The current Israeli Ministry of Trade and Industry on Agron Road in Jerusalem is housed in a former hotel that was built by Arabs in the 1920's on the site of an Arab cemetary.

Charley,  I can't help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous posts.  I submit that you don't answer them because you cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once again challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for you as possible, I'll present concise re-statements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see.  Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I will re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at such time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this newsgroup.  I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be kind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it from this list.  Now, to the questions...  1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating that you weren't referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some atheists who you feel don't fit your patterns, to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your stereotype?  Here is the context for the question:    2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that \\\"senses and reason are all we have to go by\\\", and when pressed, you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...   then later...   then later...    3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by a.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify one such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical?  If so, please repeat them.  Here is the context for the question:    then later...    4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the \\\"axioms\\\" of reason that one couldn't help but become atheist.  I asked you to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that I have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer the question.  Please do so now.  Question: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that effect?  If you don't retract that claim, do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism?  Here is the context for the question:  [First quote] [Second quote]   5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these Challenges because they contained too much in the way of \\\"included text\\\" from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn't respond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify this seeming contradiction.  Question:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context from your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to avoid \\\"included text\\\"?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...

So, rather than be something secular, it is something  SHK> very sacred.  I would go further, and say that much of the damage to the environment has been caused by the secular worldview, or by the humanist worldview, and especially by the secular humanist worldview.  This is not to say that ALL secular humanists are necessarily avid destroyers of the environment, and I am sure that there are many who are concerned about the environment. But at the time of the Renaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre, or the focus of culture (hence \\\"humanism\\\"). This consciousness was also secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the present age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the same time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy. This doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it began to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European society and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later stages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that justified  them.  There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of \\\"economics\\\" - from the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces and powers. There were denominational differences among the new worshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was \\\"the free rein of the market mechanism\\\", while for others it was \\\"the dialectical forces of history\\\". But in both the capitalist West and the socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of Mammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to oppose what was happening and state their case.

I think that even interception of the crypttext    without a warrant would be illegal.

Jim \",\" Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI-1 for hard drives YES the \\\"figure includes a hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers\\\"  This is sloppy people and DUMB.  Ok once again with the SCSI spec list: SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s  asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s. SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}  Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1  so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too.  SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit  hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1  devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds} SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak: Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower  {Range 0-5MB/s}  One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by people.  Its PROPER meaning is \\\"The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2\\\" Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote: (My comments in {})  PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 \\\"Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI, {This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE...\\\" {this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2} To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read: {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} \\\"Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the  speed of IDE...\\\" or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2} \\\"Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as ESDI, 20% faster than IDE...\\\"  NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.  SCSI-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 drivers  are VERY expansive {8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 drivers with little speed degridation(the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this.)}\",\"Having run completely out of time, I've got to get my prophesies and predictions for the A.L. out.  Qualifications -- one of the worse finishes in last year's prediction contest.  AL East -- 1993  1.  Baltimore Orioles Why the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to this:   -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.   -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees   -- Milwaukee was a fluke   -- Indians aren't ready to contend   -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better   -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of \\\"replacement level\\\" \\\"But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.\\\"  No.  As a matter of fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division on paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some- body has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  \\\"You don't really think that Brady Anderson is going to repeat, do you?\\\"  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  \\\"Glenn Davis?  That's insane\\\".  Yes.  So, without further ado: STRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken. WEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be   the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.   (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize   the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3   spot, why not move the rest of the line up?) WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota. ObPrediction:  \\\"The Streak\\\" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in   caught stealing.  2. New York Yankees. STRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American   League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes. WEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner    factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far   behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to   win a division. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300 WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again. ObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.  3.  Toronto Blue Jays STRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie   power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.   Guzman.  Alomar. WEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.   Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in   the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August. ObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And   have a losing record.  4.  Milwaukee Brewers STRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year. WEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year. WOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year. ObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.  5.  Cleveland Indians STRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy WEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix   Fermin. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace. ObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.  6.  Boston Red Sox STRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens WEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre   Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL ObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how   you will :->  7.  Detroit Tigers STRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker WEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.   Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.   This year could be *very* ugly. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP. ObPrediction:  Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs.  One more division to go.... --  Dale J.

I made a decision to accept the truth-claims of Christianity after having given it a lot of thought.  (I have to point out that the process was not purely a cold, rational one: there was a powerful experiential element as well. Also, my Calvinist should rest assured that I don't lay any of the responsibility for the outcome [my conversion] on anyone but God.)  It took me years and years for this all to happen, because I had many of the objections that this poster puts forward.  I grew up in the shadow of [generic authoritarian conservative denomination], and I *knew* that that wasn't a way of life that I could adopt.  But I gradually learned not to tar all of Christianity with the same brush, and realized quite suddenly one cold winter night that I accepted what I had heretofore rejected.

I   mean, heck, if Dave Winfield (ho-hum) is seriously being considered for it, as  is Lee Smith (ha), then why don't we give Dave Kingman a chance? Or Darrell  Evans! Yeah, yeah! After the Hall of Fame takes in them, it can take in Eddie  Murray and Jeff Reardon.       Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody giving  Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards, marginal.  Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both  shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.       Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so  liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if something  isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When  certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential  candidates, the absurdity is apparent.

But there are some very important related facts that            Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of            most other world religions.                             First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-           STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master            (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES,            a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and            after the life of Jesus.                      The followers of some of these Masters founded the            world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of            their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added            THREATS of \\\"ETERNAL DAMNATION\\\" in Hell, and DELETED the            teaching of REincarnation.                         Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular            Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is            NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively            few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY            alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE            UNIVERSES.)                                              Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and            pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from            their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed            themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly            MANUFACTURED by the Romans.                        And emotional \\\"feelings\\\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING            indicator for religious validity.                      These things are similarly true for followers of most            other major world religions, including Islam.                       Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune            His Initiates into the \\\"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\\\" or \\\"SOUND            CURRENT\\\", (referred to as \\\"THE WORD\\\" in John 1:1-5, and as            \\\"The River of Life\\\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally            guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they            are still connected to their living physical bodies by a            \\\"silver cord\\\".                      True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of            REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved            only by reaching at least the \\\"SOUL PLANE\\\", which is five            levels or universes above the physical universe, and this            canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine            Master.                      One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri            Harold Klemp, the Living \\\"Eck\\\" Master or \\\"Mahanta\\\" for the            \\\"Eckankar\\\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis,            (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427).                      Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now            living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \\\"Sant            Mat\\\" organization.                        One of the classic books on this subject is \\\"THE PATH OF            THE MASTERS\\\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA             90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian            and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India            studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of            that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji.                      Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored            by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in            most public and university libraries and some book stores, or            obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \\\"ECKANKAR--THE            KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\\\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER            classic.                      Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with            the \\\"Anti-Christ\\\", which is or was to be a temporary world            dictator during the so-called \\\"last days\\\".  But the Masters            don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as            Jesus was.                      People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or            other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will            CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the            Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they            finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine            Master.                                 RE-INCARNATION                           The book \\\"HERE AND HEREAFTER\\\", by Ruth Montgomery,            describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation            as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past            lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes            makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist],            SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of            whom can identify their most recent previous relatives,            homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-           ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-           ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-           ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS            FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the            Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How            can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED            BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \\\"KING JAMES VERSION\\\".  Later            versions are PER-VERSIONS! ]                            Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc.,            typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example,            a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually            results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.             And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to            another person being met for the first time in THIS life,            because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS            INCARNATION.                  The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF            KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would            behave much better toward each other if they knew that their            actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the            future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION!               \\\"2nd COMINGS\\\"                 If a Divine Master physically dies (\\\"translates\\\")            before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that            Initiate physically dies (\\\"translates\\\"), the Master will meet            him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul            Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd            Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that            happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still            waiting for Jesus' \\\"2nd Coming\\\" are WAITING IN VAIN.                                       PLANES OF EXISTENCE                 The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN            major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the            Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric            Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane),            the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The            Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from            the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the            Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes.                      It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological            influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See            the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without            an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between            the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane.                      The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a            sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \\\"Hades\\\", and the            Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there            LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some            kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a            THREATENING manner.  The Christian \\\"Heaven\\\" is located            elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there            for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth.                                             SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH                 The Christian religion demands of its followers an            extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more            than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING).

I'm looking for books that showing how to fix your own hardware problem.  Please let me know if you have any books in mind.  Thanks. \",\" I agree with what Darren has to say here, but would like to add a  personal observation.  What I see as arrogance and the problem I have  with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just  Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.    Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal  sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these  matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them  but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus  anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that leads to arrogance.  In my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)    comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\",\"Hi Xperts, some simple questions for you:  I've seen a lot of different terms, which seem to mean the same thing.

(I think it was glues and such, as well as electronics, that they were worried about.)  Thus it had to remain furled and the axis _always_ pointed near the sun, so that the small sunshade at the tip of the antenna mast would shadow the folded HGA. (A larger sunshade beneath the antenna shielded the spacecraft bus.)\",\" Let's get back to basics.  Canon (from the latin) means a rule.  If we say that a rule is open then its a rule made to be broken.   There is an issue also of measurement against a rule.  Thus the words that are spoken need to be compared against the rule/canon but not added to the canon.  Is new revelation necessary?  Topical, current, personal revelation I'd say is necessary.  New revelation for all people for all times is not necessary as we have that in Scripture.  You also seem to confuse canon with scripture.  Scripture may speak of itself being open - ie God speaking today.  It would speak that it is closed in the sense that the canon is unchangeable.  (Though the concept of canon is later historically.)   I agree with the problem of confusion.  If prophecy is meant to encourage, exhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture.  If prophecy is meant to bring a `word' of the form \\\"the man you live with is not your husband\\\" then that is knowledge.  Yet the exact words their are scripture. I would expect the difference to be the motive and means for delivery. The reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force.  Regards  David\",\"  Note that I said the fall of Rome, not of the Empire.  The Roman Empire lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The main reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by the men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city of Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of Mazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter of time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto the rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle should be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of Constantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greeks had wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the Crusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd Crusades?  Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they considered heretics, even though those \\\"heretics\\\" were fighting for the cause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkish hordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the some hordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third of Europe (the Balkans, Hungary, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.)\",\"The system, or 'family', key would appear to be cryptographically useless, since *every* chip must know it and be able to remove its effects from the bitstream.

It is the \\\"X Window System\\\", or \\\"X11\\\", or \\\"X\\\" or any of a number of other designations accepted by the X Consortium.  In fact, doing \\\"man X\\\" on pretty much any X11 machine will tell you:       The X Consortium requests that the following names  be  used      when referring to this software:                                    X                            X Window System                              X Version 11                      X Window System, Version 11                                  X11  There is no such thing as \\\"X Windows\\\" or \\\"X Window\\\", despite the repeated misuse of the forms by the trade rags.

With regard to dialup X11 implementations, there are several.  You can buy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both  GraphOn and NCD.

NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is NCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such  software packages available.  X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running X11 over low-speed connections.

Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.  I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?  Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost?  I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?

An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing     asteroids.      Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor     Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in     diameter.

The latter was written with     simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind     (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).      More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John     Snyder's USGS publication \\\"Map Projections--A Working Manual\\\", USGS     Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32     projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both     spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a     neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.      You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,     \\\"An Album of Map Projections\\\", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This     contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are     in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.      You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:     Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National     Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and     tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.      A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos,     (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call     them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a     check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up     for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.      A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:   R. Miller and F. Reddy, \\\"Mapping the World in Pascal\\\",  Byte V12 #14, December 1987   Contains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections. A  demo program, CARTOG.PAS, and a small (6,000 point) coastline data  is available on CompuServe, GEnie, and many BBSs.      Some references for spherical trignometry are:   _Spherical Astronomy_, W.M. Smart, Cambridge U. Press, 1931.   _A Compendium of Spherical Astronomy_, S. Newcomb, Dover, 1960.   _Spherical Astronomy_, R.M. Green, Cambridge U. Press., 1985 (update  of Smart).   _Spherical Astronomy_, E Woolard and G.Clemence, Academic  Press, 1966.

SKY (UNIX EPHEMERIS PROGRAM)      The 6th Edition of the Unix operating system came with several software     systems not distributed because of older media capacity limitations.     Included were an ephmeris, a satellite track, and speech synthesis     software. The ephmeris, sky(6), is available within AT&T and to sites     possessing a Unix source code license. The program is regarded as Unix     source code. Sky is <0.5MB. Send proof of source code license to   E.

Convert parallax into distance using the     formula in part 6 of the FAQ, convert RA and declination to coordinates     on a unit sphere (see some of the references on planetary positions and     spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this), and     scale this by the distance.      Two databases useful for this purpose are the Yale Bright Star catalog     (sources listed in FAQ section 3) or \\\"The Catalogue of Stars within 25     parsecs of the Sun\\\" (in pub/SPACE/FAQ/stars.data and stars.doc on     ames.arc.nasa.gov). \",\"I am looking for Ultima V for the IBM, I would like the entire package (meaning I need more than just the game, I would like the Docs also) Since it is an old game I do not want to pay a lot of money. If you are interested in selling this game please respond to this message. \",\"Can anybody tell me how to use the Xmu function \\\"XmuCvtStringToWidget\\\". I want to specify a widget name in a resource file so that I can connect two widgets together on an XmForm. ie.  MyProggy*MyListSW.topWidget:               MainTextSW  However, when I run the program, I get the message:  Warning: No type converter registered for 'String' to 'Window' conversion.  (Just like the manual sez).  I have managed to find this bit of code which seems to be the correct way to go about this:      static XtConvertArgRec parentCvtArgs[] = {         {             XtWidgetBaseOffset,             (XtPointer)XtOffsetOf( CoreRec, core.parent ),             sizeof(CoreWidget)         }     };      XtSetTypeConverter( XtRString, XtRWidget, XmuCvtStringToWidget,                             parentCvtArgs, XtNumber(parentCvtArgs), XtCacheAll,                                NULL );   However, I haven't got a clue where to put it! The example code I have seems to suggest I can only do this if I am creating my own widget; but elsewhere it says that I can add it to a widget's \\\"class_intialize\\\" function. HOW? What's one of those? :-(  If anybody has any code to do this, please let me know the trick - I'm sure this is a FAQ.  Thanks in advance,  Rik.

That you're willing to throw out freedom-of-speech for the sake of protecting the reputation of the royal sluts.  That the British government advertised in American newspapers \\\"Send A Gun to Defend a British Home -- British civilians, faced with threat of invasion, desperately need arms for the defense of their homes.\\\" during WWII.  [American Rifleman November, 1940]  That The Obscene Publications Act and the Misuse of Drugs Act have been used as justification for the police to seize masterpieces such as William S. Burrough's \\\"Junky\\\", Hunter Thompson's \\\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\\", and Tom Wolfe's \\\"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\\\".  British courts have never recognized the right to assemble or to demonstrate.  That evidence obtained form coerced confessions is allowed in a trial.  That only serious felonies warrant a trial by jury.  That suspected terrorists must prove their innocence, instead of the government having to prove their guilt.  That the secretary of state may issue an \\\"exclusionary order\\\" which bars someone from ever entering a particular part of the United Kingdom, such as Northern Ireland or Wales.  That the BBC banned Paul McCartney's \\\"Give Ireland Back to the Irish\\\" as well as John Lennon's \\\"Give Peace a Chance\\\" during the Gulf War.  Yes, England is very very funny.  And very pathetic.   So what.  Laughter is a way of dealing with things we find uncomfortable. I thought the \\\"Las Vegas Show Girl\\\" ads on Las Vegas street corners were pretty funny.  Yes indeed, there are many strange and wonderous things in this country. I wouldn't have it any other way.   I don't disagree with that, I don't think it's bad either.   So what.  If they didn't come from here they would come from elsewhere disguised as cocaine.   You can laugh all you want, for us it's a matter of life or death. I don't find that funny in the least.  As for England:  \\\"As our allies become more open, Britain grow yet more secretive and censorious.  Perhaps the real British vice is passivity, a willingness to tolerate constraints which others would find unbearble.\\\" [in \\\"Britain, An Unfree Country\\\" by Terrence DeQuesne and Edward Goodman, pp 33.]\",\" Personally, i wouldn't use the $1.29 product from KMart. I knew about this previously, but this past weekend on PBS's MotorWeek Pat Goss  (their resident tech type) discussed these products, and recommends not using them (i.e, the non-isopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners).  Supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors.  And although the  others (ethyl based) do clean injectors they also cause rubber  components in the fuel system to deteriorate, and they don't mix well with water to help remove it from the fuel system.  I use a product recommended by VW called 44K (by BG Products, Inc.). It cost more about $14.00, but it is supposed to do the job without the potential harmful side effects, and its results are supposed to  last from 2k to 4k miles. I have also used Chevron's Techtrolene (sp?).  I can't say that i have noticed any difference using either, since i  only use these product as a preventative maintenance item.                                                     .                                                    /                 Larry                            __/    _______/_                  keys@csmes.ncsl.nist.gov       /                  \\\\                                          _____     __     _____    \\\\------- ===             ----------- / ____/   /  /   /__  __/              \\\\          /     ___    /  / ___   /  /      / /    ____          |         |    /      \\\\/ /__ /  | /  /__  __/ /__ /       \\\\      /          /___         \\\\_______/ /_____/ /______/            ====OO             \\\\       /                           \\\\       /                          -            1990 2.0 16v           -          ---------------- FAHRVERGNUGEN FOREVER! --------------------                         The fact that I need to explain it to you indicates             that you probably wouldn't understand anyway!\",\"---------- cut here ---------- part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

Thus, Hasan is wrong.   The word \\\"troops\\\" is unjustified.  There has never been any evidence that there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the village apart from the villagers defending themselves.  According to the Haganah observer Pa'il, the Irgun/Lehi forces suffered a lot of casualties because they were incompetent soldiers.  When they ran into trouble securing the central part of the village, a small group  of Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty. Begin's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of the major inaccuracies (to use a kind word) in his account.  Incidentally, \\\"three times as heavy\\\" may be correct, as there is serious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives than to the oft-quoted 250 lives.  However, note that Begin compares wounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number of wounded Arabs.  Guess why.   As is thoroughly established by many sources, the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a usueful warning.   It is worth noting how Begin disputes the standard myth that the Palestinian Arabs fled as part of a calculated plan.   Apparently 90% of Israeli historians are Jew-haters.   I have previously posted quotations by Irgun participants that totally destroys Begin's whitewash.  I have no particular desire to post it yet again.\",\"[..]  This statement simply amazes me!  \\\"Through no fault of ATF, the element of   surprise was lost\\\"!  What element of surprise?

At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war, that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It's like they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was \\\"nice and clean\\\" (smart missiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead, dying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!   [ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]                             ^^^^^^^^^  I should have said here \\\"militarily justified\\\".  It seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning \\\"morally justified\\\". I apologize.   I have often wondered about this.  I've always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk.  A good, inpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could've been held back for use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.  Yes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately, the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's ulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.   I don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the  circumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the suffering caused by those decisions.    [...]   Actually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US and allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other back-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene.  Not that we don't care, but we can't be the world's policman.  Or if a coup had occured in Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to Saudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil  interests, caused us to take action.   [...]  I'm not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the war, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep Kuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.  Well, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler would lead their nation to.   They suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much? The world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable, but that's The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.  [...]  Probably because we're not the saviors of the world.  We can't police each and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or some other places.  Tell me how we could stop them and I'll support it.  I, for one, do not agree with the present US policy of \\\"sucking up to them\\\" as you put it. I agree that it is deplorable.   Are they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order.)  I'm not an expert on California law, or even US law, but it seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize the system, but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial  prejudice thrown around.   No, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.   Germans, perhaps.  \\\"Peers\\\" doesn't mean \\\"those who do the same thing\\\", like having murderers judge murderers.  It means \\\"having people from the same station in life\\\", presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendent's motivation(s).   OK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your* logical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.  The media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing liberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)  BTW, I never used the word \\\"conspiracy\\\".  I don't accept (without *far* more evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.   Hardly.  I didn't say that it's a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people if the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn't say it is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.   I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering.  I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved. And perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  That doesn't mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as being necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it.  But don't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I don't!  I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances.   You certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist. I, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.   Wrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply refuse to condemn them for their decision.  One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action; even this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of that, and I am prepared to do so.  I don't believe that you can make the same claim.   And BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being  \\\"so deplorable\\\".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War, precision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted *in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians (proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing in WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some civilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories of \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk. Yes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But  we are expected to swallow that \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of  *civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with  the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!   What hogwash.  If \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi civilians died,  it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to  the Allied bombing.

It also means the odometer is just as easy (or hard) to change as any other mechanical odometer.

Genesis 15:6, \\\"And he (Abram) believed the LORD; and He reckoned    it to him as righteousness\\\".     I don't find anywhere that God restricts heaven to particular    ethnic groups or religious denominations or any other category    that we humans like to drop people into. But He does REQUIRE    that we believe and trust Him. In Hebrews it says that God spoke    of old by the prophets (the old testament), but in these last days    he has spoken to us by His son Jesus Christ. And we learn of    Him through the pages of the New Testament. The Bible tells us    what we need to believe. For those who have never heard, I leave    them in God's capable care, He will make himself known as he    desires. It behooves each one of us to act upon the knowledge    we have. If you reject the claims of Jesus, and still go to    heaven, then the joke's on me. If you reject him and go to hell,    that's no joke, but it will be final.

The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them. They certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true position.   The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question. The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914 and David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.     The system is meant to be slow to react, the problem is that it ended up a bit too slow.    The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate. Until Bush abused it in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent of being a check on unreasonable legislation. The veto was clearly regarded  as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive.\",\"Note:  This file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.      ---------------------------------------------------                           THE WHITE HOUSE                    Office of the Press Secretary  _________________________________________________________________  For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993                   STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY   The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?\",\"Has anyone had any experience with a replacement comm driver for windows called TurboComm.

What    follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.     [Reproduced without permission]      The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,  where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under  the tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,  presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if  a person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group  of 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and  sugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after  drinking the artificially sweetened beverage.     The study received widespread media attention and stirred a  good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.  However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers  did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did  actually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not  necessarily go hand in hand.     In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining  the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.  And after reviewing every one of them, the director of the  Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins  University, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-  sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in  the amount of food eaten afterward.      One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing  cancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a  host of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government  has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing  everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.  Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and  after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm  that it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the  Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with  monitoring public health), the American Medical Association's  Council on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration  have given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a  clean bill of health.     Granted, the FDA has set forth an \\\"acceptable daily intake\\\" of  50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed  the limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take  in 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of  aspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,  or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...  A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams  of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups  of yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content  of selected foods omitted]     Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away  from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called  phenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000  to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential  amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child  consumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause  such severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with  PKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other  aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \\\"Phenylketonurics:  Contains Phenylalanine.\\\" \",\" If you agree that good works have a role somewhere, you will  generally find yourself in one of two camps:      (1) Faith + Works --> Salvation or (2) Faith --> Salvation + Works  Either (1) works are required for salvation, or (2) faith will  inevitably result in good works.   I am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone, based on Ephesians 2 and Romans 3:21-31.  I also conclude that James 2, when  read in context, is teaching bullet (2) above. When James speaks of  justification, I would claim that he is not speaking of God declaring the believing sinner innocent in His sight (Paul's use of the word).  Instead he is speaking of the sinner's profession of faith being  \\\"justified\\\" or \\\"proven\\\" by the display of good works. Also according  to James 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a \\\"dead\\\" or  \\\"useless\\\" faith which fails to save.  James 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it is teaching (2).  Works would have their place, not as merit toward  salvation, but as evidence of true faith.

Now I'd like to describe it in detail:  The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere.  This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used. The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold internationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!! How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?  I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear) is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not analytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things complicated. Please give me a hint.  I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not. However, so many people involved in the problem \\\"sphere from 4 poits\\\". Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?

In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This  completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2  could do, since context was unknown to it.

That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't  have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get   (RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.  The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is significant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the fit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to  the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark, Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to  add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.  It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it could just be Ozzie.  The results:                             RBI-HR          Years        Actual   Predicted Carter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6 Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6 Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8 Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6  I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.

Around a million Americans every year defend themselves with firearms.  In many of these cases the defender doesn't even have to fire a shot!  The mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the deterrent that is needed.  I don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  But, taking away the right of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent crime problem in this country.  If honest, law-abiding citizens are unable to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will be able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling guns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns should be banned by the Klintonistas.   Statistics, por favor?   See my previous post.  That ought to set you straight.   People have the right to keep and bear arms no matter what the Constitution says.  That means that even if the 2nd Amendment is repealed the *people* (that's all American citizens FYI) will *still* have the right to keep and bear arms.

Again from my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}: Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some   specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller   specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a  SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2  which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it   needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be   very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst   {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and  reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between  SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.  IBM HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: [...] IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.  So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES  the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can. The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}\",\"A fine 26 year history came to a close tonight, as the Minnesota North Stars,  or Norm's Stars (whichever you prefer) lost to the Red Wings by a score of 5-3.

One is, \\\"We want you to support this Constitution, so we'll say anything that we think will appeal to you,\\\" or the more straightforward, \\\"This is why we think what we've suggested in this Constitution is a good idea.\\\"         You clearly consider the former to be the primary situation.          Well, I know Hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist, and  probably the authoritarian extreme to Jefferson's democratic impules. But what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions on the government if we don't consider what they wrote about the government?         And is writing in support of something automatically \\\"propoganda\\\" to the point we must assume it is untrue or that they are saying what they don't believe?          If the Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords, than we'd almost have to state that the House of Representatives was also. (In fact, they both were, because the British government had much greater power than did the American system).                 I disagree.  The system is not too slow, it was simply designed to handle less than it has demanded that it handle.  As somebody in Washington put it (whose name I forget), \\\"Congress has become everybody's city council.\\\"         Congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than enough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy.         It is not a case of the system of government they created failing, but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically wanted to avoid.  Namely, a concentration of power.  It would seem then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either House in some attempt to grease the wheels.  All you'll get then is a system which moves quicker to do stupid things.  It would make more sense to make more decisions at a local level.          Please explain to me how Bush abused the veto in an \\\"extraordinary\\\" manner.          I fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were placed on the veto.  It could just as easily have been read as a means to put a check on democratically popular but unwise (in the executive's opinion) policies.           There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto power regarding what a bill is for.  Previous Presidents have used the veto for any number of reasons, most usually having something to do with their agenda.  I am really curious how you single Bush out as *the* President who abused vetos.          Why is it not a reasonable restriction?  Because 51 Senators is the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based?  If 41 Senators feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and  fillibuster isn't that *enough* to indicate there's a sufficient question as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re-evaluate it?         Why one earth *should* 51% be sufficient to enact a law which covers 250 million people in very, very diverse places and living in radically different conditions?  Why *shouldn't* a super-majority be required?         Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power to ignore the minority then the minority *will* be ignored.  I do not see this as a positive thing.

But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only \\\"real solution\\\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the \\\"internal nerves\\\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that \\\"force\\\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\",\"ri    I do agree with you, in a way.

However, on a more serious note, I do believe that we should take some money  away from the foriegn operations in South America and costly border  interdiction efforts.  (Don't think I'm going to say, \\\"spend it to educate  people\\\", because I know plenty of educated dopers).  Actually, spend it on   things like drug treatment programs.

However, legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be  bought like cigarettes is just plain silly.  Plus, I have never heard of a  recommended dosage for drugs like crack, ecstasy, chrystal meth and LSD.

Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?  2) Science cannot explain origins.  This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends on what origins we are talking about.  3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science.  Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \\\"higher truth\\\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \\\"higher\\\" or  \\\"lower\\\"; they are simply true.  More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the scope of discussion.  4) This is a false premise.  If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.  5) By the way, I enjoy science.  On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read. However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy, perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.  6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.  Let us not quibble; count this one as true.  7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]  Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification:  \\\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\\\"  -----  It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.\",\" The quality of autobahns is something of a myth.

One solution, due to Derek Ho: when the popup is popped up, we SetValue its location -- which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the previous popup. The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue first, and only using SetValue if the required location is different. The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the location of the popup, so that the SetValue really does change the location of the popup.

President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President  Clinton in a question and answer session with the press:  1:36 P.M. EDT       THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk. Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day standoff ensued.       The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably insane.       He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover, responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound.       This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully. The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender.       I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision.       Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy. Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued.       Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been dne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people.       I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances.       Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now.       Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, after 51 days, you decided --       Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with --       THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go first and then the other.       Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --       Q  Mr. President --       THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I can't do it at once.       Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?       THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.       I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials. There were no shots coming back from the government side.       I asked a number of questions.  The first question I asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons I was given were the following:       Number one, that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be needed in other parts of the country.       Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out.       Number three, that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with the passage of time.       And number four, that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions.       So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time. The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time.       The third question I asked was, has the military been consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance.       Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that today.       Q  Mr. President --       THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.       Q  Can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?       THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold.       There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday. I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control.       I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves.  (Applause.)       I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the children.       But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for that.  So that is where I think things stand.       Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really decide that way?       THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we should have known?  Is there some other question they should have asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have.       There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves.       Q  Mr. President, were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from February 28th until yesterday?       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all along the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go back -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good job of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of the other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the authorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward.       Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves. That's what they thought.       Q  Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks?       Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that?       THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do whatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully cooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country.\",\"  When I owned an SE, I replaced the fan with SE Silencer, available, I believe, from MacWarehouse or MacConnection.

But these were miracles of our parent's doing.  For a decade and more the pundits have told us - \\\"you've lost it!\\\"  The \\\"me\\\" generation is only living on the accomplishments of the past.       You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living history they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell of it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as General Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle - to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.       What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand dollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only of that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen. Schriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the best new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and Poseidon ballistic missiles.       Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing.  This event is proof.  To our technological parents: We've listened to your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit.  And we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus behind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest engineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your insight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated into today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.       You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - a single stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You advocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are all great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You convinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld its components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a prime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the generation before you - the generation that built transcontinental aviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a little and Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who started this program for the SDI.       Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't even start with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a little - even sold a little and made a little money - before they moved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or more before putting the first \\\"rubber on the road.\\\"  Max Hunter - you didn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going to take ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable aerospace transportation is real.       We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same team here today but a few years to show through the Strategic Defense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us - launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about a year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet Union.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored the importance of our work in bringing about a new international relationship.       But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the next generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.       We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three years a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space rapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And yes - we'll make a little money off it too!       Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of space will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries.  What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to counter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars!       To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to the final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't Saturn V's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital system - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the way.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket exhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the world again - we must do it one brick at a time.

And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.  For example, I recently was asking some children the question \\\"What temperature does water boil at?\\\"  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked if they knew what scale, and was told \\\"It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale. That's what all thermometers say.\\\"  Well, that's sincere, and may be true in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT an absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should nurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion easily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of  the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.   [example of head-covering in Church deleted]  This was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the writing, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere. The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having a LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I  see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.    Even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally. I've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse \\\"blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks\\\" literally.  The Bible was not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way.     I agree.  Very few.  And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be  able to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another. The presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since I know I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.  I can't prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience. I also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite. Therefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them.   I can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which God is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE absolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell. Who cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as  well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they live on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on  how I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that cafeteria for lunch?  No.    This attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true, wonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an inner reflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.  NOTE:  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That'd be silly.        There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.        Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.        Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,        and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.        Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few         adults respond to this treatment.

Our people will continue to fuel the torch  of the revolution with rivers of blood until the whole of the  occupied homeland is liberated...''  --- Yasser Arafat, AP, 3/12/79   So, Ahmed is right.  There was nothing about driving Jews into the sea, just a bit of \\\"ethnic cleansing,\\\" and a river of blood.   Is this an improvement?  Adam   Adam Shostack            adam@das.harvard.edu\",\" The documentary interviewed Koresh and current and ex-members.   The documentary disucussed Koresh's \\\"Christ\\\" status inside the cult,  cult brain-washing techniques, and unusual sex practices (the leader  gets any he wants, and tells others when they can or can't).  I will let  others decide if using religious authority to have sex with a minor is  technically child abuse or not.   All true.   Well, if a fire was deliberately set by members of the cult, then the  history and background of the cult is very relevant.  The history  and backgournd of the Jones cult was very important in understanding  what happened at Jonestown.  Not taking into account the history and background of Koresh's cult may  also help explain why the FBI and BATF so badly predicted the reponses  they would get from inside the compund nearly every step of the way in  this badly handled affair.   It is likely that there will be at least two investigations (JD and congress)  at this point.   Interesting and conflicting details are starting to come out.  I have  reverted back to wait mode to find out whether the fire was intentional  or accidental and how it started and why it spread so fast.   \",\"I'm getting a sad Mac icon on a black screen with the error code 0300FF.

If it is only used for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file encryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced standard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to easy-to-break inverters.  Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap. Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e-mail and files, let's focus on this.  One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.  Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal less threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no secure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a \\\"goat\\\" can eavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones.  -------  Reading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese security services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.  Most legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to have a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of depositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable escrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the week, and that system has worked pretty well.  From my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that need to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in return we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly skilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be checked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have to be, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries, while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.  ------  In discussing this, let's try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and noise of some previous threads. This is a substantive and technical issue, and personal remarks have no place in such a discussion. \",\" Never had any problem with mine...

Don't both halfs of the key have to come together (in some form) at the time the chip is constructed?  Or is it built like a fusable prom, with the chip being sent to the 1st escrow agency to program its 1/2 key, then the 2nd agency to program its 1/2 key (but who invents the safeguards that prevent the 2nd agency from reading the information already programmed by the 1st)?  This isn't intended to be a flame or anything, I am just really curious how to manufacture these things while still maintaining the key escrow security without simply saying \\\"trust the manufacturer, they won't look\\\".\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: From Israeli press.

Notice what I said about this book.  I called it \\\"Easy reading.\\\"  The reason I dropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical Simon's.  I don't know how many walking encyclopedia's I ran across in philosphy classes.  The problem isn't in knowing sooooo much more than your average lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it.  Schaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was writting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was to simple.  I've talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I've been in lectures with the man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof's from secular as well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories)  His answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back and caused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at different open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well, simplistic.  It certainly isn't grad level reading.  But we must get off our high horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most people would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to say about this secular scientist at another time.  Also, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent* inquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt base.    Look, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must add a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in keeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know its limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust it of all value!  THis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic.  It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian faith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we fly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic lesson of life:   \\\"More without limits is less;  less with limits is more.\\\"    Or as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o freedom.  Let's put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to absurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the difference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity's contention with rationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very little else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust go hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called to go on by itself without his understanding.  This is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the Christian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment and say, \\\"Father I do not understand you but I trust you.\\\"  Now don't read all your objections of me into that statement.  I wasn't saying I do not understand you at all, but I trust you anyway.\\\" It means that \\\"I do not understand You *in this situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway\\\"  Therefore I can trust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery unrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is a statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of Faith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is not a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know why, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all the difference.  Now, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted company with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit more difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith like the insistent \\\"whying\\\" of a 3 year old.  It isn't just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot know.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other leads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in coming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after coming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need to know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp that, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may count decisevely against what we are able to trust.    If, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust him in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian leaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which allows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be ambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to us, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity. And that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in practice.   \",\"Anyone familiar with this video card? What chipset does the winjet use - S3?

Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces, I'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from one screen.   I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (within driving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if you don't live near here. Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxes for the monitors, but I'm confident that my few months of full-time service in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and flip it in your direction.

The first clause is not a condition, it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS, MILITIA OR NOT, that the people have a right to keep and bear arms.  This is NOT a right granted by the Constitution, it is a right presumed to exist by default.  The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the government from removing that right by stating very clearly the government shall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right.  Remember the Constitution is a bunch of negative things - things the government CANNOT do.  All rights, etc not epxressly given to the government go to the states and the PEOPLE (the same people the other 9 Amendments in the Bill of Rights talk about).  Since I am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation, I am appending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself (and you, I suspect).  I am sure you will find his qualifications adequate. If that isn't enough I can send you the Senate Subcommitee to the Judiciary on the Constitution report on the same thing...  There are some things in there that Big Brother types, like Biden, etc must have really had to swallow hard to admit.  I think you will find that people that seriously study the Constitution and state what it means will say the same thing.  Those who come up with 'new improved meanings' are those who are trying to subvert the Constitution for a given agenda.  Like Clinton and his Clinton Cripple, Gun Control, People Control, and Control Control, and the whole nasty mess.  Please tell us how this person is in error, won't you?

NOTE:  Followups set to talk.politics.guns  --------- Begin included article -------     THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT           by J. Neil Schulman  If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan, right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call would be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call if you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?  That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr. Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of \\\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\\\"  A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's expertise.  Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at USC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for \\\"Editor and Publisher\\\", a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field.  He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's fifth book on usage, \\\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\\\" has been in continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.  That sounds like an expert to me.  After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent the following letter:  \\\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.  \\\"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further, since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under oath to support, if necessary.\\\"  My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment, then concluded:  \\\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment. While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\\\"  After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political subject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity):  [Copperud:] \\\"The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a clause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb 'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia.  \\\"In reply to your numbered questions:  [Schulman:] \\\"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringed'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed' null and void?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,' 'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200 years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \\\"Since a well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'  [Schulman:] \\\"As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second Amendment to the following sentence,  \\\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,  \\\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?; and  \\\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure.  \\\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation.\\\"  Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his cover letter: \\\"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach any conclusion.\\\"  So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.  As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.  And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely. American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms, guaranteed by the Constitution.  And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.  it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?  Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution of the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits  for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.   The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed  unsafe under federal air quality laws.        \\\"People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to  exacerbate that inflammation,\\\" said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental  Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  \\\"When people are on  the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over  the edge.\\\"       The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits  with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter  of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because  they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of  compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10  exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.        In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at  levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30  microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with  asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.        The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory  Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung  Association's medical section.        The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that  particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study  by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles  may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.   Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms  and bronchitis in children.        \\\"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\\\"  says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"But more and more research is showing that particles are  bad actors as well.\\\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate  air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.

Following 2 days of  presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel  weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement.    Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a  distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins;  (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential  for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical  excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and  extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4)  patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high  risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely;  (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for  melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education  and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality  from melanoma.

Within the program, there are four types  of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily  in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on  clinical research; \\\"comprehensive\\\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a  multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community  outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer  prevention and control research.    Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was  the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new  cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage  of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened  the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and  cancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew  progressively.    In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today,  there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria  for comprehensive status.    To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an  institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly  established in 1990, the eight criteria for \\\"comprehensiveness\\\" include the  requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in  several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong  program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings  into clinical practice.    Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly  beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also  referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting  the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass  strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials,  significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important  outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of  sources.    The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and  capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit  important new findings or address timely research questions.

These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers  engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators  and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications  from new discoveries in the laboratory.    Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and  clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently  incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their  overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today.    Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely  structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and  control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health  departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention  and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions  responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.   Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with  institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community  hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.    Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward  creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through  interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the  laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

The  decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to  test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of  Health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and   Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the  therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies  including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH  that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is  intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the   replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's  reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the  MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.   \\\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the  next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\\\" said Shalala.    Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine  Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had  convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested  simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of  multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two  years.  ==================================================================       HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  \\\"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV\\\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol.  114, No. 14, P. 18        AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was  approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome,  the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the  drug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that  although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk  of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit   disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of  the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the  drug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S.  researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials,  many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients  experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of   AIDS symptoms.

In the United States, I generally read the NYT, and occasionally, a mainstream Israeli newpaper.   What you may not be taking into account is that the JP is no longer representative of the mainstream in Israel.  It was purchased a few years ago and in the battle for control, most of the liberal and left-wing reporters walked out.  The new owner stated in the past, more than once, that the JP's task should be geared towards explaining and promoting Israel's position, more than attacking the gov't (Likud at the time).

EDT                     Q   For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike  Whitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh  International Airport and with me is the President of the United  States Bill Clinton.              And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.              THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.              Q   There are a lot of things we'd like to talk  about in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just  breaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been  kind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in  the trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard  that two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and  Officer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been  found not guilty.              It's a situation that's been building for over a  year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.   And I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see  the situation in Los Angeles in connection with your  administration and what you're trying to do.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the  American people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a  tribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the  efforts of the federal government in developing the case.              The law under which the officers were tried is a  complex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury  decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible  for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did  most of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked  Rodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some  blows, and another officer who was a rookie.              No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but  it appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They  acknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think  that the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But  I hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:   first of all, the importance of trying to bring this country  together and not violate the civil rights of any American;  secondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.                I think it's important to recognize that in the  poorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this  country, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're  even more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our  efforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police  officers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a  waiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some  other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to  violence and drugs.              And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to  me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic  revitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed  areas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles  who wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many  problems as we do.                And I laid out a very ambitious program in the  campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment  to bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary,  Ron Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies  for that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest  unemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the  country.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to  the new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several  other people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with  regard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.              Q   Let's talk about what brings you to the  Pittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a  lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.   You've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you  said earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break  that gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to  Allegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that  battle?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First  of all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported  me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in  economic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it  gives the country a very different budget for the next five years  than we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and,  at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and  health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.              But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the  short run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money  to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half;  to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also  to try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The  plan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the  Senate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a  bloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come  to a vote.              I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote  for the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican  leader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to  stay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases  the deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending  targets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for  this year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five  years.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the  economy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that  are holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for  billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind -- much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.              So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.   I've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I  think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work  right now to show that we're changing the direction of the  country.  And that's the purpose of the bill.              Q   Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or  his office lately?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk  regularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison  operation to the senators that we think are open to this -- Senator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords  from Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six  others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and  know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life  of the budget I presented.              You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've  got a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth  is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life  of the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we  have this program well below the spending targets that Congress  has already approved for this year.  And they've done this for  years, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans  voting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as  putting the American people back to work.                So I just hope that this doesn't become a political  issue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and  the need for jobs.              Q   I have some questions from people who supported  you, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.   It has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot  of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I  think some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the  White House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go  through.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And  they're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull  it off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew  it was going to be like this.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask  people, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving  very fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the  fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in  history, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we  are moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on  political reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole  wide range of things.                But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn  it around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions  which led to the victory I received from the people in November,  and we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making  real, real progress.                I would urge the people not to get discouraged.   We're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going  to happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing  things.              Q   Thank you very much.

The technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as I understand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.  Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule today.  But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain cellular calls and then ask a judge, \\\"Hey, can we have permission to listen to those tapes?\\\" can they?   Yes, that is a major concern, but I think that they think they can win just by having 99.5% of the USA use this system.  They don't even have to care about the cautious .5% that's left.  They don't catch the really smart crooks anyway.

Basically get the eci-freaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth.. You think this is crazy. Well in a way it is, but in a way it is reality.

Basically to make it so expensive to mine minerals in the US, unless you can by off the inspectors or tax collectors.. ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends  of mine, that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income of the mine, versus the adjusted income, also the state governments have there normal taxes. So by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, and other expenses you can owe more than what you made.

I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such \\\"storys\\\" about them. OK ? Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:    -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.          It has an hightech \\\"boiler\\\" but the rest is still verry verry           conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-          powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.          If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find          a chapter about the \\\"CARNOT-process\\\" which describes how to          get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason          for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an          temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one           side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water          again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the           energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to          let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \\\"cold\\\"          steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.          And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of          energy that carnot will give them.          The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !          The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,          because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in          AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent          radioactive pollution of the environment !              -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-          Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still          verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere          around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with          the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the          metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.          This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures          up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.      -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever          possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the          years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem          at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have          1.5 mRem.

I want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap once I start running out of allocatable cells, using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color.  Once I determine if a cell is read-only, I assume I can then just request an XAllocColor() with the exact same color specifications and it will  then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another application.  So far, the only way I've figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors, once my colormap is all full up.  It should error out if the cell is non-shareable. But life would be much easier if I could just detect the read-only/shareable stuff directly...

Atheists don't believe in any sort of afterlife.    I think it's safe to say that Hell was never intended metaphorical. Certainly  not the equivalent of ceasing to exist.

It is, of  course, nice to see that even christianity might evolve to fit the worldview   of modern age, but I fear the church will not accept it.

Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his own rules.\\\"  The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.  Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than 100 German secret police generals.  \\\"I also want to talk to you, quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly. I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish race.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been written and is never to be written.\\\"  [Emphasis mine--rje]  The German word Himmler uses that is translated as \\\"extermination\\\" is *Ausrottung*.  Wolfe said a more precise translation would be \\\"extirpation\\\" or \\\"tearing up by the roots.\\\"  In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism, \\\"Judenevakuierung\\\" or \\\"evacuation of the Jews.\\\"  But archives officials said \\\"extermination\\\" is the word he actually spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.  Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's \\\"final solution of the Jewish question,\\\" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.  The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum here on April 26.  The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of Himmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.   ---From p.A10 of Saturday's L.A.

There is a 150 ohm resistor between the two jacks, with a 1.5K from pin 5 to ground.  The signal pin #2 in the preamp is summed with the built in IR receiver.

I can't help but wonder what would happen if all violence against Israelis stopped.  Hopefully, violence against Arabs would stop at the same time.  If a state of non-violence could be  maintained, perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved, i.e., greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the \\\"territories\\\".    Of course, given the current leadership of Israel, your way may work also - but if that leadership changes, e.g., to someone with Ariel Sharon's mentality, then I would predict a considerable loss of life, i.e., no winners.  Secondly, regarding your comment about the U.S. troops responding to \\\"stiff resistance\\\" - the analogy is not quite valid.  The U.S. troops could get out of the neighborhood altogether.

I glow everytime Ronnie's out on the ice. In fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in person is that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probably be seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.  He said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad stressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have to learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took that advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived in Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn't and wouldn't play a lick of defense.  It's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought all of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has certainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking at this team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it wouldn't matter.  If I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would be 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.  (I'd love to put Francis first but I do think the only thing that could really damage the Pens right now would be to lose Barrasso.)\",\"   Come on!

I'd like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation consoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.  We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes, and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control circuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.  I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the cue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one problem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be a sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute, so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid cuetape!)  Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function. (A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film) This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second. What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit of some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!

The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government should grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of minorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and in addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the \\\"Turkish Minority\\\" in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify themselves as 'Turks'.

Because  we prevented Greece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European countries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal rights.\\\"  On Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are predestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical reasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign powers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by cooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was will to improve relations with Greece.  NEWSPOT, January 1993   MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.  Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.    Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine.    Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly magazine  \\\"ENA\\\"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek general election.    Bulev said in the interview: \\\"I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.\\\" Sideropoulos said  in the  article that \\\"Greece  should recognise Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the border, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC are falling.\\\"    The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court summons,  was   that  \\\"they  have   spread...intentionally  false information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the citizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the international interests of the country (Greece).\\\"    The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian.    In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000 in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.    Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian human rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live.    Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent, especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.    Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections are over.  Serdar Argic\",\"  Yeah.

So do you also oppose all ideologies?  I don't think your argument is an argument against religion at all, but just points out the weaknesses of human nature.   I would like a reference if you have got one, for this is news to me.   One must approach the Qur'an with intelligence.  Any thinking approach to the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals.  I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in the after-life)?  I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the part saying \\\"For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward\\\" says they have souls.    (If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then  I have no idea _what_ a soul is.)  As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to give all verses of the Qur'an equal priority.  That is because, according to Muslim belief, the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact, denying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in Islam.   Look, any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence and thought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the Quran's message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly answer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings it can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that since women can clearly be \\\"forgiven\\\" and \\\"rewarded\\\" they _must_ have souls (from the above verse).  Let's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach, rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations  fully consistent are more limited.  Let's try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try to twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but provides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.\",\"/*  This program doesn't detect edges with compass operators and a laplacian operator.

Perhaps you should examine in yourself why as such a good friend, you  are unwilling to accept this imortant part of your friends life?  Why  do you call into question his faith?  Your friend has changed, he has  found something that fills a need in his life.  You need to decide if  you are still his friend, whether you can accommodate his new life.   It sounds as if you are criticizing him for a fundamental belief in  the Bible, yet you are quick to reveal that your fundamental belief  that it is superstition.  Perhaps if he knew you at least took him  seriously, that you at least took an interest in the light he has found,  that you at least tried to understand what has become a special part of  his life, you could together decide to become fundamentalists, respect  each others differences and remain friends, or part ways.  Maybe even if  you stuck it out with him, you could help him to un-convert.  Of course,  if you go in with that attitude he will surely see through your intentions  and begin to resent you.  I happen to be a person very tolerant of fundamentalists, because I know that the idea of a simple black and white approach to life is appealing.

I didn't switch my beliefs, but for those at home who maybe need a friendly face to invite them somewhere, the Witnesses provide a wonderful service.  You may have been conditioned to believe that religion is unimportant and witnessing is obnoxious, but why?  Are you afraid you might be converted and become one of them, that you will be swept up in fundamentalism, that you will become a weirdo. Friendship's a two-way street.

I hear Vida> that pilots and steward/esses have a limit as to the maximum Vida> number of flying hours -- what are these limits?  What are the Vida> main problems associated with too many long-haul (over 4 hours) Vida> trips?  The crew rest requirements are to prevent undue fatigue.  The cockpit crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew limits for this reason.  Crew rest requirements address amount of time on duty plus rest time.  A tired crew is an accident-prone crew.  The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military aircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably pressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members DNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.  Flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear.  If you don't have big pressure changes, you may not know that you've got a problem.  But if you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an airliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem. Ears don't clear readily because of allergies, colds, infections, and anatomical problems.  The last won't change; the first three can. Medication (decongestants or antihistimines, usually) can help. Chewing gum, sucking hard candy (or a bottle for babies), yawning--these will help all four causes.  \",\"Hi,  xtici worked for my system.

You send a command to the port to read it, then you time how long     it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit.  This time     is proportional to the joystick position.  Obviously, since time     is used as a position, you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste      of time.

I would suggest asking a doctor about contacts. Mine said yes to contacts. I think the scars from RK would preclude contacts.   No. RK makes radial cuts around the circumference of the cornea, up to 8 I think, and these change the curvature of the cornea through stress chages. PRK vaporizes (burns) away a thin layer from the front of the cornea making the optical axis of the eye shorter. The laser doesn't cut in PRK, it vaporizes. In RK, the eye is cut into.

There is also worry that a VAT would be far too easy to increase incrementally.         (BTW, what is different between Canada's tax and most of Europe's that makes it \\\"visible?\\\")          This would require a constitutional amendment, and Congress enjoys raising taxes too much to restrict themselves like that. (Besides, with the 2/3 majority necessary to pull that off you'd  have a difficult time \\\"forcing\\\" anything like that.)          Primarily because it's a practical impossibility to \\\"freeze\\\" tax rates.         However, this is something that bothers me.  We're always talking about \\\"consumer confidence\\\" and \\\"consumer spending\\\" as gauges for the economy.

I glow everytime Ronnie's out on the ice. In fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in person is that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probably be seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.  He said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad stressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have to learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took that advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived in Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn't and wouldn't play a lick of defense.  It's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought all of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has certainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking at this team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it wouldn't matter.  If I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would be 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.  (I'd love to put Francis first but I do think the only thing that could really damage the Pens right now would be to lose Barrasso.)\",\"   Come on!  Most if not all Arabs are sympathetic to the Palestinian war  against Israel.  That is why the ADL monitors Arab organizations.  That is the same reason the US monitored communist organizations and Soviet nationals only a few years ago.     All of these groups have, in the past, associated with or been a part of anti- Israel activity or propoganda.  The ADL is simply monitoring them so that if anything comes up, they won't be caught by surprise.    No, that is why World Trade Center bombings don't happen in Israel (aside from the fact that there is no world trade center) and why people like Zein Isa ( Palestinian whose American group planned to bow up the Israeli Embassy and  \\\"kill many Jews.\\\") are caught.  As Mordechai Levy of the JDL said, Paranoid Jews live longer.    They probably do.\",\"Well, I just got my Centris 610 yesterday.  It took just over two  weeks from placing the order.  The dealer (Rutgers computer store)  appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order.  I ordered the one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet. He wanted to know if that would be \\\"alright with me\\\"!!!  They must be backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping them with!     Anyway, I'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.   Being nosy, I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the first time.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected (must have come loose in shipping).  No big deal, but I would have been pissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up!

So, she's married to Joseph.  She gets knocked up.  What do you think ol' Joe will do if he finds she's been getting around?  So Mary comes up with this ridiculous story about God making her pregnant.  Actually, it can't be all THAT ridiculous, considering the number of people that believe it.

I'd like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation consoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.  We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes, and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control circuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.  I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the cue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one problem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be a sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute, so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid cuetape!)  Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function. (A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film) This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second. What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit of some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!

NEWSPOT, January 1993   MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.  Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.    Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine.    Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly magazine  \\\"ENA\\\"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek general election.    Bulev said in the interview: \\\"I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.\\\" Sideropoulos said  in the  article that \\\"Greece  should recognise Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the border, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC are falling.\\\"    The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court summons,  was   that  \\\"they  have   spread...intentionally  false information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the citizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the international interests of the country (Greece).\\\"    The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian.    In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000 in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.    Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian human rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live.    Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent, especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.    Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who largely live in Western Thrace).

So do you also oppose all ideologies?  I don't think your argument is an argument against religion at all, but just points out the weaknesses of human nature.   I would like a reference if you have got one, for this is news to me.   One must approach the Qur'an with intelligence.  Any thinking approach to the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals.  I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in the after-life)?  I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the part saying \\\"For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward\\\" says they have souls.    (If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then  I have no idea _what_ a soul is.)  As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to give all verses of the Qur'an equal priority.  That is because, according to Muslim belief, the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact, denying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in Islam.   Look, any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence and thought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the Quran's message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly answer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings it can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that since women can clearly be \\\"forgiven\\\" and \\\"rewarded\\\" they _must_ have souls (from the above verse).  Let's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach, rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations  fully consistent are more limited.  Let's try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try to twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but provides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.\",\"/*  This program doesn't detect edges with compass operators and a laplacian operator.

I happen to be a person very tolerant of fundamentalists, because I know that the idea of a simple black and white approach to life is appealing. I don't happen to share the beliefs of fundamentalists, but I am not offended by their prosyletizing.  I had a few good conversations with some Witnesses who came to my door.  I didn't switch my beliefs, but for those at home who maybe need a friendly face to invite them somewhere, the Witnesses provide a wonderful service.  You may have been conditioned to believe that religion is unimportant and witnessing is obnoxious, but why?  Are you afraid you might be converted and become one of them, that you will be swept up in fundamentalism, that you will become a weirdo. Friendship's a two-way street.  You must respect your friend, ALL of him, including his beliefs, if you want the friendship to continue.\",\" I had this problem some time ago.  Some BIOSes do not automatically install  COM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which  write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call  fails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put  \\\"device=pf.sys\\\" in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat.  This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS  tables are updated. It works great. PF will also let you swap ports and  such also if that is of any value to you.\",\"  This is probably the best part of your post.

While it holds PARTICULAR interest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain from discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity has been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental hold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans.  This was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in slave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It wasn't enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your GOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be worshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are these icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in European countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical physical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool, His feet to that of brass?

I hear Vida> that pilots and steward/esses have a limit as to the maximum Vida> number of flying hours -- what are these limits?  What are the Vida> main problems associated with too many long-haul (over 4 hours) Vida> trips?  The crew rest requirements are to prevent undue fatigue.  The cockpit crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew limits for this reason.  Crew rest requirements address amount of time on duty plus rest time.  A tired crew is an accident-prone crew.  The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military aircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably pressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members DNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.  Flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear.  If you don't have big pressure changes, you may not know that you've got a problem.  But if you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an airliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem. Ears don't clear readily because of allergies, colds, infections, and anatomical problems.  The last won't change; the first three can. Medication (decongestants or antihistimines, usually) can help. Chewing gum, sucking hard candy (or a bottle for babies), yawning--these will help all four causes.  \",\"Hi,  xtici worked for my system.

A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U is derived deterministically from this serial number. That means that there are only one billion possible unit keys.     To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is    first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.    S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a    64-bit block R1:      R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .     Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and    N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]      R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .     R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The    first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The    rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2    are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow    agencies.  Hmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2 is an intentional way of assuring a \\\"fail safe\\\" for the government -- U is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not change they constitute effective \\\"master keys\\\" (along with F), the theft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities) completely obviates the security of the system. However, more interestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no matter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1 and U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space if it NOT to provide an additional back door?  I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on approximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on the back of a napkin.  Even if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is assuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the goal is an illusion of security.  If S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if they can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number pairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one understands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and, soon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via espionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well -- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but by the time we know it may be too late.     As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are    written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a    file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part    U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third    disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent    2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.    After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the    vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional    assurance that no information is left behind.  None of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of \\\"destroying the laptop\\\" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction. We all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turned off for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don't know is why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the first place other than to weaken the system. We don't know if the agents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their information -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make the bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing this in a \\\"vault\\\" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room with a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make high-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little for most of the rest of us.     The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the    room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,    and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to    the escrow agencies.  What would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and the NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always honest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because they have the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don't need to steal they keys as they effectively already have them.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\"Don't get fooled by exponents 2^80 (possible keys) is not in the same league with 10^80 (particles in the universe).  2^80 < 10^25.

On a typical UPS (well, on ours, anyway), there is NO switchover from AC to DC.  All the protected equipment is ALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual  condition of also having them on charge.  If the power fails, big deal -  the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but  there's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it  takes a while).  If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter, why not do it all the time?  Then there'd be no switchover to screw things up, and no having to sense the failure fast.  Just keep the DC on charge when the power is on, and it'll be there in zero time when you \\\"need\\\" it.\",\"I produced an error last week about CHORION:   I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from others, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do not feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in this example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research specifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not as tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am not competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns out that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \\\"Greek Lexicon\\\" renders each verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical order.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is far from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes things a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is indeed \\\"chorion.\\\"   Now I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:   \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Louw and Nida  \\\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\\\"  \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Grimm  \\\"Word study Concordance,\\\" Tynsdale  \\\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other    early Christian Writings,\\\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich  \\\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\\\" Perschbacher  In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:   A space, place, region, district, field, area, \\\"country place,\\\"   land, farm, estate, \\\"a bit of tillage\\\", and similar meanings.  Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about \\\"grave.\\\" As some of these  books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books  are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I  think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into \\\"contradictions\\\" to  be once again, as your friend said it, \\\"lacking in substance,\\\" and thus Archer  is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would  have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them to support Mr Archer's contentions).   By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of \\\"agros,\\\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word \\\"agros\\\" is defined as \\\"a field in the country.\\\" Chorion is specifically noted as a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly Bullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for \\\"field\\\" in Matthew (ie: agros) is different from the word for \\\"field\\\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and thus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already admit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity which drives the point home).   So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise (eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this  particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer questions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and  the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in discussing the \\\"Potter's Field.\\\"       Later,      Dave Butler\",\"  The big-bang model supposes a temporal singularity at the point of origin. There was _no_ time for a prior cause to occur in. If you want to invent fables for the surrounding context, fine, but one fable is only as good as any other.

Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield, now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime, he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't  know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field, he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important) was a absolute-primo-dick.    Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.    Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks  (Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been  a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.    You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers, simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you  blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one,  the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should  HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.  Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.    Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?    Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a  good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early 80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer :-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.  Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real stiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory, and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as SS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.    Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a \\\"mediot\\\"  candidate, pushed because of his \\\"winning attitude\\\" (a minor factor, if one at all), and his \\\"great defense\\\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.  SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris' \\\"ability to win\\\" which is nothing more than Morris' \\\"ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\\\".  At this point, Morris is an average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned  close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but not favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF \\\"consideration\\\".    Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about \\\"Yount and Smith being shortstops who  hung around a long time\\\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's  just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre... (Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)  Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY  tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the league.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.   This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it  or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.  I won't consider ANYONE who started playing after about 1985 (again, too early to tell.) [Note: these are all active players, I'm not counting recent retirees]  Baltimore:  Cal Ripken (should be a lock by now, even if Gehrig's record stands) Boston: Roger Clemens (might be a lock already, which is amazing), Dawson (?) Detroit: Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker (possibilities) Milwaukee: Robin Yount (discussed earlier) New York: Wade Boggs (possibly), Mattingly (long shot) Toronto: Paul Molitor and Jack Morris (possibilities)  Kansas City: George Brett (lock) Minnesota: Kirby (too early to tell), Winfield (lock) Oakland: Eckersley (lock), McGwire (too early), Rickey (lock), Welch (LONG shot) Texas: The Mighty Nolan [Too early to consider Canseco or Strange :-)]  Cubs: Sandberg (lock) St. Louis: Ozzie (lock), Lee Smith (probably) New York: Murray (almost a lock), Saberhagen (obviously, he's got to regain              past form) [And most certainly, NOT Vince Coleman, despite what he'll tell you :-)]  Los Angeles: Butler, Strawberry, and Hershiser are all long shots. San Diego: Tony Gwynn (pretty good shot) Colorado: Dale Murphy (a good shot), Ryan Bowen (just to see if you're awake)   [Before I get flames: this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list, there's probably a few deserving candidates that I left off, and, I didn't include Barry Bonds, Will Clark, Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher, Frank Thomas, Canseco, McGriff, etc. because I only considered guys who started playing before 1985)]   E-mail or post, I almost fear what I may have started here... \",\" ------------ Part 8 of 14 ------------ MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AYZ>8=#0T\\\"L!A%(!*]#0T\\\"4E)<-N;@+(U,C(;CZ;1-/3

There is a way.  Certainly it is not by human reason.  Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase Sartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing.  Your logic comes to fruition in relativism.    Ah, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in contemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus ('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of language he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary framework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but a threshold.   vonWrights's comment that Witt's \\\"sentences have a content that often lies deep beneath the surface of language.\\\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing ourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with Witt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes in our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it is already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man.  Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.    This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in it conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of understanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \\\"as a man thinketh, so he is.\\\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside, that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals of truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that there is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too are knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the individual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to Christianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the Spirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has the capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not only has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep things of GOd that are absolute and true.    There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced and it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.    \\\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would say unto me.\\\"  Job 23ff  --Rex\",\" Warren Brown, the Washington Post's auto writer was the first journalist to get his hands on the New Yorker.

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the  low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and  would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's  another curve approaching)  3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is  depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern  electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.  this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about  to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as  little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.  also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a 5 speed)?    how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear, low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight. \",\"I am looking for Super 8mm Projector with SOUNDS.

Whether that player is in Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him to be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.  Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian players.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners can do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable here in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US that the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.  Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would make players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in North America?

(ie. the Jets do have a few Russian players in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.)) So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players in North America.   I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the world.

I first heard about it in this newsgroup  several years ago, and I have just got hold of a book, \\\"How to improve your sight - simple daily drills in relaxation\\\", by Margaret D. Corbett,  ('Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953.  It  talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there been any study on whether this method actually works?  If it works, is it by  actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing  the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the  too-long eyeball?  Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the most logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process, i.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there been any recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works by  changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of  eyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the  eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates's  idea, right?)\",\"OK, here's something for all of those people who think cops are always more responsible then the rest of the population.

She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she  believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.   (Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the  food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!

But not all of them did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.  Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include: psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most -- maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of these.  There's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try different things, some of which seem to help.  Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days.

The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre are in 'Milliyet' today.  69 year old Hatin Nine telling:  -''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''  72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:  - ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.   Turks, you must die.''  28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:  - ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of     my eyes.''  Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming? Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?  The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British Journalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.  Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these \\\"lies.\\\" They are saying \\\"exaggeration.\\\" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's 3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...  The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.  Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.  Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''  The age we are living in is termed a human rights age.

Then the masses have the same rights as the individuals, because everything comes down to the individual in one instance or another.  To draw an analogy, Norway is involved in the EEC.  The USA in involved in NATO.  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws.  NATO requires no such changes in USA law.  These laws affect citizens, and hence Norway is saying Europe is more important than, say, Norwegians having motorcycles that make over 100bhp.  In the USA, we'd likely tell the EEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business, in our eyes, in telling us how much horsepower we can safely ride.  While I note that our own state governments often play with game with the federal government, in essence this is a cultural difference between us.    It shouldn't.  Since neither of our countries has managed to remove criminals from society, in America we feel (and remember we have individual states that are larger than your country) that if the police cannot protect us then we must do so ourselves.

The explanation    we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult    members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit    of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,    you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule    is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is    incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.  2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were    outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When    questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault    was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were    thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew    you could!  3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,    hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and    referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm    more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not    related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up    some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's    now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by    the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I    was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI    agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say    uncomplimentary.  4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that    the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the    reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing    this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references    to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around    the \\\"He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\\\"    flag.  Sigh.  5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege    reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought    processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button    because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My    only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to    the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to    an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in    the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the    forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In    that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones    Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:    Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and    other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the    BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have    been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it    was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's    paranoid delusions.     --   #include <std_disclaimer.h>\",\"After reading reports from Germany of success in accelerating a Quadra or Centris simply by changing the clock oscillator, I decided to test the claim.

If I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each (1 for motherboard, 1 for each of the 2 disks), would it work?  Is the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk?

This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know  that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans  are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls  say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times  published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war;  42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent  if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to  sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not  very enthusiastic?  Thank you.              Q   I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going  to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the  answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.              THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is,  it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example,  the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will  obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be  good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will  be used to support the privatization of existing public  enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the  Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have  some influence over the distribution of.                With regard to your second question, let me say that  I would think that there would be people in both countries who  would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government  giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to  that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history  there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That  is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole  history of America, any kind of aid program has always been  unpopular.                What I have tried to tell the American people is, is  this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that  this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion -- trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments  because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in  Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them  working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies  going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it  possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the  economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and  investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce  nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on  our side and on the Russian side.                So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an  investment for the United States.  This is very much in the  interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the  second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next  week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for  the taxpayers and workers of my country.                Russia is a very great nation that needs some  partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share  her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view  this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not  what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful  investment.                Like all investments, there is some risk.  But  there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than  the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier  of the Cold War.              Q   Mr. President, first of all thank you very  much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory  of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American  President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind  of a very measured breakthrough.                I have two questions.  One, in your introductory  remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief  that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you  tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to  what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification  of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how  confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager  to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions  inherited from the Cold War?                PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of  Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with  regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent  states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States  develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing  that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of  the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude  our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that  would provide not only an important economic opportunity for  Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out  on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed  off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and  we agreed to continue to press that.              I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to  reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the  Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the  United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine,  but that, in order to do what we need to do together to  strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States  be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join  the NPT regime is critical.              What was the second question?                THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and  COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the  Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will,  as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other  restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on  relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies  of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of  them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the  leadership of the Congress.              With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be  an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there  are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to  emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there  is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed  to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be  much less.              With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing  more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my  own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement  out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to  begin it in the fairly near future.              Q   Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in  Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely  different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not  political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of  Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the  difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the  difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of  Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the  last part of your speech?              THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to  compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say  what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a  boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the  music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been  thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music  for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists  and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know  as much as I could about your history.                And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then  the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last  presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone  in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr.  Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I  was following events there very closely and hoping for the day  when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a  personal feeling about Russia.                I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like  music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a  musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York  Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony  to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly  than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically  so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it  occurred.                These are things that have always had a big impact  on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever  had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two  countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)

The logic and actual rationale (as opposed to the excuses that get fed to the media) is the same in both cases, only the items or technology in question are different.  I think this is no accident.  It comes from the same philosophy that the government rules/controls the people, not the people controlling the government, that the unconnected citizens are not sophisticated enough to know what is best for them, so the government must tell the people what they need or do not need ... \\\"we know best...\\\".

I would guess that a tiny fraction of 1% of the folks reading your post agree with it. I kind of doubt that even you agree with it.  I'm not going to go through your points one at a time, because,  after all, not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball.  I'm only replying to this because you brought up Pam Postema, the AAA umpire who sued (is suing?) baseball on the grounds of sex discrimination because she wasn't promoted to the majors.   I've never seen her ump a game. I have no first hand experience with her ability as an umpire.  But I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems to me that she is missing the point and if that's how she sees the role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn't promote her either.  The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners safe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is to maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the players from trying to kill each other.   Umpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most of us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of the rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well. Umpires need to command the game; command of the rulebook is secondary.   \",\" box, manual, phonecord    $25 + shipping Dennis \",\"   Wrong.

Generally, these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, for example, we have the following set regarding children:   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to   the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum   [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem   families and received as servants when they are left alone through   the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect   all such children in your province and send them to the places of   deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to   the people.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [1]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the   time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their   lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.      Minister of the Interior,       Talaat\\\" [2]   \\\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.    November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the   orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their   places of exile.        Abdullahad Nuri. [3]    \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been   opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is   done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt   of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or   any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it   purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as   detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received   into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish   special orphanages for them.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat.\\\" [4]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.     Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures   to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with   the caravans.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [5]   \\\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.    At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows   of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is   not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by   Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble   in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned   out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of   deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent   away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [6]  In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \\\"rationalizing\\\" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:   \\\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for   its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks   it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I   shall die for it.\\\" [7]   These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these \\\"death march orders\\\" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.  For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.  If one were to examine the sample \\\"authentic text\\\" provided in the Turkish  Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it  too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the  Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or  Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery.   Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide  architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a  heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.  This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian.     - - - references - - -  [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60  [2] ibid, page 60  [3] ibid, page 60  [4] ibid, page 61  [5] ibid, page 61  [6] ibid, page 62  [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and     London), 1926, page 387  \",\"this is a test   \",\"The Quadra 700 goes thru extensive initalize routines of its hardware, read's PRAM, obtains all info from last session including the volume setting, and then executes the sound procedure for the startup sound, and wait's on the SCSI controller to respond to the boot up code.

Do you find the exegisis convincing or not?)\\\"   MY REPLY...

But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you have produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dug deeper.  I'm glad you have begun in this post.  I will begin Greek studies on these passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well.   DB... \\\"It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as evidence.  Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it often enough:     But are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  Let's see, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other passages, we see that he has also used (b).  On the other hand he has presented no use of:   (d) historical context                or (e) historical content                or (f) other pertinent historical info   or (g) cultural context                  or (h) cultural content                  or (i) other pertinent cultural info     or (j) grammatical construction          or even (k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger don't count]   Thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.\\\"   MY REPLY... Question:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on starting to use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present shallow observations (I don't mean this in a bad way). At this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a total exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re: Judas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use several of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also. It will greatly enhance our study of these passages.   DB... \\\"The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other passage.  Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list is red herring and his only real criteria seems to be:     MY REPLY... The reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that the PASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one another. (1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention; (2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look at your defense of this later.   Also, the \\\"reward of iniquity\\\" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at stating why you believe it is).   At this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.   DB... \\\"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so that both could be considered correct.\\\"   MY REPLY... One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these passages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's explanation of Judas' death...   _____________________________________________________________________   HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \\\"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\\\" =============================================================   This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are constantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error. Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is destroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at all. Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and was crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do they necessarily contradict each other? Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that Judas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be true and supplementary. A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall. Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself. This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at the same time. On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping form the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the case of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a situation of different perspectives of the same event.   _____________________________________________________________________   Your only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit inerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely. Here's what you said in an earlier post...   _____________________________________________________________________ DB [quoting Tony Rose]...   \\\"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so opposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.  But you seem to find Tony Rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David Joslin's.\\\"   _____________________________________________________________________   Here, you discredit Tony's explanation based on what you deem too \\\"heavy\\\" for the passages.  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can say it's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it didn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.   Questions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or are either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an alleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe in this respect.   DB... \\\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:     Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer it because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\\\"   MY REPLY... I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a local hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.   To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is \\\"begging the question\\\", if I may quote you.   [Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian Research Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these terms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]   DB... \\\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\\\"   MY REPLY... Qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention below. Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we have re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's synonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But he lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can discover.   DB... \\\"Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects Christian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.\\\"   MY REPLY... Thank you, Dave.   DB... \\\"Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted the hanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^   MY REPLY... [^^^ above, mine] So it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony's position.  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?   Also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or deceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done with Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including their \\\"interpretation\\\" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.   You also noted they \\\"interpreted\\\" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although that is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember, that's the first criteria we must examine.

[^^^ above, mine] No you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly probable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.   The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New Testament.   In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus), it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \\\"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his father's tomb.\\\"             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \\\"hanged himself\\\" [Gr. Sept., APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \\\"and died\\\".  Here we have no doubt of the result. In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.   Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply means \\\"hang oneself\\\".   DB... \\\"But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable                                                                      ^^^^^^^^^ Christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful.\\\"   MY REPLY... [^^^above, mine] \\\"Reputable\\\"?  You mean ones that have never erred? As far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done, even by me. ^^^^^^^^^   As I said in an earlier post...   _____________________________________________________________________ Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria), I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.   MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \\\"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\\\" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of hanging. All it says is that he \\\"went and hanged himself.\\\" Luke however, in Acts, tells us that \\\"and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\\\" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the other details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle, etc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Matthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable, but not clear ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut. ^^^ _____________________________________________________________________   I also wrote...   _____________________________________________________________________ MY REPLY...   Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed. Let's look at the passage in Matthew:   MAT 27:4 saying, \\\"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.\\\" And they said, \\\"What is that to us? You see to it!\\\"   MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.   MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \\\"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\\\"   MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.   MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   Notice verse 5...\\\"Then he...went and hanged himself.\\\" Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a result of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ What does Acts say? ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.   ACT 1:20 \\\"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'   Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the \\\"two\\\" accounts of Judas' death is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ say Judas \\\"hanged himself\\\", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the hanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no contradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.   .......   MY REPLY... ...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records his death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be the case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ______________________________________________________________________   I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however, highly probable.                            ^^^^^^   DB... \\\"By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as the correct version in both Matt and Acts.  \\\"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\\\" suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly exploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).\\\"   MY REPLY... The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted post gave us some...   _____________________________________________________________________ A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom.

Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the source of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is correct: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from).\\\"   MY REPLY... Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss this with you.   DB... As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically mention \\\"the reward of iniquity\\\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \\\"...concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\\\").  Now I would point out that when the Bible describes an act of \\\"iniquity,\\\" and then immediately discusses \\\"*the* reward of iniquity,\\\" it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\\\"   MY REPLY... Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!   ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, ACT 1:16 \\\"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus; ACT 1:17 \\\"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\\\" ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.) ACT 1:20 \\\"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'   Notice that in verse 16, the word \\\"iniquity\\\" is not used.  Rather, it states that Judas \\\"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\\\". But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \\\"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\\\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?          ^^^^^^ JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it. JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had said to him, \\\"Buy those things we need for the feast,\\\" or that he should give something to the poor.   So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se. Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer, according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of \\\"wages of iniquity\\\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen by Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the \\\"wages of iniquity\\\" are.  What do you think, Dave?   DB... \\\"Now since I have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of asking me what type I think you are, as you did to Mr Joslin).\\\"   MY REPLY...

Frank\",\"I've been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers, notesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night at the Stick.  After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was  very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).  It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.  The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb. McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball. So on & so forth.  I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.

In the five month period between the two seizures, my daughter had eaten a fair amount of Kix and Berry Berry Kix in the mornings and never had a problem.  I checked the labels and the first ingredient is corn.  She has also never had a problem eating corn or corn on the cob but of course, that is usually later in the day with a full stomach so the absorption would not be so high.  I do believe that Frost Flakes have corn in them but I will have to check the Fruit Loops.  But the fact that she has eaten this other corny cereal in the morning makes me wonder.

Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be nice to hear some good news once in a while.  After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a request for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50 in his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded more than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day.  Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a message from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed the money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and assured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He sent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a transfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him to fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times to get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for my signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the deal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world's best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good ones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat you may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my software from him.

Previously, when I first start up my PC I can see all the  CMOS messages (RAM test ...etc) but now I've got to wait  for about 3min before the display shows anything and it starts up with a bright white flash.

Thanks in advance,\",\"All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or Monophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really sola scriptura.  Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by the Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so.  Andy Byler  [You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based on Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus' teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship occuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more time.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are right, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.  Accepting the principle of \\\"sola scriptura\\\" does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite clear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is on where the Bible would have us place the line.  By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters that are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free to determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that the Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or (since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to decide.\",\"My old jacket is about to bite the dust so I'm in the market for a new riding jacket.  I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would like to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.  I'm considering two basic options:  1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs     due to recent price increases, but I'd imagine over $400.     That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact     that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates     the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.  2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new      Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey     unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather     are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose     value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper     than upper Aerostich.  Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other  layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out  lining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows,  shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a  reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would  be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.

For example, incorrect English constructs such as \\\"its raining\\\" or \\\"it's window id\\\" annoy me. However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!).  On a related topic, who is to say that \\\"color\\\" is more or less correct than \\\"colour\\\" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API terms such as \\\"XAllocColor\\\" and \\\"colormap\\\".  In a world that uses the term \\\"Windows\\\" to refer to Microsoft Windows, perhaps the time has come to accept \\\"X Windows\\\" as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say, \\\"the X Window System\\\" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it. Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short, snappy, descriptive title (\\\"X\\\" is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called \\\"Microsoft Windows\\\" or \\\"the Microsoft Window System\\\" or how about just plain \\\"Microsoft\\\"!  To summarise (or should that be \\\"summarize\\\") the point of this message: I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be \\\"windowing system\\\"). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System. \",\" [Stuff deleted]     Will, there has been a lot of discussion going on about this over in s.r.c.b-s. I will make the case here though and try to help you out:  8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9).  Yes, it is by God's grace and our faith that we are saved.  We are not saved by what we do.  However,  15 If ye love me, keep my commandments. (John 14:15).  Keeping Christ's commandments is a \\\"work\\\" per se, and a demonstration of our love for him.  Also,  6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. 7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? 8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: 9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. (Luke 13:6-9).  Again,  16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. (John 15:16).  It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit.  What is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being love, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest in the actions that we carry out.  If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things Christ commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith.  Asking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your pants is more important.  Good works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith, true faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs commands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit, then we shall be uprooted just like the tree.   It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for days about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a building and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you all day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really don't have that faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the test.  Words and talk mean nothing.  I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but this should be sufficient.  Hope it helped.

ST JOHN'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS The St John's Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by problems. On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but off ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the leafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of the seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \\\"home\\\" games in places like Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \\\"home\\\" games will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One demostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus and rocked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium. Despite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs will return to St John's once the strike ends. =================================================== SENATORS SOLD The New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to the Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian NHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear they intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic Provinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL head office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting in May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it  clear the league was more interested in the stability of the  AHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining the 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven.   The Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown New Brunswick and are expected to move there. ================================================== DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON After announcing that they would pull their affiliation out of Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind.   The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they wanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.  Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining 6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks in the New Brunswick city.  The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if the season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold 1400 for this year. ============================================================ SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL The Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of Saint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200 Exhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion frnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble. ========================================================= CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE Despite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore Skipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks, announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates. There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced a limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players including 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited farm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders. ====================================================== AHL GAME OF THE WEEK In early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced by, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian Maritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of the week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there has been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and shown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic Sports Network in Canada (but I'm not sure about that). I am not sure if playoff games will be covered. ===================================================== UTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?

What I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either: \\\"All war   is wrong\\\", or \\\"Some war is justifiable\\\".   To get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the   question. In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New   Zealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of   it, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).   Through this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved   in the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation   hardware as the very best a 'real' flyer could ask for. My favourite   computer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both   past and present.   I became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all   military activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition   to God's commandments to love one another, especially one's enemies.  During the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to   the reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation   technology I so admire - The F117A 'Stealh' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16   strike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy   simulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam's   bio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his   Mig's in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful   game. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.   One only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact   of war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a   pilot is simply a 'target'. Dead civilians are 'collateral damage'. These   euphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose   support are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to   look at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.  Now we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and   the prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in   the former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of   Sarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry 'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,   has caused me to rethink where I stand on 'justifiable' war.  I will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say   - Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut   reactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality   history brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for   my reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I   am working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.  1. The Second World War  - Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.  - Massive civilian casualties on both sides    - Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki  - Probably justifiable.  2. Korean war  - Political expansionism by North Korea, basically    communism vs. capitalism.  - Probably not justifiable.  3. Vietnam  - As above, worsened by US involvement.  4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.  - Genocide by Khmer Rouge.  - Probably justifiable.  5. Iraq (Desert Storm)  - Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply  - Other factors such as genocide.  - Not sure, but probably justifiable  6. A future involvement in Bosnia  - Genocide - so called 'Ethnic Cleansing'  - Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.  - Probably justifiable  7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,   somewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya   or Israel.  - My feelings in this are simple  - Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent  - I love the New Zealand government's stand on banning all nuclear    armed or powered warships from NZ port.  - Never justifiable.  These are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused. I   would appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture. I   *don't* want a - Naaahh, yer wrong - I think answers 8-).  Thanks for your help.  ==========================================================================                                     | Alastair Thomson,                   | Phone +64-3-479-8347 Chief Programmer,                   | Fax   +64-3-479-8529 The Black Albatross Porject,        | University of Otago,                | Department of Computer Science,     | e-mail alastair@farli.otago.ac.nz P.O.

Am I missing something?\",\"    Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions. However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the center.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can always hide a sufficiently small number of a different type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming that there is only one population of GRBs).  The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.  If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy) you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of the Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center (for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.   The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.   There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature. Right now, the theorists have a sort of unofficial moratorium on new models until new observational evidence comes in. \",\"Quoting jgfoot@minerva.cis.yale.edu in article <1r3jgbINN35i@eli.CS.YALE.EDU>: \",\"Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part10 Last-modified: 1993/4/15   FAQ for sci.crypt, part 10: References  This is the tenth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ.

FACT SHEET                    PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT  The President has approved a directive on \\\"Public Encryption Management.\\\"  The directive provides for the following:  Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology.  Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of communications and data by preventing unauthorized access.  Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications.  These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the information age.  Despite its benefits, new communications technology can also frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated encryption can have this effect in the United States.  When exported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence activities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law enforcement and national security interests, while at the same time protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As encryption technology improves, doing so will require new, innovative approaches.  In the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.  To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect and decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted information, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:  INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS  The Attorney General of the United States, or her representative, shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which incorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed key-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from the American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow microcircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications hardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the security of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the government from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.  KEY-ESCROW  The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate entities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits installed in communications equipment.  In each case, the key holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent unauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only to government agencies that have established their authority to acquire the content of those communications that have been encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such communications.  PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES  The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate U.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted with key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems that process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of a final standard within six months of this directive. \",\"No, no, we aren't talking about receptors for the brain's sensory  innervation, but structures such as the thalamus that handle pain for the entire organism.

Your fascist government got away with  the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying  the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away  with the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in  Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem  districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed and hundreds of civilians also perished.     Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included     the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,    Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives,     children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians     joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan     districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of    3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished    to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to    the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and    seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell    into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims    themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels    also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the    large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from    occupying the city.     The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out    the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the    neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They    raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours'    distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.     At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,    Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible    atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in    the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the    neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.     Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the    Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four    villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,    they continued to spread death and destruction among the    Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down    their arms.

I'll try to get better.  Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far, only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.  Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K.  vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.   I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of excuses.    I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.  From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I  see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see the dialog:   Me:  \\\"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\\\"   BK:  \\\"There is no truck.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around at look.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at      the oncoming truck.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around or you will run over.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\\\"  Me:  \\\"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing       to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\\\"       I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.  BK:  \\\"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.       Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\\\"       And by the way, I really have an open mind.\\\"   So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?     I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have. I can now see the truck behind Brian.  My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment, Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture.

If the gift of tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone, no matter what languages they know, there would be no need for the gift of interpretation, and I Corinthians 14 would not have had to have been written.     That's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million Christians world wide.  Sure, there are some who want glory for themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those who do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthian church also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.

A1.  NEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE   * INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage    by a man who infiltrated political groups  By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.  SAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-time art dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In reality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40 years.  His code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office.  For a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White Aryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he obtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people.  And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government to trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills.  These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former Los Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with police and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League.  Officials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improper activity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They have refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz.  Transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents released by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory.  At times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air with laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like \\\"Ironsides\\\" and \\\"Flipper.\\\"  On one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a pro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa, Israel.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties to Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him.  Shortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed him.  The court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIA agent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League.  Gerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its contents included passports, driver's licenses and identification cards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for four American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank birth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies.  Also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a black hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of blindfolded and chained men.  Investigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the ADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one target group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.  Each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant.  The Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil rights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL's fact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists.   However, evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept files on at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the United Farm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center for Investigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, the Asian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP.  The computer files also included information on several members of Congress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey from the Bay Area.  In their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation League has collected information on political activists in the Los Angeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely with three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized in intelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism expert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligence officer.  A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation, and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declined comment.  Bullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as a volunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party.  Bullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by the ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In the mid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the West Coast.  To keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never missed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said.  \\\"I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all anti-democratic movements,\\\" Bullock said.  \\\". . . Officially, I'm only a contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would not be officially connected with me.\\\"  Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists to Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own name but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink.  \\\"I'm one of a kind,\\\" he told police.  In recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly become known, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him.  In the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police.  In part because of this investigation, he became close friends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Francisco police intelligence division.  Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An FBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group:  \\\"Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and would share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to Gerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to Bullock.\\\"  From a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876 individuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose files contained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people.  In 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the South African government.  Bullock tells of meetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100 bills.  Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published by San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African Bishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli -- and submitted it as his own work.  Bullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence.  Bullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African government evenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, \\\"I may be gay but I'm a straight arrow.\\\"  In his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law.  For example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records and criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said Gerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence files on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy.  Bullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation of Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League's San Francisco office.  Bullock seemed proud of his \\\"Operation Eavesdrop,\\\" in which he used a paid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White Aryan Resistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by members of the right-wing group.  \\\"For a short time, it was wonderful,\\\" he told police.  In Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a \\\"fact-finder\\\" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups.  Among other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los Angeles ADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had \\\"anti-Israel leanings\\\" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment.  Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate group.  Gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the probe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation.  Unlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation.  Gurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed by The Times. Bullock's attorney said his client would not comment.\",\" I'm just guessing here, but I'd guess that X11R5 expects the CG3 to have 1152x900 resolution, and the version of the CG3 in the SPARCclassic is  1024x768.  -- \",\"...

In the meantime everyone he mentions has died and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established. Moreover, Pauls account of some of the events in Acts (as recorded in  Galatians) fail to establish the acts accounts.

Those are two separate questions.  Obviously, Israeli authorities do recognize Israeli nationality for some purposes, e.g. passports, consular services, etc...  ID cards have a field of nationality which is a subdivision of the above.  Ostensibly, this field is provided for sevices provided by the religious departments of the gov't, though this is not the general case.   From its onset, Israel's borders have been shaped and reshaped by both war and peace.  As such, the Israeli gov't has always felt that defining its borders is a step that is meaningful only after peace treaties have been conluded with its neighbors.  There is no plan for \\\"ultimate borders\\\" (is this a game like \\\"ultimate frisbee\\\"?) extending into  other countries.   Aside from what Vaanunu provided, no.   If that is true, then by virtue of the question's subject, it is unanswerable.  Anyone who claims its validity. is claiming an oxymoron. That having been said, I deny the above.  You go on to ask quite a number of questions that show an obvious bias.  Questions of the sort \\\"Is it true that you entered your mother's vagina?\\\" which are based upon some kernel of truth, though phrased in a way as to render them repugnant and cast aspersions upon Israel.

I've  transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois. ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.  The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king, who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which  the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million, His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual, seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of slots.  The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions supporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from  70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside). According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and  the Pacific Rim.   RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money. Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began  negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in  Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time. Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way that people operate.  For example \\\"everybody can sell you everything.\\\"   Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.  Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who  went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually, he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the  Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to  allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.  The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied  Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in  Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners :-)  Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is  apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them  specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their  satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They  have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place now.  Tidbits:  *  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big business because big business is just like what they have over there, except that \\\"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\\\"  *  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months.  *  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia, and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.  *  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith.  Italy gets a new government \\\"every two weeks\\\" but we don't worry  because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.  *  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting 25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \\\"equivalent\\\" value in  rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government.  *  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western  satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites, which was rather reassuring.  *  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much  shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the  difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition, shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date hardware. \",\" Is it right???

Being brought up in a Christian household, I often wondered if there was God the Father, where was the mother? Everyone I know who has a father usually as a mother. It just seemed rather unbalanced to me.   Fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not fall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both a masculine and feminine force. It provides a sense of balance I find sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which I think is responsible for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat each other.\",\"*FOR SALE*  Compudyne 386-25SXL Laptop 80 meg HD 4 meg RAM 3.5\\\" FD VGA Monochrome 64 Grey Scale  +Math Coprocessor!

Since they aren't fixed in position on their stainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different position. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of contact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the ball, not the center cylindrical area.  I've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but needs to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our office's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one could still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might help.  I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If you can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl  alcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.  If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see if it is actually causing the axle to spin.   If all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-( It could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be necessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that dirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction.

Let's do it right this time!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:  [1] microgravity/vacuum process research [2] life sciences research (adaptation to space) [3] spacecraft maintenence   The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to centralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet their targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users  took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to  tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization and miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial  users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the  constellation.    Firstly, different functions are broken down into different  constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function: thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits, comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation, providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.  SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments and are also prime candidates for constellization.  [1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now: COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for short-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is inexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities  on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET. We might also expand the research program to take advantage of  interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt  or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a  station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.  [2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity, but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter of LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since astronauts will have little practical use in the space program until costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation, and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars, Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR interface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown, follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface, testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billions are spent on astronauts.  [3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in  Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck solar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs, inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.  By applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we have radically improved the capability of the program while greatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag, we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study life's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety  of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose orbits.  N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration as well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.   Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously  we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and sample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology greenhouses on Mars at low cost.  \",\" While that is currently true from their perspective, it is also worthwhile to note that in such cases the populace often does suffer from attempts to control the guerillas.

As I recall, Amal was primarily nationalistically \\\"Lebanon for the Lebanese\\\" motivated.  I think that the difference between them was also a matter of funding and support.

No peace talks.  N.  No Israel  if we assume that Lebanon and Syria are sincere in their desire for peace, why hasn't the Hizbollah been disarmed?   Bearing in mind the above and that military losses are more palatable than civilian ones, I am sure you can understand why Israel is slow to act in that manner.   I agree that Syria wants Lebanon to be part of its greater Syria. I don't necessarily see that the Syrians would be unhappy to see Israel up to its neck in another Lebanese morass afterwhich Syria could continue on its merry schedule when Israeli public opinion would lead to a second pullout.   <*sigh*>  Why can't some gov'ts negotiate as easily as some people? \",\"Could we plase cease this discussion.

I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, just have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and   muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent  irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep,  wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the  spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot, and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 \\\" apart.)  This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.

Surely you don't wish for the Democrats to destroy our beloved country just so your party can get some trivial political advantage? That's rather a petty way to think. (Not that this pettiness doesn't extend all the way to the U.S. Senate, I've noticed...)  While Bush was president, I kept hoping and praying that he'd wise up. I couldn't stand the man, but I wish he'd done a decent job; if so, we might not be in the mess we are now, and that would be a small price to pay for suffering through another term of Republican control. Similarily, YOU should be hoping and praying that Clinton does a good job. Even if you're certain he won't.\",\"wing the suggestion of Stu Lynne, I have posted the Image File Format executable and source code to alt.sources.\",\"  Take a second look at \\\"non-toxic, non-flammable\\\":    MACE (sold tothe public) is supposedly nontoxic.   Whatthey do not tell you is that if you get mace directly   on the linings of the lungs (such as a direct snort to   the face) above certain quantities, it reacts similarly   to a mustard gas inhalation.     I know:  my father and grandfather were exposed    to poison gas in WWI and WWII; Dad went through    the side effects of any WEAPON, including those    \\\"non-toxic\\\" aerosols.    WHat the label ACTUALLY means is ::     usually, it wont kill you    it may give you permanent CSS asthsma    but that's better than blowing a hole in your     head ...    ALL aerosols are flammable IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OXYGEN   AND HIT IT WITH THE RIGHT IGNITER.  SOme of the most   non-flammable substances known will BOOM or SEARFLAME   if you hit it with the right combo.     Let's take one:  a trash can fire.  Makes black smoke;   already burned right?  Can't go boom, right?  Wrong.    Suck that smoke (made up of paper that has carbonized,   or burned about 35% of the fuel in it) into an air   conditioning return, mix with about 5:1 air, and light   a match.  200 feet of conduit is about the same, when   filled with that smoke mixture, as oh, say 200 pounds TNT     THAT is why the fire codes say NO OPEN CEILING    TILES IN BUILDINGS.  Because 3-5 stories of    a building have blown OUT by \\\"nonflammable _smoke_\\\"   So:   Take a little \\\"nonflammable aerosol\\\"   Mix with gasoline or kerosene fumes     NO electricity, remeber?  A bit of heating    on the WACO plains?  Boil water to drink    since the water was cut off?    liberally mix and allow to settle for 1-4 hours    Fumes vent down into the bus underground, and the Davidians   move the children UPSTAIRS to a saferoom (they had one,   armor plated, remember?) to BREATH, because kids get sick   and die from tear gas.    and along comes a tracer, a spark, what have you:     everyone burns to death.  Try thinking before opening mouth: it may not have happened the way the Gmen say it did.\",\"I once read an article on  Computer technology  which stated that  every new computer technology was actually lower and slower then what it replaced.  Silicon was less  effective then the germanium  products then available.   GaAs  was less capable then Silicon.  Multi-processors were slower then  existent single processors.  What the argument was, though was that these new technologies promised either theoretically future higher performance  or lower cost or higher densities.  I think that the DC-1  may g=fit into this same model.  ELV's can certainly launch more weight  then  a SSRT,  but  an SSRT offers the prospect of  greater cycle times and  lower costs.  This is kind of a speculative posting,  but I thought i'd throw it out as a hjistorical framework  for those interested in the project.\",\"Here are the standings after the April 6 update.

These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and Oberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a spot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence, the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the four sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of the crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional to the position of the spot on the detector's face.  Let's try some ASCII graphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)                  -------------------------> 1              |                       |              |                       |       |\\\\            -----   cathode 1         |       |  \\\\            XXXXX                     ________| +  \\\\            XXXXX|                            |      \\\\        -------     light >XXXXX|                            |        \\\\_____ divider __ output            XXXXX|     |                      |        /      -------            XXXXX|-----| |--                  |      /           |            XXXXX|   + |    |         ________| -  /           1 + 2            XXXXX|         --- gnd    |       |  /            XXXXX|         \\\\ /        |       |/            XXXXX| anode              |            XXXXX                     |            ----- cathode 2           |              |                       |              |                       |              --------------------------> 2  If the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position of the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina- tion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).  When this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light, then the way of \\\"tuning\\\" to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal, light the LED for an equal time and sample that signal separately.  The difference between the two is the position of the LED.  Hamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2-D lateral photoeffect detectors, and they also sell the required signal processing electronics.  The ready-made systems by SELSPOT and others are NOT cheap ...   Lindholm, L.E., and K.E.

If you are  considering buying one or the other, definitely go for the DX with a nice  size external cache!  The performance is far greater.  The DX2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50MHz, while the DX  has a potentially much larger cache to work at 50MHz with.  Neither  systems could actually run a program out of main memory, since DRAM is  still too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns = 16.66MHz < 50MHz ).  -rdd  ---  . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were performed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter antenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis is in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.  3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network) advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone 70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees to 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.  5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance measurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC measurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and currently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 184 hours   TRAJECTORY       As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:   Distance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU)  Distance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU)  Heliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour  Distance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km  Round Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds   SPECIAL TOPIC\",\"Can someone please remind me who said a well known quotation?

If it has two positions, its an AR-15, if    it has three, its an M-16.  There are numerous internal differences    as well, but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see    them, they are not valid in this discussion.  So, in conclusion,    there is very little external differences to distinguish an AR-15    from an M-16 except at close (very close) range.

Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence \\\"ESC [ 1 B 7\\\"  would indicate that the \\\"HOME\\\" key was pressed, with the shift key down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such as \\\"shift-Return\\\".  If anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code in the source file \\\"x11term.c\\\".  Maybe if someone at OSF is  interested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about  emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods  somewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.  Notes:    * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create    its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which     includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.   * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2    [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].

He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has  36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain throughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and Mark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than MVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.  Biggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season as a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+ points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming from the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew Cassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23 and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put up about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing,  although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the right side.  Biggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77 point season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started the season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate, since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it). Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded the powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his way out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left to run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the  Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar after signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of competence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better hockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got to make a number of starts in a row.\",\"    >>>Does the greatly increased rates of incarceration amongst     >>>blacks show that they are dysfunctional or that the majority     >>>of them support criminal activity?     >>>     >Isn't this a matter of demographics?

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration rate for violent crimes.  So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism present.  There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.  Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt blacks.  In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).  Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.  Blacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences, except in the South, where they receive around 20% less on paper!!    --  There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of environmental disaster.

Used printers are fine, non-apple printers are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:  Required features:  - PostScript  - 300 dpi  - emough memory to download fonts  - The cheaper, the better.  I'd prefer under $1000.

I'm a laser bigot and the first to admit it. :)   I'll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I'm writing.  The page will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and maybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn't need to be spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.   Printers I've been looking at:   - used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that   only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?  - Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).

I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz. The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.    The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used at these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design of this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).    While using this would have let me reduce the \\\"external\\\" IF count on receive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I didn't bother with it.    The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2 MHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios actually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and speed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data stream is another matter entirely.    Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a \\\"beacon\\\" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO also shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even though the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes of the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of a second.    I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the proceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running low on resources of time, money and energy.    If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW ID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma Mtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally polarized.    I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and you might want to carefully consider your \\\"target\\\".  If you can't arrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think you'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by multipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS. For more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread spectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems. I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.  73 Glenn Elmore n6gn\",\"  I am fairly sure that she could obtain citizenship by making an application for it.

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed    to Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their    plan !     (Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity    since it was coined by Bnai Brith)     What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media,    is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic    Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in    Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.     However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their    homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political    thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the    Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.     As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.     Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true    super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the    Jews used to establish their state : Religion.      Ahmed.  Forget the syntax, Ahmed, and focus on the semnatics. The fact is that the PLO does not recognize Israel's right to exist. This is perfectly obvious from the PLO covenant (Cairo, 1968). The covenant calls for the destruction of the \\\"Zionist entity\\\". As far as I know the Israel-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies the purpose for the existence of the PLO. If you would like, I can post the relevant caluses.  Now the Hamas ideal is far more radical, it seems. I know it has been posted here several times, and while I do not have a copy of it, I am sure that someone does and he (or she, of course) would be more than happy to repost it.  Regardless of phrasing, groups like Hamas, and the Hezbollah, and even the newly moderate and politically-correct PLO, have at the very heart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel.  It just seems to me that Mr. Davidsson's suggestion that Jews support people envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealing one to many Jews.\",\"The Centaur is controlled technology..

I've been doing it my self over 200,000 miles, on my current toyota truck I've got over 150k. I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission. My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use?  On some old pieces of junk I drove, the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless. To date I've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy. Some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker & easier they where to shift.  My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window, I lightly press the accelerator & try agian. I've found that clutchless shifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000). I also skip gears some times using 1-3-5 ,1-2-4-5. \",\"  A brain abscess is an infection deep in the brain substance.

For example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book \\\"Sinus Survival\\\", always gives, before any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his new patients IF they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times in the last two years.  He's kept a record of the results, and for over  2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief of allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his program.  In my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorly  written book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which I never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage of Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm also *greatly* improved in other areas as well.  Of course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to molds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a natural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various sorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus since that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000 question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was from over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there's no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.  BTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll find a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.  In summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', I cannot guarantee their safety.

What do you mean fair?  God is just, giving to everyone what they deserve. As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf Romans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole of the human race except Mary, have sinned.  Which is why Jesus said, \\\"Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless he is born of water and Spirit\\\" which is the true meaning of born again (John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.

I would describe myself as an agnostic, in so far as I'm sure there is no single, universal supreme being, but if there is one and it is just, we will surely be judged on whether we lived good lives, striving to achieve that goodness that is within the power of each of us.  Now, the complication is that one of my best friends has become very fundamentalist.  That would normally be a non-issue with me, but he feels it is his responsibility to proselytize me (which I guess it is, according to his faith).  This is a great strain to our friendship.  I would have no problem if the subject didn't come up, but when it does, the discussion quickly begins to offend both of us: he is offended because I call into question his bedrock beliefs; I am offended by what I feel is a subscription to superstition, rationalized by such circular arguments as 'the Bible is God's word because He tells us in the Bible that it is so.'  So my question is, how can I convince him that this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preserve what is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a great friendship?

Ha Ha. :|  \",\"[insert deletion of unnecessary quote]   First of all, God does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing people.  He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19).  However, if he enjoyed punishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus to \\\"seek and save that which was lost\\\" (Luke 19:10)?  You asked for it.  2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished. Matthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in God's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity. 2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the disciples \\\"will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord\\\". 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth being condemned. Revelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes and those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in the \\\"fiery lake of burning sulfur\\\". Revelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast \\\"will be tormented with burning sulfur\\\" and there being \\\"no rest day or night\\\" for them because of it. Psalm 9:17:  \\\"The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that forget God.\\\"  I think those should be sufficient to prove the point.   Joe Fisher  [In the following I'm mostly playing \\\"devil's advocate\\\".  I'm not advocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that it's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible to see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often uses the term \\\"second death\\\".  The most obvious understanding of that would seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks both of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms that can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince you of one view or the other, but to help people understand that there's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to understand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire, whatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35 implies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably they just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to  understand this passage in a non-literal way.)  2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them in hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.  Matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is eternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever. Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been prepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the eternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet will be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being thrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \\\"the second death\\\". This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as the devil, and humans?  2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \\\"everlasting destruction\\\"? This is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be understood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in eternity.  2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction. Revelation 21:6-8: see comment above Revelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there, it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says that the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that  there is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people are tormented forever.

This three part message consists of E[M; K], K encrypted with some other key, and the chip serial number.  This three part message is then encrypted by still another key.

The speech waveform is sampled and digitized and then some number of samples are grouped into a 64 bit block. This block is then encrypted and transmitted over a non-secure communications link.

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master.    In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives  when performing diagnostics.    There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way  interface connector. They have the following functions and are described  in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper  described nearest the 40 way interface connector.  LK2: LED       When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the      interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An      external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with      the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will      be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130      Ohms ot 220 Ohms.  LK1: Dual Drives      This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single      bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,      indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.  LK4: Master      When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If      there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be      jumpered in this way.  LK5: IOChRdy      When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is       fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher      data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per      second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally       fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per      second.     There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s) may be jumpered:       Master, single drive with LED on interface  LK2 & LK4 fitted.      Master, single drive without LED on interface LK4 only fitted.      Master, dual drive without LED on interface LK4 & LK1 fitted.      Slave, dual drive without LED on interface  No jumpers fitted.      Master, dual drive with LED on interface  LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.      Slave, dual drive with LED on interface  LK2 only fitted.     The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.     The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way  connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the  drive for this LED driver.

I will surely answer!\",\"or there   Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.  The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was because of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by scanning this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines).  When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \\\"I want to play a mono sound\\\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted the documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound.  Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from the IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.  Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware, and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase works. On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra 700/900/950 at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel only. Both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification, but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.  If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their games will only come out the left on some games.  The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related. It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what machine you have.  Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list: and also Hellcats, Super Tetris Oxyd (and many more, these are just what I've tested)  Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.   Other games you list: and also PGA Tour Golf Civilization (and more, these are again only from personal experience)  Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.  The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT! Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to do, but I'm going say it anyway. Stop cheating on sound! Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period is about to end. The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will work even better soon, so use it.  In conclusion: To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug. To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all hardware.   Have fun.  Disclaimer number 1: I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed. So don't write me with sound questions.  Disclaimer number 2: If it says up above that I wrote anything like \\\"the grace period is about to end\\\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.  Disclaimer number 3: I don't speak for Apple, just me.\",\"  I originally wrote to the person who asked this question personally, but decided to post the information I had on the topic.   I spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently,  by coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that  while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the  Church as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church  recoginizes itself as a community of believers, members of the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable to each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island, there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without the priest being present, but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area.     I remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus, married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the community.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with one another--the community should be able to rely on that  couple to be as one.   While couples may marry without witnesses, they  may NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An  anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage at all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half-hour later!!   I tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage, but I would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they intended to be married, assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a commitment, I believe, in God's eyes.   But I'm digressing....     God be with you,\",\"    We're looking at a series of chips by WSI, the PSD3xx series. They have _mega_ address decoding logic on them, various ROM sizes (upto 1Mbit), various RAM sizes (upto 16 K), and 19 I/O ports which can be chip select lines, I/O or the buffered address lines.  Cute chip, 44 pin PLCC package.  Second sourcing may be a problem though :-( \",\"The subject says what I would like to do, here are the details:  I have a 512ke with the MacRescue upgrade board that makes it the equivalent of a Plus (System 7 and MacEnvy both identify it as such).  The MacRescue board clips onto the 68000 on the MB.  It also has a 68000 itself.  Periodically I have to remove the clip (not an entirely easy thing to do) and clean the \\\"legs\\\" of the 68000. Larry Pina's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with snap on upgrades:  the 68000's \\\"legs\\\" will oxidize, causing  unusual system errors.  Well, that's me.  So, I would like to do something permanent, and I think it would be fairly easy to put a socket in where the 68000 currently is, and modify the MacRescue board to plug in.  What I'm not 100% sure of is whether it will work.  It seems to me that the two 68000s aren't acting independently; so removing one shouldn't have any effect on the performance of my Mac.  I'm about 97% sure.  Will someone provide the extra 3%?\",\"It would be nice to think that individuals can somehow 'beat the system' and like a space explorer, boldly go where no man has gone before and return with a prize cure. Unfortunately, too often the prize is limited and the efficacy of the 'cure' questionable when applied to all sufferers.  This applies to both medical researchers and non-medical individuals. Just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use does not make the next cure-all. What about the dozens of individuals who have courageously participated in clinical trials? Did they have any guarentee of cures? Are they any less because they didn't trumpet their story all over the world?  As a parting note, wasn't there some studies done on Gingko seeds for Meniere's? (To the original poster : what about trying for a trial of that? It's probably not a final answer but it certainly may alleviate some of the discomfort. And you'd be helping answer the question for future sufferers.)\",\"I need help binding some value to the HOME and END keys on my keyboard.

Thanks.  \",\"Kevin Mitchell's sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated  pitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over  New York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started  with a solid single to right, moved to second on \\\"Bob\\\" Kelly's infield sneaker down the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a  rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.  Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only  given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double by Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after Joe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who  argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by \\\"drawing the line\\\" (really, he should know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting tossed.  The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must  have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's single, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell and turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson failed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:  Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly: Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended. (Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)  The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's ground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back singles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long fly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was hung out to dry killing the Reds rally.  Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game in late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended up walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a  week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went to Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings work, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit surprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.  The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory today.  The Mets are 6-5.

I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target, then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to harm.  But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away, heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this moment is hazy.  I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not. So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!  Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.  What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?  I eagerly await comment.

Allan, I know the circumstances of several of your falls. On the ride when you fell while I was next behind you, you made an error of judgement by riding too fast when you knew the road was damp, and you reacted badly when you were surprised by an oncoming car.  That crash was due to factors that were subject to your control.

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:     I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the    net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in    schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside    the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?    Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as    provided for in canon law.  Here's some of the theology involved for the interested.  There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's \\\"schism\\\"; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:  - true obedience - false obedience - disobedience - schism  Take the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes:  1) a command 2) the response made to the command  As far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be ILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god Dagon when every other full moon comes around.  As far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do what is commanded, or to COMPLY.  Making a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:  command         response            name ----------------------------------------------------- LEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience ILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience LEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience ILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience  So now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.  Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of the commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to consider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are \\\"obedient\\\" or \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad.  In my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god Dagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!  As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.  And there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been commanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of course disagreed.  So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the traditional teaching of the Church is.  The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of American Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You will never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press in this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I get -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X.)  Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some soundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually some Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand, there is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the Popes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, if the situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very least, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this badly.  Schism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?  Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate command).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, so it doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are schismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with the Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.  So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.  You must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any decent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find: the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command.  Here's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:      ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this     character it must include besides the trangression of the commands     of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.     (from the CE article \\\"Schism\\\")  Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear no: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every day.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.  What all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position is a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and schism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone who finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)  Now, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the Holy Father's motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", you can find out.  It's the definitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically Papal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter that the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Pope himself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.  In this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:  1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre constituted a schismatic act.  2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of Tradtion.  Both are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.  As far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting article in a translation of the Italian magazine \\\"Si Si No No\\\".  It all gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they would truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is this: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power of Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the Pope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite well, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.  The \\\"Si Si No No\\\" article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel, post-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea, episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article to a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.  The Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me. There's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic theology.  So why does the Pope think this?  As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's the passage in question:      The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete     and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does     not take sufficiently into the account the living character of     Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,          comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the         help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into         the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes         about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and         study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.         It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which         they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who         have received, along with their right of succession in the         espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.      But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which     opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the     Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to     remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond     with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ     himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.      (Papal motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", 2 July 1988)  It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following:  - Vatican Council II has happened. - I am the Pope.  The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that Archbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them. This is weak, to say the least!  It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed Archbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II's stand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius IX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to ignore what all these Popes said on the subject?  I don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the SSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.  --------------------------------------------------------------  [Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey \\\"justified disobedience\\\" or even \\\"obeying God rather than man\\\". Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in Wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.  Similarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope says that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it exists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break, that there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will shortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?  It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in the process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his powers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is all in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally it has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope. While they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated. This would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command that you say defines schism.\",\"  First of all, I resent your assumption that you know why I am threatened by science, or even that I am threatened at all, although I admit the latter.  The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence-- God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree, Science.   My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations, for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone. Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have  children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that is made possible.   People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death, and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world.   This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely  prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary  alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,   go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us?   I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not, but I will say this:  Before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body they have been given, they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to  believe their search is displeasing to God.\",\"   The newspaper itself is almost certainly copyrighted in its entirety.

This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason to believe it still goes on.  Read this:  From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992  PUBLICATION BAN          The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many         years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were         sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of         their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever         being made public.  By Baruch Me'iri  All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: \\\"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published\\\".  The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.  In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy.  In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about \\\"the third man\\\" being in prison.  But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries.  But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.  The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:  \\\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner\\\", asserts MK Zucker.  On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \\\"There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public.  \\\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\\\"  Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  \\\"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret\\\", wrote Zucker.  The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, \\\"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter\\\".  \\\"The Union is aware\\\", says Shiffman, \\\"of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.  \\\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy...\\\"  Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible.  \\\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it.\\\"  -- Do you find this situation acceptable?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment.\\\"  -- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the discretion of the court?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse.\\\"  -- And what if there really is a security issue?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.  Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public.\\\"  Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \\\"A healthy situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security\\\".  A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir.  \\\"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.  \\\"Nevertheless\\\", adds Shtendal, \\\"the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\\"  Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \\\"As a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances.\\\"\",\"I'm looking for a PC that is small and doesn't break apart if you drop it on the groud.

Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris 610, which ONLY comes with a non-FPU 68LC040 processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU - the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot swap one for another (again, according to Apple's memo).

I was wondering: although a DX-50 is faster because of the path to it's external cache, shouldn't the choice be the DX2-50 as that one can be made to work properly with a local-bus? I mean, cache speed is one thing, but all your speed will be blocked during video I/O, so just get that faster...

As I said, you appear to be the only person saying that all morality is relative.  Most people I know do hold some absolutes in their moral system.  I >>personally<< believe that the dignity of the individual and the right of free will are absolutes.  I recognize that there are some moral systems around which don't accept this; I reject them as dangerous and anti-social (nazism, some forms of communism, fundamentalist xtianity--no, that's not a slam).

I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in \\\"contraceptive technology\\\" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.    Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't we teach \\\"safe drug use\\\" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it because we know that a class in \\\"how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs\\\" would increase drug use?  Why isn't \\\"drug abstinence education\\\" barred from schools because it teaches \\\"religion\\\"?  Aren't we abandoning those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe use?  \",\"   Well...I need the old 8\\\" disks ...

Until even 1976 not even one word of this executive order chartering the NSA was sealed.  Paranoia, right?  On the outside of the NSA complex is a ten foot Cyclone fence with multiple rows of barbed wire, with high voltage, complete with signs prohibiting even making sketches under penalty of the Internal Security Act.

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.   The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password   and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full   descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli   [BER91].    decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.    There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,   Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will   decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox   files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you   think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a   call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files   that have a 10 char or less pw key.''  * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?    A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the   plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.   If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the   following:     1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.   (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of   the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.    If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something   over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different   key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes   of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which   indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.    2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This   removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since   English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of   text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing   plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact   one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)    If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a   standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis   texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in   the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.   See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].  * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]    Here's one popular method, using the des command:      cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail    Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called   PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through   1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.   There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this   writing.    There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting   mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own   newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ   as well.    PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm   without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)   in the USA.    RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which   is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside   the USA.    Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of   the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the   message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there   have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and   algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as   we know).  * Is the UNIX crypt command secure?    No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt   breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks   on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].  * How do I use compression with encryption?    A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by   some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).    Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact   distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's   impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse   characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up   more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy   has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some   redundancy in your compressed output.    Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they   have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that   actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of   UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''   that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.      This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a   bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means   removes the need for strong encryption.    Compression after encryption is silly.  * Is there an unbreakable cipher?    Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the   one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as   plaintext.    Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be   useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by   likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is   expected to remain valid.  * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?    Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom   number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be   cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to   predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of   the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of   0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.    A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function   of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently   random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by   the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps   generated by a hardware random number source).    Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,   generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of   entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,   cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo    gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in   it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,   for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random   string.    When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is   important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that   because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \\\"random\\\".  For   example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be   unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a   clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.  * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?    See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount   of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in   the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number   of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this   can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to   back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.    Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have   multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security   from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.    Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic   measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives   probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext   for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible   plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys   are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally   deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine   the likelihood of events of interest.    Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than   D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not   enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of   possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,   which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to   8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but   the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work   required to find the key after approximately D characters have been   intercepted.    In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used   in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key   size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if   it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few   practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all   manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack   some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic   considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a   recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.   Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and   information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most   promising directions.    Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information   statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal   1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the   possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].  * What is key management and why is it important?    One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in   full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,   and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of   course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling   Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)   Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can   eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in   modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are   transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but   also enough key material to cover the traffic.    Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and   handling of keys.    A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology   is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use   employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key   Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that   certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control   personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and   to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the   reporting of lost CIKs.    This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management   problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,   many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''  * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?    Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from   relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a   linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random   number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds   and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a   high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically   this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for   cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more   complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---   but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable   structure at all.    See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].  * What is the correct frequency list for English letters?    There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than   the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:   namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of   English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,   but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.    The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do   you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a   fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It   has changed over time; it is different between different authors.   Any particular message will have different statistics from those of   the language as a whole.    The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have   exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all   reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.   In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other   buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood   estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a   text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with   reasonably robust answers.    So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will   be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.  * What is the Enigma?    ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of   information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by   the British during WWII.''    See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].  * How do I shuffle cards?    Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of   values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output   permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you   need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly   distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that   function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH   is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two   addresses given)    for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;    modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since   ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the   error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s   modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less   than y, go back and get another ranno() value.   * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?    Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with   possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted   separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps   even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.    As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard   PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the   keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be   encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in   part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one   of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.    If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must   be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in   the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.   The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the   illegal copy.   * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?

They can be guaranteed to give the government line when it counts. In US history it has been the  socialists such as myself who have been persecuted.    Now before people start asserting that there is no mechanism by which the administration can get their new chip adopted without legal force lets try thinking.  In the first place the clipper chip must have existed for several years as a defense project. Therefore this is not a party matter at all. George Bush was in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls, he was chief spook  remember.  Secondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure. They simply \\\"ask\\\" their chums who they give huge defense contracts to (motorola etc) to be \\\"nice\\\" boys. After all Bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly since the chips won't be avaliable to foreign firms.  Thirdly the people who consider the Democrats to be socialist are not the same as the ones who consider socialists to be communist.

Sometimes.....  Depends on WHY it misfired....   I can't imagine doing much combat type shooting single action.....   Assuming the cylinder WILL rotate....   Never hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you've got one of those 'new fangled' hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties, it's unnecessarily redundant.  I'd rather have the extra round.   Quite true.  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around than magazines though.   True, but this is a training function.   Cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions are the only carry modes that make sense...  The 80 series Colt's for example are quite safe to carry this way.   Agreed.  Now that I've shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It is true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  On the other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the years.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high primers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem. An auto?  Jack the slide and continue.  I've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from turning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen with a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.  Most revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sorts of close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto take a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely to malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight. The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall into that category.  Vincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing view of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's \\\"The Semi Auto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\\\"  In general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi auto effectively as a self defense arm.  Most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department isn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their own.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several times that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother.  For myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pick what fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that day and so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!  That said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of buying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a Ruger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.

If every pitcher in baseball were essentially the same in quality (i.e. if the variance of pitching ability were much smaller than the variance of batting ability), then scoring runs would be much more important than preventing them, simply because the *ability* to actively prevent runs would be much weaker.   If that's your point, you should have said so.  What you in fact said was \\\"Pitching and defense win championships\\\", and later \\\"Pitching is the essence of baseball\\\".  Neither of which says what you are now claiming was \\\"your  point\\\", and neither of which is true.   And you accuse Sherri of mouthing cliches!?   It's not clear to me at all that this is true.  In high-scoring games, the team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time.  In low- scoring games, the split is essentially 50/50 regardless of team ability.

The Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Isles beat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.   However, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in general that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders  back-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that  the Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period, come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable how many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty  wide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played  a golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL  debut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this  guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a  Mahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot  correctly.  Has anyone else noticed this?   Also, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick Vukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey talent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the puck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties.  Richard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he's a defenseman.  He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus.  This guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \\\"enforcers\\\"?  Not only do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are really trying to play the game.  I'll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a  good fight once in a while, but only when it's \\\"called for\\\".  You know, when a guy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \\\"hockey ethics\\\" might cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are losing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already.  I'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the referee doesn't call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy, not physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost.  If you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place.  Just My Honest Opinion,\",\" Then not murdering would have no moral significance, since there would be nothing voluntary about it.   You are starting to get the point.   Mimicry is not necessarily the  same as the action being imitated.   A Parrot saying \\\"Pretty Polly\\\"  isn't necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of Polly.   See above.   They do.   I and other posters have given you many examples of exactly this, but you seem to have a very short memory.   I'm saying:   \\\"There must be the possibility that the organism - it's not   just people we are talking about - can consider alternatives.\\\"  It's right there in the posting you are replying to.\",\"Darryl Strawberry's moon shots were fun!  He can hit those high and far home runs that if he actually ran them out he'd be rounding second base by the time they landed.  We used to say that he should have to file a flight plan at LaGuardia for some of them.  Then _Bull_Durham_ came out and that was changed.  :-)  On homers he pulled that didn't go high, they were microwave home runs. Microwave, as in they got outta there in a hurry!  In a game in 1988, he came off the bench with the flu and on the second pitch send a rocket down the right field line that didn't even allow Bob Murphy the \\\"luxury\\\" of a home run call.  The story went he stayed in the clubhouse, the with the Mets down by two and two on Davey Johnson sent for him to pinch hit. He came out of the clubhouse saying \\\"one swing and we go home.\\\"  He hit the homer, ran the bases, then went straight for the clubhouse to shower and go home.  Those were the days....\",\" Version 2.03 drivers are current.\",\" The answer to both questions is yes.  All Scripture is true, being inspired by God.  The evidence for this claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group.  Similarly, all truth is absolute.  Indeed, a non-absolute truth is a  contradiction in terms.  When is something absolute?  When it is always true.  Obviously, if a \\\"truth\\\" is not always \\\"true\\\" then we have a contradiction in terms.    Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a statement is terribly self-contradictory.  Let me put it to you this way.  If there are no absolutes, shouldn't we conclude that the statement, \\\"There are no absolutes\\\" is not absolutely true?  Obviously, we have a contradiction here.  This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming that there are indeed absolutes in the universe.   So?  People sometimes disagree about what is true.  This does not negate the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  Moreover, evangelical Christianity, at least, still professes to believe in certain truths.  Man is sinful, man needs salvation, and Jesus is the propitiation for mankind's sins, to name a few.  Any group that does not profess to believe these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical.  \",\" Fine.  Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable with the use of state sponsored coercion.  The notion that coercion can be virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious  consideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.    For example, does \\\"non-initiated force\\\" (coercion) include tax collection? Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned by Adam Smith?  Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the state, how is the state to deal with it?  Exclusively through after the fact arbitration/legal compulsion?     Well, I must admit that the picture of libertarians as Amway participants is somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a  complex, conflictual, industrial society.  I'd venture to point out,  however, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group  of \\\"seminar participants\\\" to \\\"embrace\\\" their philosophy, their  propaganda skills need to be honed.    Frankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a  society in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper government policy.  Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalities can be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  And as Mr. Marx said, the state will just wither away.    On the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating  virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the  current society will help us to live happier lives? Or is it like socialism; just some short-term pain that we'll have to bear until  everyone has had the benefit of \\\"re-education\\\" through regular  \\\"seminar\\\" training?  jsh \",\"What exactly are knots, those sore, tight spots in your muscles?

Just select 'EXPORT' on the main file menu.  This may not be implemented in earlier versions, of course, in which case you're on your own!!!  Also, I seem to think that the s/w for the QCR-Z (at the time) did strange (and very undesirable) things if ANY part of the pic was outside the screen area on Corel.  I once spent an afternoon painfully discovering that ONE pixel had somehow strayed off-screen, causing my whole slide to be blank!!!  The QCR-Z also couldn't handle grad-fill over grad-fill - so if you use a graduated colour background, if you then grad-fill an object on top of this, the fill appears on the final slide as a circle (I think) and TOTALLY IGNORES the shape of the object being filled!!!

TORTURE.  /* Written  4:41 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */ /* ---------- \\\"From Israeli press. TORTURE.\\\" ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.  Newspaper: Ma'ariv Date: 18. December 1992 Author: Avi Raz  Subject: Torture  Title of article: Moderate physical pressure  Several times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation room in Tulkarm prison, during which he says he was humiliated, beaten and tortured, Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator, a Shabak agent 'Captain Louis', chatting on the phone with his wife. \\\"At those moments\\\", Omar said, \\\"I felt that he was like a humanbeing, but right after he finished talking, he would be beat me and say, 'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed yourself' and I understood that he was not really a human being\\\".  In late October 1992, after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm prison, Omar Jaber was released without charges. \\\"Among the Jews, as among the Arabs, there are good people and bad people\\\", he said after his release, \\\"but there, in Tulkarm, in the interrogations rooms, you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that he is a human being\\\". Although he left the detention installation in Tulkarm bruised and humiliated (\\\"I sat at home for ten days. My hands shook from nerves\\\"), one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: He got out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returned to normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns.  In contrast, Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi, for example, was released seven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the Shabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. He doesn't speak or react. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early August and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, left it one day later - dead. \\\"We have recently received an especially large number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at the Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators\\\", noted Dr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel and Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights. (...)  The right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan Saber Makhlouf, a 20 year old student. In fact, he was extremely fearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated in Tulkarm prison, in case the publication in the paper would return him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment.  (...follow description of tortures....)  Omar, a tall bearded man, was silent. \\\"I do not want to talk about it\\\", he finally said, quietly. Some time later, embarrased and ashamed, he spoke: \\\"Sometimes he beats you and beats you until you'll kiss his hand, and not only his hand. Even the hands of another interrogator, and another, whom he calls into the room, later if I want, you will kiss my ass.\\\"  These things take place in an Israeli army detention installation, located within the military government compound in Tulkarm (West Bank). But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In early March the IDF allowed representatives of B'Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories, to visit Tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogation wing. \\\"The interrogation wing is Shabak property, being solely under Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed by it\\\", said Lieutnant Sharon Sho'an, the commander of the installation, according to the internal report written by B'tselem member, Yuval Ginbar, following the visit. Major David Pe'er, governing commander of the prison system in the Central Command, was quoted in the report:  \\\"There is an ethical problem here - no one can enter the interrogation wing\\\".\",\"Are any readers of s.r.c. going to the Love Europe congress in Germany this July?\",\"FYI...I just posted this on alt.psychoactives as a response to what the group is for......

The researchers examined the     women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection  were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.      The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.   It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The    researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some     brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus          thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used   in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a          protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to   try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists      acidophilus in its contents.                                             --- end ---                                                ===================================  InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92   THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED   ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS   MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

In some circumstances, though, the     organisms proliferate, producing symptomatic infection of the mouth,     intestines, vagina, or skin. When the mouth or vagina are infected, the  disease is commonly called thrush.                                         Vaginitis caused by Candida often afflicts women on birth control      pills or antibiotics. There is itching and a white, cheesy discharge.    Among narcotic addicts, Candida infections can lead to heart valve       inflammation.                                                              Diagnosis of Candida infections is confirmed by cultures and blood     tests. Treatment can be with amphotericin B or orally with ketoconazole. There is no evidence that Candida in the intestine of normal individuals leads to disease. All people at one time or another have Candida in      their intestines. Claims for any benefit from special diets or chronic   antifungal agents is not based on any solid evidence.                    --- end ---    ========================== I hope this is informative.

I know it is very contrary to the American NRA ethos of the right to bear arms, but Christians should rely on the strength of God to protect them.  Note that I say *should*.  We are inherently insecure but I feel that that is not proper justification to be armed to the teeth.  A Christian should not have to rely on physical weapons to defend himself.  A Christian should rely on his faith and intelligence. For instance, I have the faith that God will protect me but God also gave me the intelligence to know not to go walking down that dark alley at night.

Mostly, that means water turning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would  also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.  As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in a dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private ownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe condition. If any random private citizen could not properly keep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation is clearly appropriate.    I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community. If you look at the American  revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves from, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They didn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for  example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same old regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and destroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate. But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited for that.  There is also the question of personal and collective arms: The Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers other arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example) a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively) should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a  disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower. The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely democratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only 50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would be proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular will were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the form of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's firepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not of the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite different from the general public (at the very least, they would be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and character of the militia requires that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal weapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.\",\"Can anyone tell me if a bloodcount of 40 when diagnosed as hypoglycemic is dangerous, i.e. indicates a possible pancreatic problem?

Neil Smith                     LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE  [AUTHOR'S NOTE:  \\\"Adrian\\\" -- name changed to protect the guilty --  and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with  the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]  Dear Adrian:    I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to  your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and  generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist  mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back  with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present  now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the  future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.    There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger  of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan.  10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition,  shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic  rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll  limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent  with your note.    First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Second, publication of some latter-day \\\"scientific study\\\" doesn't  alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my  interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.    Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Fourth, as often happens with these things, the \\\"study\\\" doesn't  support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions  anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older  body of lies, omissions, and distortions.    Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on  countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this  present \\\"study\\\" dubious, to say the least.    Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat  (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you  should be better aware than most people how \\\"progress\\\" -- in  designing \\\"studies\\\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our  ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree  on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30  years to create \\\"studies\\\" \\\"proving\\\" that pornography causes crime.   More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s  clearly indicate the contrary.    Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Tenth, another reason to doubt all such \\\"studies\\\" is that human  behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The  attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the  resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.    Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Twelfth, the \\\"study\\\" is also worthless because it incorporates  figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but  basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social  benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a  criminal offense.    Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials  quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are  many), are correct in this instance:  the \\\"study\\\" is meaningless  because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    And because of that, Adrian, even if the \\\"study\\\" were valid, it  wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that  anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however,  whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's  permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists  themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed  people to go out and buy their first gun \\\"while they still can\\\".   Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \\\"shooting fraternity\\\"  viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate,  ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in  the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys,  and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we  probably manufacture at least that many every year.  The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly  aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what  their real motives are.    Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way,  it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic;  the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the  self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing  this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a  quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \\\"half life\\\"  of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna  be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.  As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law  provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I  will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is  that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands  -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can  only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given  both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics  and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.    So what's the point?    L.

As I can find no Scripture (have I missed it ?) that details when you are married, I have to make some assumptions based on the PRINCIPLES of Scripture.    It seems to me that it takes 3 parties to make a marriage: husband-to-be, wife-to-be, and God.  If you promise before each other and God that you will convenant together to be married, then...you are (IMO).  So why do we have the ceremonial part ?  That seems to be there for \\\"connectedness\\\" in the Body of Christ.  My brothers and sisters ought to be involved so that there can be some accountability on both our parts.  That's part of the concept from Hebrews about \\\"not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together as is the custom of some.\\\"  We need each other because Lone Ranger Christians and Lone Ranger Marriages smack of a self sufficiency that the I don't see in the NT.  Does anyone see the Paul Simon \\\"I am a rock, I am an island...\\\" model anywhere in Christianity. (Song lyrics show your age :-) ) ?  Further, since marriage is a legal matter/institution in the USA and many other places, and such laws do not specifically go crosswise to the clear teachings of Scripture, we ought to obey them to avoid even the appearance of \\\"evil\\\" (I Thess 5:22)  So this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage, but keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the  conscience of others because back to the beginning...you are married when you and your intended promise each other and God to be in convenant.

However, I think you should wait for version 2.0 (I think it will be out soon).\",\"  And some comments, with some players deleted.   Yep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the #1 spot.  It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.    Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean. --  Dale J.

Adams (starowl@a2i.rahul.net)   Champaign, IL / southeast AL\",\"Firstly, I am an atheist. I am not posting here as an immature flame start, but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience.  The meaning of my existence is a question I ask myself daily.  I live  in fear of what will happen when I  die.     I bet some of you are licking your lips now, because you think that I'm a person on the edge of accepting jeezus.               I was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years of religious educational institutions..  I know the bible well. So well I can recognize many passages from memory.    <<****Strong opinions start here...****>>  1) The human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced mental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable.  (For example the ancient Greeks believed that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  Due to the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.    Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are  because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind.  \\\"Oh wow..all i have to do is  follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness.\\\" For all of you \\\"found jeezus\\\" , how many of you were \\\"on the brink?\\\"  but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.   We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we die.        Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG. Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high.   It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.  When Christians see a \\\"non-believer\\\", they say that person is blind to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet #37696  who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans were (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need.  I must go.

The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example, was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign. His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound.  Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately.  I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.  I seem to recall CM pitching well initially, though I don't have stats handy.\",\" [...]  Wait a minute, Doug.  I know you are better informed than that.  The US  has never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada  from the Cubans to protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion  of a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).   Vietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess  we \\\"invaded\\\" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have  invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles  for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from  Spain.  So if you mean by the word \\\"invaded\\\" some sort of military action where we cross someone's border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally \\\"invaded\\\" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation. (If some nation \\\"invades\\\" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be invading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)  So from this point of view, your score falls to 2 out of 6 (Mexico, Panama).  [...]  No, it's someone who believes in \\\"peace-at-all-costs\\\".  In other words, a person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and Czechoslakia, but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And one who would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews, slavs, and political  dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.  \\\"Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik,\\\" you ask?  Well, it depends on what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace over freedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you than life itself; if you'd rather die fighting for liberty than live under a tyrant's heel, then yes, it's \\\"bad\\\" to be a peace-nik.  The problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are not like them to be \\\"bad\\\" and \\\"unconscionable\\\".  I would not have any argument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and stayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with  the national defense.  But no, they are not willing to allow us to legitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and  many times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rank hypocrisy!)

Where the session key is K, and is transmitted encrypted in the unit Key U. Which along with the serial number N is encrypted in the Family key F.  Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The function of this spoof chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the family key   2) Receive Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the      law enforcement block is necessary for local operation -      checksums, sequence control, etc.).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere is a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bits as used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement block can be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas, no one has proposed Federal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves, The correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits of N in E[N; F].  The one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but the mutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate the entire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme such as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block can be recovered are lessened.  What do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the serial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission becomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?  One way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block containing M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.  The goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to  detection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law enforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state for use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.  It is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within the clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for, requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting and decrypting E(M; K);  The spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including on the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products could be subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?  Super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without redress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial number.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which should not be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs for procurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough, stealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nice from a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated with a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and  distribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen clipper serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not  sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream. This could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted stream.  Detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned scheme.  ******************************************************************************  If you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and use them in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a valid law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching the remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yet deliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement block.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators, such as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.  The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream and the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between endpoints.  The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission interception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's supposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants an encryption chip with a real time clock?  *****************************************************************************\",\"# # I remember seeing something in the X distribution mentioning support # for a Tektronix terminal in an X server.

For example, Article IV: \\\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated\\\"; Article V: \\\"no person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment by a Grand Jury ...  nor shall any person ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\\\"; Article VIII: \\\"excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted\\\".

Among others, see Olney's  \\\"Excitotoxic Food Aditives - Relevance of Animal Studies to Human Safety\\\" (1982) Neurobehav. Toxicol. Teratol. vol 6: 455-462.  I'm sure PETA would love to hear your arguments.   Whose talking about \\\"food science\\\"? What is this comment supposed to mean? *Neurotoxicology and Tratology*, *Brain Research*, *Nature*, *Progress in Brain Research*: all fine food science journals. ;-)   Then you would know that Olney himself has casually  referred to \\\"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\\\" in a few articles. Why don't *you* point us to some studies? Maybe then this exchange could be productive.   They're unable to metabolise it.   Who said anything about 'received wisdom'? There is no question that orally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence. These areas are responsible for the production of hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now what, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing? Are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary, ANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone?   How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It's unethical to \\\"sacrifice\\\" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food industry knows this. That's why the animal model is used in medicine and psych.  If you're talking about straight sensitivity, it would be useful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and physiology.  I suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities (You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its implication for adults (me).  Certainly the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than for the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious and increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their hidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels* attained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC.    Olney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for some sensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally administered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH is responsible not only for control of growth during development, but also converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause of headaches?

For example, is this a public key system or a private key system? If the latter, then I don't see how the system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and not the person).  Further, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks. I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks and a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic. I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system, but it does make you think. Of course, this is easily fixable by  giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the  real 80-bit key.\",\" Do you have the specs for this monitor?

GB> I hope you meant \\\"inarguably\\\".  Given the choice, I would rather argue <g>.  No arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is that aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of Leao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and secondary neuronal ischemia).  Migraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  There do not seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The Copenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF studies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura, but like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.  From one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in the absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From another (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of the specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache, therefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.  Whether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling headaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic colleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients they can get.

And Windows 3.1 is also flexible enough at install time that you can copy all the files onto your hard disk, which greatly speeds things up and makes them less annoying, if you can spare the 7 or so compressed megs.   No, we're not.  But we're also not going to promote pandering to corporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience.  I don't *like* dealing with floppies.  Personally, I have no use for changing the registration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to be solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour reinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one way or another.  So, while I'm not going to put much time into it myself, here's the procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:  1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want to install it.  I've been using c:\\\\WINSTALL myself.  2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\\\\WINORIG.  3.  Install from c:\\\\winstall.  4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.       i.e., comp *.* \\\\winorig\\\\*.* >\\\\report.txt  5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming they didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one file should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate said offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hex editor, and do the same for the modified one.  6.  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don't really do cryptography.  It's probably just an xor key or something; I think MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing his copy than with \\\"real pirates\\\" who will probably just disassemble the damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original floppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able to back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a compare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).  As I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and don't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one directory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff I've mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if they'd ever find out.

Will Mathcad 4.0 be happy with this, or insist on a swap file? \",\" The \\\"so sacred it's secret\\\" explanation is a bit misleading.  While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.   There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).  Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \\\"You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you\\\" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.   But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few:  1. \\\"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given\\\" (Matt. 13:11).  2. \\\"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\\\" (Matt. 19:11).  3. \\\"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\\\" (John 16:12).  4. \\\"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father\\\" (John 16:25).  5. \\\"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\\\" (1 Cor. 3:1-2).  6. \\\"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face\\\" (2 Jn. 1:12).  (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.   Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------          Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City                     jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu\",\"Could be due to the rear-end ratio also.

That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying that they are infallible.  Impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will probably agree.  In short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning, then those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved, there is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing \\\"There is no way out of the loop.\\\"   Someone called `REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but he did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase Sartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism.  As I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false because you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because   However, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX' has written does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does not like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.   *  There were two sentences in `REXLEX's post that seemed relevant to the point at hand:   I do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I have, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don't claim to be infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I do claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.  However, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about them, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier article.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted in very limited circumstances.    But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said, exactly, \\\"This is my body.\\\"  We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Why should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be fallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?  So, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is that Jesus said \\\"This is my body.\\\"  Beyond that, once we start making up doctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we get into trouble.  Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they cannot be certain.    That is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know that human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not believe we are infallible, any more than we do.  When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you are either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying to cover them up.  I think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what things we are only \\\"very confident\\\" of.  For example, we might say that we know our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But other things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical thinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are very confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.  But, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting as if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.   *  `REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by Francis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of it, but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody else might like it, though, so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.  If someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Certainty_, by Ludwig Wittgenstein. \",\"Hmmm...

I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be    contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction    and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?    What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that    Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?    This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically    stood by the Pope.  The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This is the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his departure from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands from *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be disobeyed.  My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it would be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the present situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated. Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the Catholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.     It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is    disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over    authority and discipline.    The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic Faith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the Catholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.  There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the Catholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an hour, probably.  Take the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book on what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio de Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old catechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the Catholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He innoculated the people against what was coming.  Well, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came when the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope recovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really wanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence. The Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.  The injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop was installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's clergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New Mass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass. The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop was *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The priests would just start building new churches; the people were completely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the bishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.  The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to canon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V. Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.  During all this process, the people of Campos, not just private individuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending petitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist bishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome. Eventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.     My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)     If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.    If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and    there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that    I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end of the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in Catholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an instant non-Catholic.  The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are doing, they would be shocked!     We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\"    traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter    East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.  This isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body of traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are especially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is.     I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow    error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`    I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  That's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job since the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors spread that it's pitiful.  Infallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the short term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In fact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large sections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been much more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long run.     What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement    regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how    do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?    Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.    Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,    one way or the other.  Yes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what is he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of the Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic schools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?     It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the    Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\",\" I think you can do this with REGEDIT, which can make changes to the OLE registration database.

The games that I seek have straight slots for the defenseman, not the S shaped slots.  The players are attatched to rods operated with springs.

They all accept a file as a command line  parameter, but the only way (at least that I know of) to do this easily when running them from windows is to set up the PIF file so that it prompts me for additional parameters (at which point I type  in the file name).    Problems are:   1) Sometimes I can't remember where the file is exactly located and it would be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the file manager.       and 2) I'm lazy and hate to type long pathnames for files burried  several directory levels deep.   If anyone can point me to such a program or let me know of some other way to handle this, I'd appreciate it.

The first attempt failed in the summer  of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules  state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started  after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).  This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and  comp.os.os2.bugs.   This document contains:  *  the background showing the need for these proposals  *  the proposed charters for these proposals  *  voting instructions  *  a voting ballot  *  some example ballots  *  the voting rules  *  the voting schedule  *  the Mass Acknowledgement   Background:   The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2  and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred  a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such  as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and  much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,  allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.   Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and  later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the  number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility  with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the  availability of drivers for their hardware, installation  procedures, etc.   Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows  Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is  including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version  2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).   Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,  especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.  So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks  (e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or  for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read  comp.os.os2.misc for details).   Proposed Charters:   (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so   as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and   spur additional development.  The group will also cover   topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,   Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program   portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and   so forth.   (b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)    To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy   orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to   comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup   for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and   technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.   (c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)    It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the   availability of device drivers, compatibility information,   installation procedures, system requirements, and overall   performance optimization.   (d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.   (e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug   diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system   patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.    [Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other   newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in   comp.os.os2.beta]   How to Vote:   To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.  Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this  post.  Be sure to send only the ballot, and edit out the rest of  this post.   1)  Type in your vote for each proposal:       If you favor the charter as proposed, put a \\\"yes\\\" after its name.      If you oppose the charter as proposed, put a \\\"no\\\" after its name.      To abstain, leave a blank after its name.   2)  Type in your last name (i.e. your family name), a comma, and      your first name (i.e. your personal name).   3)  Cut out the ballot,  Please do not delete any lines of the      ballot.   4)  E-mail your ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu before 11:59:59 pm      (Central Time), April 24, 1993.   Ballot:  ----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----          (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting:         (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc:         (c)              comp.os.os2.setup:         (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:         (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs:          (f)       voter's last, first name:          e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24  ----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------   Example Ballot #1:   (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes  (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes  (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no  (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:  (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: no   (f)       voter's last, first name: Smith, John   In this example, John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting  to be created, and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to  comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of  comp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view  on the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia.    Example Ballot #2:   (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes  (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes  (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes  (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes  (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes   (f)       voter's last, first name: Doe, Jane   In this example, Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all  the proposals.   Voting Rules:   * One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most    recent vote will be counted.   * Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,    forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.   * Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings    will be revealed only after the poll closes.   * I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will    post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).   * If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how    voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.    Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is    posted to news.answers on a regular basis.   * If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this    CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.   * When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal    passes if both of the following formulas are true:    1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes        by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).    2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the        number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).    In other words, a proposal passes if:        YES - NO >= max (100, NO)    where max() returns the highest number given to it.   Schedule:   The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted  by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).   This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the  Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who  have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you  have not voted yet, vote now!   The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on  April 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.  The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that  date.   Mass Acknowledgement:   Here is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots  as of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15, 1993:                            bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu Aiyagari,

Islamic Fundamentalists just have a \\\"better\\\" excuse (Qu'ran).       from the Vancouver Sun, Thursday, October 4, 1990     by John Davidson, Canadian Press       MONTREAL-- Perhaps it's the letter to the five-year old     daughter that shocks the most.       \\\"I hope one day you will be old enough to understand what     happened to your parents,\\\" wrote Patrick Prevost. \\\"I loved     your mother with a passion that went as far as hatred.\\\"       Police found the piece of paper near Prevost's body in his     apartment in northeast Montreal.       They say the 39-year-old mechanic committed suicide after     killing his wife, Jocelyne Parent, 31.       The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had     gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money     for food. A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked     his wife with a kitchen knife, cutting her throat, police said.       She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or     lover in Quebec in the last five weeks.       Five children have also been slain as a result of the same     domestic \\\"battles.\\\"       Last year in Quebec alone, 29 [women] were slain by their     husbands. That was more than one-third of such cases across     Canada, according to statistics from the Canadian Centre for     Justice. [rest of article ommited]   Then to say that women are somehow \\\"better\\\" or \\\"should\\\" be the one to \\\"stay home\\\" and raise a child is also laughable. Women have traditionally done hard labor to support a family, often  more than men in many cultures, throughout history.

Helsingius?   * * *  _____ <8.1> What are some known anonymous remailing and posting sites?    Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites   is anon.penet.fi operated by julf@penet.fi for several months, who   has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment.    Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses    (no encryption).  Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.     Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk   remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):   pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX   scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to   aid remailer use).    ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu   -----------------------------     Anonymized mail.  Request information from above address.        elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu   -------------------------     Experimental anonymous remailer run Karl Barrus     <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU>, with encryption to the server.

Request information from above address.    phantom@mead.u.washington.edu    -----------------------------     Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site     address for information.    Notes   =====      - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often     running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues     are wholly unresolved.      - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP     software (see the question on cryptography).     - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)     vary between sites.    - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are     mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.  _____ <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?       Users   -----    - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the     seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.   - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.   - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on     Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.   - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.     Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases     network traffic.   - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this     is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'     hierarchy is preferred.   - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.     references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for     readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any     inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even     future ones under the same handle.   - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your     identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by     sending anonymized mail to yourself.   - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them.      Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.   - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.   - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.     Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.   - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large     amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating     his hardware, all for your convenience.    Operators   ---------    - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an     introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and     consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and     monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and     security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or     lassaiz-faire?   - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate     potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user     is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user     posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your     users trust you to protect them.   - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations     where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.     warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke     the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)   - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.     Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly     and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with     users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under     ``(in)stability of anonymity''.   - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?     What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is     your commitment to it?   - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an     address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item.      Consult a lawyer about your liability.   - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared     to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you     do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system     adminstrator, consult those who do and are.   - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If     possible, query group readers.   - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message     format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure     the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.   - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from     physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.    Readers   -------      - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason     that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that     equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail     anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its     volume is heavy or increasing).   - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters     will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate     responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.   - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,     harassment, extortion, etc.   - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they     offend you personally.   - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the     idea of anonymity itself.   - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings     should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or     `conceivable' need exists.

It accepts the need of a system   > operator to know the name of a user; but suggests that the use of   > a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a   > letter to the editor. The article concludes with a set of   > guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous.  _____ <8.3> How do I `kill' anonymous postings?    James Thomas Green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>:    > Try putting this in your kill file:   >      >   /Anon/h:j   >   /Anonymous/h:j   >    > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that   > contain `Anon' or `Anonymous' in them.  Not perfect and won't   > kill followups.       Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask   anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so   far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common   as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.    _____ <8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?    Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for   individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is   almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion   and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack   started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was   wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)   but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided   anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up   the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous   alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through   servers like there's no tomorrow.''      Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in   researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste   <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system   from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the   server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,   and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by   multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended   advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group   support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was   arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.''    K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an   anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus   against it.     K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to   `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and   used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of   intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his   server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to   abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the   facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was   created.''    In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most   controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on   scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized   mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine   the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide   accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.      J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet   newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological   opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).   Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,   abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than   ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of   anonymity is also controversial.    For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb   1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate   crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via   anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been   posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then   non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a   New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of   vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating   through many newsgroups.       The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded   that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''   suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was   not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of   the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived   association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries   for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous   user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his   detractors.    Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal   opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news   operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire   extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the   scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is   best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users   in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a   day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized   through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due   to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to   find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.    Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to   dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste   threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate   news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages   originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to   threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several   times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it   by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5   hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the   service's administration. In response to the serious threats he   disabled global group access temporarily for one week and   encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.      Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by   ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security   weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is   currently in the process of code development and testing. He is   planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon   to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new   system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple   email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,   etc.    A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.   1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography   in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of   confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public   access account, and he had to shut it down after only several   weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately   originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the   software to the public domain.    Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on   government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and   group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the   group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,   and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable   digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in   the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to   attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing   easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and   encryption.

I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now. The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it. A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi). The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards.  (He said he will replace the components before selling the car to me.)  Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don't know what this could mean... Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items? Or is this an indication that the car was abused? Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon? The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but, I don't know how to verify this...  I've seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though.  Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept, it's currently out of warranty (a similarly priced '90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km worth of warranty left) and I don't want to worry about paying for any repair bills... But, I also need a car for 5 people...    When will the new Maxima come out, by the way?  I would very much appreciate your input in this. Please reply by e-mail (preferred) or post in this newsgroup. Thanks!  Ryan  \",\" [rest deleted...]  You were a liberal arts major, weren'tcha?

Steve> Steve Frysinger  Your might take a look a PLPLOT.  Version 4.99c (actually beta v5.0) can be found anonymous ftp from hagar.ph.utexas.edu, in the pub/plplot  directory.    --Mark  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------    From the README file of version 4.99c:   This is the PLPLOT distribution.  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for  many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size  and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard  x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,  bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)  may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different  line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of  distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in  the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek  alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts  can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device  drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile  format and renderer.   The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.  The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly  granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without  consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT  object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it  is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely  available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed  somewhere in the documentation for the package.   We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of  user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any  published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,  which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that  as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the  kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest  in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only  afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on  those which help us get our work done.   PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically  without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub  routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any  modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the  header file \\\"plplot.h\\\"; see the documentation for more details.   The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of  several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex  plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to  the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained  there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.     At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:    Unix: SunOS    A/IX     HP-UX    Unicos    DG/UX    Ultrix    SysV    Linux    Amiga/Exec   MS-DOS   OS/2   NeXT   For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:   - appendices to the PLPLOT manual   - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

EMAIL   amr@egr.duke.edu\",\" I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of the discussion: one the dice are out there, it won't be long before someone decaps it and, after a bit of work, has full details of the Clipper algorythm.  This isn't trivial to do, but then again, it is not impossibly difficult either.  Any half way decent VLSI design student should be able to take a photograph of a technology s/he is familiar with, and given a description of the input, output, control and supply lines, figure out  the function of various subsystems on the die.  Indeed, this is not an uncommon exercise performed during training (because it makes you think about design decisions made by other designers.  I could speculate that these chips are going to be manufactured using \\\"tamperproof\\\" carriers (unlikely - such techniques are *very* expensive and this thing is supposed to be relatively cheap to produce), or that there will be some legal or legislative framework to prevent publication of the algorythm (unlikely - please correct me if I am wrong but aren't these supposed to be sold internationally?).  I suppose that the most likely reason the algorythm is remaining secret for the moment is that some idiot bureaucrat, untrammeled by the realities of the situation, decided that \\\"well, we should keep it a secret because it is supposed to be secret, isn't it?\\\"  Just some random thoughts... \",\"Hello everyone.  I'm new to motorcycles so no flames please.  I don't have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:  1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have  to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too  ignorant to know I need to buy)  2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in  about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a  motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes a difference)  3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?  4)  In DC, as I imagine it is in every other state (OK, OK, we're not a  state - we're not bitter ;)), you take the written test first and then get a learners permit.  However, I'm wondering how one goes about  learning to ride the bike proficiently enough so as to a) get a liscence and b) not kill oneself.  I don't know anyone with a bike who could  teach me, and the most advice I've heard is either \\\"do you live near a field\\\" or \\\"do you have a friend with a pickup truck\\\", the answers to both of which are NO.  Do I just ride around my neighborhood and hope for  the best?  I kind of live in a residential area but it's not suburbs. It's still the big city and I'm about a mile from downtown so that  doesn't seem too viable.  Any stories on how you all learned?

One reply, which I have lost, suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses, one  of which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan.  By coincidence, last week's _America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles  Bourke, Corpus Christi's pastor emeritus.  Fr. Bourke also directed the NT  translation in the New American Bible.  He noted \\\"...certain practices have  been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality,  and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy.\\\"  I note that at my  parents' parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the  offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word \\\"risen\\\".  This was not a  kiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 Mass.  I wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies.  This newsgroup as a whole offers generally moderate (perhaps because it's moderated) conversation on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself). Sometimes people do go over the top, but the remarkable thing is how that is the exception, I think.  Benefits of the doubt are generally granted.  It seems so...Christian?\",\" As am I  If \\\"high quality secure NSA classified technology\\\" means handing my key over to whomever, I'll take PGP any day.  Right now they are billing it as voluntary, i.e. bend over, here it comes.  As soon as enough Wiretap chip based units are out there, how much easier do you think it will be to redefine \\\"on your own\\\" to mean write it yourself and don't even THINK about distributing it...?  Get honest, no one is going to buy this trash if they KNOW it's compromised already, and less will buy it if the algorithm is not disclosed.  The NSA knows that making this stuff available to the public means handing it to whatever foreign powers are interested in the process. Since when has export control stopped anyone (especially software wise)  Ask yourself carefully if \\\" high quality secure NSA classified technology \\\" is something they are going to hand out.  Not unless you can drive a NSA van through the holes.  uni (Dark) \",\"Boston                           2 2 0--4 Ottawa                           0 1 1--2 First period      1, Boston, Roberts 5 (Juneau) 7:19.      2, Boston, Wiemer 1(Juneau, Oates) 17:47.

This is true for all Israeli citizens no matter what their ethnicity. In the United States most official forms have RACE (Caucasian, Black, AmerIndian, etc.).   Funny, I have a number of maps and ALL of them have fixed borders.     Probably yes. So what ?      Apart from Mordechai Vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors, there was one other espionage case (the nutty professor at the Nes Ziona Biological Institute who was a K.G.B. mole) who was tried \\\"in camera\\\". I wouldn't exactly call it a state secret. The trial was simply tried behind closed doors. I hate to disappoint you but the United States has tried a number of espionage cases in camera.    Not Jews. Israeli citizens. Jordanian law is in effect in the West Bank but the KNESSET passed a law that Israeli law would be binding on Israeli citizens residing in the West Bank. These citizens could be Jews, Israeli Muslims, Druze, or Israeli Christians. It has NOTHING to do with religion.      Anyone who was registered (Jew, Muslim, Christian) could return. You might be confusing this with the census taken in June 1967 on the West Bank after the Six Day War. In *this* instance, if the Arab was not physically present he couldn't reside on the West Bank (e.g. if he had been visting Jordan).    No. Not even if you drowned him in bourbon, scotch or brandy :-)     Not true. Although a minority, there *are* some Israeli Arabs living on kibbutzim. On the other hand, at my age (42) I wouldn't be admitted to a kibbutz nor could the family join me. Not that I would be so thrilled to do so in the first place. The kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorous membership criteria. Many Israeli Jews are not admitted.    The religious status quo in Israel has marriage and divorce  handled by the religious courts. The RABBANUT handles marriage and divorce for Jews, the Muslim SHAARIA  courts are for Muslims, the Christian denominations have their religious courts, and the Druze have their own courts. The entire religious establishment (Jewish, Muslim, Druze, Christian) wants to keep it that way.   I believe it's adjacent to a former Muslim cemetary. From what I heard (and I'd like to get feedback from Muslins  on the net) sanctity of cemetaries is not held that sancrosanct as it is held by Jews. The current Israeli Ministry of Trade and Industry on Agron Road in Jerusalem is housed in a former hotel that was built by Arabs in the 1920's on the site of an Arab cemetary.

Charley,  I can't help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous posts.  I submit that you don't answer them because you cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once again challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for you as possible, I'll present concise re-statements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see.  Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I will re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at such time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this newsgroup.  I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be kind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it from this list.  Now, to the questions...  1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating that you weren't referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some atheists who you feel don't fit your patterns, to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your stereotype?  Here is the context for the question:    2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that \\\"senses and reason are all we have to go by\\\", and when pressed, you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...   then later...   then later...    3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by a.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify one such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical?  If so, please repeat them.  Here is the context for the question:    then later...    4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the \\\"axioms\\\" of reason that one couldn't help but become atheist.  I asked you to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that I have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer the question.  Please do so now.  Question: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that effect?  If you don't retract that claim, do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism?  Here is the context for the question:  [First quote] [Second quote]   5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these Challenges because they contained too much in the way of \\\"included text\\\" from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn't respond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify this seeming contradiction.  Question:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context from your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to avoid \\\"included text\\\"?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...

I would go further, and say that much of the damage to the environment has been caused by the secular worldview, or by the humanist worldview, and especially by the secular humanist worldview.  This is not to say that ALL secular humanists are necessarily avid destroyers of the environment, and I am sure that there are many who are concerned about the environment. But at the time of the Renaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre, or the focus of culture (hence \\\"humanism\\\"). This consciousness was also secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the present age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the same time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy. This doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it began to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European society and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later stages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that justified  them.  There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of \\\"economics\\\" - from the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces and powers. There were denominational differences among the new worshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was \\\"the free rein of the market mechanism\\\", while for others it was \\\"the dialectical forces of history\\\". But in both the capitalist West and the socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of Mammon.

Jim \",\" Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI-1 for hard drives YES the \\\"figure includes a hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers\\\"  This is sloppy people and DUMB.  Ok once again with the SCSI spec list: SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s  asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s. SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}  Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1  so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too.  SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit  hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1  devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds} SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak: Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower  {Range 0-5MB/s}  One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by people.

Qualifications -- one of the worse finishes in last year's prediction contest.  AL East -- 1993  1.  Baltimore Orioles Why the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to this:   -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.   -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees   -- Milwaukee was a fluke   -- Indians aren't ready to contend   -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better   -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of \\\"replacement level\\\" \\\"But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.\\\"  No.  As a matter of fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division on paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some- body has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  \\\"You don't really think that Brady Anderson is going to repeat, do you?\\\"  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  \\\"Glenn Davis?  That's insane\\\".  Yes.  So, without further ado: STRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken. WEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be   the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.   (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize   the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3   spot, why not move the rest of the line up?) WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota. ObPrediction:  \\\"The Streak\\\" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in   caught stealing.  2. New York Yankees. STRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American   League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes. WEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner    factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far   behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to   win a division. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300 WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again. ObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.  3.  Toronto Blue Jays STRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie   power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.   Guzman.  Alomar. WEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.   Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in   the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August. ObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And   have a losing record.  4.  Milwaukee Brewers STRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year. WEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year. WOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year. ObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.  5.  Cleveland Indians STRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy WEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix   Fermin. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace. ObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.  6.  Boston Red Sox STRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens WEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre   Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL ObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how   you will :->  7.  Detroit Tigers STRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker WEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.   Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.   This year could be *very* ugly. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP. ObPrediction:  Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs.  One more division to go.... --  Dale J.

I made a decision to accept the truth-claims of Christianity after having given it a lot of thought.

Also, my Calvinist should rest assured that I don't lay any of the responsibility for the outcome [my conversion] on anyone but God.)  It took me years and years for this all to happen, because I had many of the objections that this poster puts forward.  I grew up in the shadow of [generic authoritarian conservative denomination], and I *knew* that that wasn't a way of life that I could adopt.  But I gradually learned not to tar all of Christianity with the same brush, and realized quite suddenly one cold winter night that I accepted what I had heretofore rejected.

Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody giving  Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards, marginal.  Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both  shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.       Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so  liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if something  isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When  certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential  candidates, the absurdity is apparent.

But there are some very important related facts that            Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of            most other world religions.                             First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-           STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master            (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES,            a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and            after the life of Jesus.                      The followers of some of these Masters founded the            world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of            their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added            THREATS of \\\"ETERNAL DAMNATION\\\" in Hell, and DELETED the            teaching of REincarnation.                         Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular            Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is            NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively            few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY            alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE            UNIVERSES.)                                              Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and            pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from            their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed            themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly            MANUFACTURED by the Romans.                        And emotional \\\"feelings\\\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING            indicator for religious validity.                      These things are similarly true for followers of most            other major world religions, including Islam.                       Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune            His Initiates into the \\\"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\\\" or \\\"SOUND            CURRENT\\\", (referred to as \\\"THE WORD\\\" in John 1:1-5, and as            \\\"The River of Life\\\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally            guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they            are still connected to their living physical bodies by a            \\\"silver cord\\\".                      True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of            REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved            only by reaching at least the \\\"SOUL PLANE\\\", which is five            levels or universes above the physical universe, and this            canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine            Master.                      One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri            Harold Klemp, the Living \\\"Eck\\\" Master or \\\"Mahanta\\\" for the            \\\"Eckankar\\\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis,            (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427).                      Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now            living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \\\"Sant            Mat\\\" organization.                        One of the classic books on this subject is \\\"THE PATH OF            THE MASTERS\\\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA             90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian            and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India            studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of            that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji.                      Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored            by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in            most public and university libraries and some book stores, or            obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \\\"ECKANKAR--THE            KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\\\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER            classic.                      Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with            the \\\"Anti-Christ\\\", which is or was to be a temporary world            dictator during the so-called \\\"last days\\\".  But the Masters            don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as            Jesus was.                      People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or            other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will            CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the            Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they            finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine            Master.                                 RE-INCARNATION                           The book \\\"HERE AND HEREAFTER\\\", by Ruth Montgomery,            describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation            as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past            lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes            makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist],            SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of            whom can identify their most recent previous relatives,            homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-           ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-           ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-           ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS            FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the            Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How            can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED            BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \\\"KING JAMES VERSION\\\".  Later            versions are PER-VERSIONS! ]                            Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc.,            typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example,            a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually            results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.             And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to            another person being met for the first time in THIS life,            because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS            INCARNATION.                  The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF            KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would            behave much better toward each other if they knew that their            actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the            future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION!               \\\"2nd COMINGS\\\"                 If a Divine Master physically dies (\\\"translates\\\")            before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that            Initiate physically dies (\\\"translates\\\"), the Master will meet            him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul            Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd            Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that            happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still            waiting for Jesus' \\\"2nd Coming\\\" are WAITING IN VAIN.                                       PLANES OF EXISTENCE                 The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN            major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the            Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric            Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane),            the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The            Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from            the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the            Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes.                      It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological            influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See            the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without            an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between            the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane.                      The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a            sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \\\"Hades\\\", and the            Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there            LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some            kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a            THREATENING manner.  The Christian \\\"Heaven\\\" is located            elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there            for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth.                                             SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH                 The Christian religion demands of its followers an            extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more            than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING).                         If a person is not HEARING some form of the \\\"SOUND            CURRENT\\\" (\\\"THE WORD\\\", \\\"THE BANI\\\", \\\"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\\\"),            then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL            CONTINUE.                      The \\\"SOUND CURRENT\\\" manifests differently for different            Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on            the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a            flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.

I'm looking for books that showing how to fix your own hardware problem.  Please let me know if you have any books in mind.  Thanks. \",\" I agree with what Darren has to say here, but would like to add a  personal observation.  What I see as arrogance and the problem I have  with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just  Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.    Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal  sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these  matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them  but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus  anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that leads to arrogance.  In my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)    comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\",\"Hi Xperts, some simple questions for you:  I've seen a lot of different terms, which seem to mean the same thing.

(I think it was glues and such, as well as electronics, that they were worried about.)  Thus it had to remain furled and the axis _always_ pointed near the sun, so that the small sunshade at the tip of the antenna mast would shadow the folded HGA. (A larger sunshade beneath the antenna shielded the spacecraft bus.)\",\" Let's get back to basics.  Canon (from the latin) means a rule.  If we say that a rule is open then its a rule made to be broken.   There is an issue also of measurement against a rule.  Thus the words that are spoken need to be compared against the rule/canon but not added to the canon.  Is new revelation necessary?  Topical, current, personal revelation I'd say is necessary.  New revelation for all people for all times is not necessary as we have that in Scripture.  You also seem to confuse canon with scripture.  Scripture may speak of itself being open - ie God speaking today.  It would speak that it is closed in the sense that the canon is unchangeable.  (Though the concept of canon is later historically.)   I agree with the problem of confusion.  If prophecy is meant to encourage, exhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture.  If prophecy is meant to bring a `word' of the form \\\"the man you live with is not your husband\\\" then that is knowledge.  Yet the exact words their are scripture. I would expect the difference to be the motive and means for delivery. The reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force.  Regards  David\",\"  Note that I said the fall of Rome, not of the Empire.  The Roman Empire lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The main reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by the men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city of Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of Mazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter of time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto the rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle should be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of Constantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greeks had wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the Crusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd Crusades?  Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they considered heretics, even though those \\\"heretics\\\" were fighting for the cause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkish hordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the some hordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third of Europe (the Balkans, Hungary, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.)\",\"The system, or 'family', key would appear to be cryptographically useless, since *every* chip must know it and be able to remove its effects from the bitstream.

It is the \\\"X Window System\\\", or \\\"X11\\\", or \\\"X\\\" or any of a number of other designations accepted by the X Consortium.  In fact, doing \\\"man X\\\" on pretty much any X11 machine will tell you:       The X Consortium requests that the following names  be  used      when referring to this software:                                    X                            X Window System                              X Version 11                      X Window System, Version 11                                  X11  There is no such thing as \\\"X Windows\\\" or \\\"X Window\\\", despite the repeated misuse of the forms by the trade rags.  This probably tells you something about how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME of the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have  to say?  With regard to dialup X11 implementations, there are several.  You can buy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both  GraphOn and NCD.  (In fact, I'm composing this from an NCD running X11 over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.)    NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is NCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such  software packages available.  X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running X11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and  is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote.

Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.  I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?  Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost?  I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?

It also has a very extensive reference  list covering essentially all of the reference material in the  field.]       MAP PROJECTIONS AND SPHERICAL TRIGNOMETRY      Two easy-to-find sources of map projections are the \\\"Encyclopaedia     Brittanica\\\", (particularly the older volumes) and a tutorial appearing     in _Graphics Gems_ (Academic Press, 1990). The latter was written with     simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind     (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).      More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John     Snyder's USGS publication \\\"Map Projections--A Working Manual\\\", USGS     Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32     projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both     spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a     neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.      You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,     \\\"An Album of Map Projections\\\", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This     contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are     in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.      You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:     Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National     Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and     tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.      A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos,     (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call     them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a     check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up     for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.      A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:   R. Miller and F. Reddy, \\\"Mapping the World in Pascal\\\",  Byte V12 #14, December 1987   Contains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections. A  demo program, CARTOG.PAS, and a small (6,000 point) coastline data  is available on CompuServe, GEnie, and many BBSs.      Some references for spherical trignometry are:   _Spherical Astronomy_, W.M. Smart, Cambridge U. Press, 1931.   _A Compendium of Spherical Astronomy_, S. Newcomb, Dover, 1960.   _Spherical Astronomy_, R.M. Green, Cambridge U. Press., 1985 (update  of Smart).   _Spherical Astronomy_, E Woolard and G.Clemence, Academic  Press, 1966.

SKY (UNIX EPHEMERIS PROGRAM)      The 6th Edition of the Unix operating system came with several software     systems not distributed because of older media capacity limitations.     Included were an ephmeris, a satellite track, and speech synthesis     software. The ephmeris, sky(6), is available within AT&T and to sites     possessing a Unix source code license. The program is regarded as Unix     source code. Sky is <0.5MB. Send proof of source code license to   E.

Convert parallax into distance using the     formula in part 6 of the FAQ, convert RA and declination to coordinates     on a unit sphere (see some of the references on planetary positions and     spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this), and     scale this by the distance.      Two databases useful for this purpose are the Yale Bright Star catalog     (sources listed in FAQ section 3) or \\\"The Catalogue of Stars within 25     parsecs of the Sun\\\" (in pub/SPACE/FAQ/stars.data and stars.doc on     ames.arc.nasa.gov). \",\"I am looking for Ultima V for the IBM, I would like the entire package (meaning I need more than just the game, I would like the Docs also) Since it is an old game I do not want to pay a lot of money. If you are interested in selling this game please respond to this message. \",\"Can anybody tell me how to use the Xmu function \\\"XmuCvtStringToWidget\\\". I want to specify a widget name in a resource file so that I can connect two widgets together on an XmForm. ie.  MyProggy*MyListSW.topWidget:               MainTextSW  However, when I run the program, I get the message:  Warning: No type converter registered for 'String' to 'Window' conversion.  (Just like the manual sez).  I have managed to find this bit of code which seems to be the correct way to go about this:      static XtConvertArgRec parentCvtArgs[] = {         {             XtWidgetBaseOffset,             (XtPointer)XtOffsetOf( CoreRec, core.parent ),             sizeof(CoreWidget)         }     };      XtSetTypeConverter( XtRString, XtRWidget, XmuCvtStringToWidget,                             parentCvtArgs, XtNumber(parentCvtArgs), XtCacheAll,                                NULL );   However, I haven't got a clue where to put it! The example code I have seems to suggest I can only do this if I am creating my own widget; but elsewhere it says that I can add it to a widget's \\\"class_intialize\\\" function. HOW? What's one of those? :-(  If anybody has any code to do this, please let me know the trick - I'm sure this is a FAQ.  Thanks in advance,  Rik.

That you're willing to throw out freedom-of-speech for the sake of protecting the reputation of the royal sluts.  That the British government advertised in American newspapers \\\"Send A Gun to Defend a British Home -- British civilians, faced with threat of invasion, desperately need arms for the defense of their homes.\\\" during WWII.  [American Rifleman November, 1940]  That The Obscene Publications Act and the Misuse of Drugs Act have been used as justification for the police to seize masterpieces such as William S. Burrough's \\\"Junky\\\", Hunter Thompson's \\\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\\", and Tom Wolfe's \\\"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\\\".  British courts have never recognized the right to assemble or to demonstrate.  That evidence obtained form coerced confessions is allowed in a trial.  That only serious felonies warrant a trial by jury.  That suspected terrorists must prove their innocence, instead of the government having to prove their guilt.  That the secretary of state may issue an \\\"exclusionary order\\\" which bars someone from ever entering a particular part of the United Kingdom, such as Northern Ireland or Wales.  That the BBC banned Paul McCartney's \\\"Give Ireland Back to the Irish\\\" as well as John Lennon's \\\"Give Peace a Chance\\\" during the Gulf War.  Yes, England is very very funny.  And very pathetic.   So what.  Laughter is a way of dealing with things we find uncomfortable. I thought the \\\"Las Vegas Show Girl\\\" ads on Las Vegas street corners were pretty funny.  Yes indeed, there are many strange and wonderous things in this country. I wouldn't have it any other way.   I don't disagree with that, I don't think it's bad either.   So what.  If they didn't come from here they would come from elsewhere disguised as cocaine.   You can laugh all you want, for us it's a matter of life or death. I don't find that funny in the least.  As for England:  \\\"As our allies become more open, Britain grow yet more secretive and censorious.  Perhaps the real British vice is passivity, a willingness to tolerate constraints which others would find unbearble.\\\" [in \\\"Britain, An Unfree Country\\\" by Terrence DeQuesne and Edward Goodman, pp 33.]\",\" Personally, i wouldn't use the $1.29 product from KMart. I knew about this previously, but this past weekend on PBS's MotorWeek Pat Goss  (their resident tech type) discussed these products, and recommends not using them (i.e, the non-isopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners).  Supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors.  And although the  others (ethyl based) do clean injectors they also cause rubber  components in the fuel system to deteriorate, and they don't mix well with water to help remove it from the fuel system.  I use a product recommended by VW called 44K (by BG Products, Inc.). It cost more about $14.00, but it is supposed to do the job without the potential harmful side effects, and its results are supposed to  last from 2k to 4k miles. I have also used Chevron's Techtrolene (sp?).

Thus, Hasan is wrong.   The word \\\"troops\\\" is unjustified.  There has never been any evidence that there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the village apart from the villagers defending themselves.  According to the Haganah observer Pa'il, the Irgun/Lehi forces suffered a lot of casualties because they were incompetent soldiers.  When they ran into trouble securing the central part of the village, a small group  of Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty. Begin's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of the major inaccuracies (to use a kind word) in his account.  Incidentally, \\\"three times as heavy\\\" may be correct, as there is serious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives than to the oft-quoted 250 lives.  However, note that Begin compares wounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number of wounded Arabs.  Guess why.   As is thoroughly established by many sources, the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a usueful warning.   It is worth noting how Begin disputes the standard myth that the Palestinian Arabs fled as part of a calculated plan.   Apparently 90% of Israeli historians are Jew-haters.   I have previously posted quotations by Irgun participants that totally destroys Begin's whitewash.  I have no particular desire to post it yet again.\",\"[..]  This statement simply amazes me!  \\\"Through no fault of ATF, the element of   surprise was lost\\\"!  What element of surprise?

At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war, that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It's like they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was \\\"nice and clean\\\" (smart missiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead, dying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!   [ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]                             ^^^^^^^^^  I should have said here \\\"militarily justified\\\".  It seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning \\\"morally justified\\\". I apologize.   I have often wondered about this.  I've always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk.  A good, inpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could've been held back for use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.  Yes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately, the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's ulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.   I don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the  circumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the suffering caused by those decisions.    [...]   Actually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US and allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other back-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene.  Not that we don't care, but we can't be the world's policman.  Or if a coup had occured in Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to Saudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil  interests, caused us to take action.   [...]  I'm not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the war, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep Kuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.  Well, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler would lead their nation to.   They suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much? The world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable, but that's The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.  [...]  Probably because we're not the saviors of the world.  We can't police each and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or some other places.  Tell me how we could stop them and I'll support it.  I, for one, do not agree with the present US policy of \\\"sucking up to them\\\" as you put it. I agree that it is deplorable.   Are they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order.)  I'm not an expert on California law, or even US law, but it seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize the system, but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial  prejudice thrown around.   No, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.   Germans, perhaps.  \\\"Peers\\\" doesn't mean \\\"those who do the same thing\\\", like having murderers judge murderers.  It means \\\"having people from the same station in life\\\", presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendent's motivation(s).   OK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your* logical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.  The media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing liberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)  BTW, I never used the word \\\"conspiracy\\\".  I don't accept (without *far* more evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.   Hardly.  I didn't say that it's a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people if the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn't say it is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.   I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering.  I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved. And perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  That doesn't mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as being necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it.  But don't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I don't!  I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances.   You certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist. I, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.   Wrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply refuse to condemn them for their decision.  One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action; even this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of that, and I am prepared to do so.  I don't believe that you can make the same claim.   And BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being  \\\"so deplorable\\\".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War, precision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted *in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians (proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing in WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some civilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories of \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk. Yes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But  we are expected to swallow that \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of  *civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with  the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!   What hogwash.  If \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi civilians died,  it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to  the Allied bombing.

It also means the odometer is just as easy (or hard) to change as any other mechanical odometer.

Genesis 15:6, \\\"And he (Abram) believed the LORD; and He reckoned    it to him as righteousness\\\".     I don't find anywhere that God restricts heaven to particular    ethnic groups or religious denominations or any other category    that we humans like to drop people into. But He does REQUIRE    that we believe and trust Him. In Hebrews it says that God spoke    of old by the prophets (the old testament), but in these last days    he has spoken to us by His son Jesus Christ. And we learn of    Him through the pages of the New Testament. The Bible tells us    what we need to believe. For those who have never heard, I leave    them in God's capable care, He will make himself known as he    desires. It behooves each one of us to act upon the knowledge    we have. If you reject the claims of Jesus, and still go to    heaven, then the joke's on me. If you reject him and go to hell,    that's no joke, but it will be final.

The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them. They certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true position.   The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question. The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914 and David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.     The system is meant to be slow to react, the problem is that it ended up a bit too slow.    The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate. Until Bush abused it in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent of being a check on unreasonable legislation. The veto was clearly regarded  as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive.\",\"Note:  This file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.      ---------------------------------------------------                           THE WHITE HOUSE                    Office of the Press Secretary  _________________________________________________________________  For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993                   STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY   The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?\",\"Has anyone had any experience with a replacement comm driver for windows called TurboComm.

What    follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.     [Reproduced without permission]      The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,  where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under  the tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,  presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if  a person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group  of 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and  sugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after  drinking the artificially sweetened beverage.     The study received widespread media attention and stirred a  good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.  However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers  did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did  actually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not  necessarily go hand in hand.     In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining  the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.  And after reviewing every one of them, the director of the  Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins  University, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-  sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in  the amount of food eaten afterward.      One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing  cancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a  host of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government  has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing  everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.  Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and  after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm  that it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the  Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with  monitoring public health), the American Medical Association's  Council on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration  have given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a  clean bill of health.     Granted, the FDA has set forth an \\\"acceptable daily intake\\\" of  50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed  the limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take  in 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of  aspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,  or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...  A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams  of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups  of yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content  of selected foods omitted]     Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away  from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called  phenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000  to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential  amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child  consumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause  such severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with  PKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other  aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \\\"Phenylketonurics:  Contains Phenylalanine.\\\" \",\" If you agree that good works have a role somewhere, you will  generally find yourself in one of two camps:      (1) Faith + Works --> Salvation or (2) Faith --> Salvation + Works  Either (1) works are required for salvation, or (2) faith will  inevitably result in good works.   I am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone, based on Ephesians 2 and Romans 3:21-31.  I also conclude that James 2, when  read in context, is teaching bullet (2) above. When James speaks of  justification, I would claim that he is not speaking of God declaring the believing sinner innocent in His sight (Paul's use of the word).  Instead he is speaking of the sinner's profession of faith being  \\\"justified\\\" or \\\"proven\\\" by the display of good works. Also according  to James 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a \\\"dead\\\" or  \\\"useless\\\" faith which fails to save.  James 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it is teaching (2).  Works would have their place, not as merit toward  salvation, but as evidence of true faith.

Now I'd like to describe it in detail:  The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere.  This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used. The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold internationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!! How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?  I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear) is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not analytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things complicated. Please give me a hint.  I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not. However, so many people involved in the problem \\\"sphere from 4 poits\\\". Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?

In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This  completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2  could do, since context was unknown to it.

That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't  have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get   (RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.  The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is significant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the fit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to  the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark, Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to  add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.  It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it could just be Ozzie.  The results:                             RBI-HR          Years        Actual   Predicted Carter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6 Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6 Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8 Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6  I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.

Around a million Americans every year defend themselves with firearms.  In many of these cases the defender doesn't even have to fire a shot!  The mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the deterrent that is needed.  I don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  But, taking away the right of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent crime problem in this country.  If honest, law-abiding citizens are unable to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will be able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling guns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns should be banned by the Klintonistas.   Statistics, por favor?   See my previous post.  That ought to set you straight.   People have the right to keep and bear arms no matter what the Constitution says.  That means that even if the 2nd Amendment is repealed the *people* (that's all American citizens FYI) will *still* have the right to keep and bear arms.

Again from my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}: Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some   specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller   specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a  SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2  which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it   needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be   very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst   {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and  reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between  SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.  IBM HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: [...] IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.  So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES  the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can. The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}\",\"A fine 26 year history came to a close tonight, as the Minnesota North Stars,  or Norm's Stars (whichever you prefer) lost to the Red Wings by a score of 5-3.

One is, \\\"We want you to support this Constitution, so we'll say anything that we think will appeal to you,\\\" or the more straightforward, \\\"This is why we think what we've suggested in this Constitution is a good idea.\\\"         You clearly consider the former to be the primary situation.          Well, I know Hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist, and  probably the authoritarian extreme to Jefferson's democratic impules. But what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions on the government if we don't consider what they wrote about the government?         And is writing in support of something automatically \\\"propoganda\\\" to the point we must assume it is untrue or that they are saying what they don't believe?          If the Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords, than we'd almost have to state that the House of Representatives was also. (In fact, they both were, because the British government had much greater power than did the American system).                 I disagree.  The system is not too slow, it was simply designed to handle less than it has demanded that it handle.  As somebody in Washington put it (whose name I forget), \\\"Congress has become everybody's city council.\\\"         Congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than enough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy.         It is not a case of the system of government they created failing, but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically wanted to avoid.  Namely, a concentration of power.  It would seem then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either House in some attempt to grease the wheels.  All you'll get then is a system which moves quicker to do stupid things.  It would make more sense to make more decisions at a local level.          Please explain to me how Bush abused the veto in an \\\"extraordinary\\\" manner.          I fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were placed on the veto.  It could just as easily have been read as a means to put a check on democratically popular but unwise (in the executive's opinion) policies.           There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto power regarding what a bill is for.  Previous Presidents have used the veto for any number of reasons, most usually having something to do with their agenda.  I am really curious how you single Bush out as *the* President who abused vetos.          Why is it not a reasonable restriction?  Because 51 Senators is the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based?  If 41 Senators feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and  fillibuster isn't that *enough* to indicate there's a sufficient question as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re-evaluate it?         Why one earth *should* 51% be sufficient to enact a law which covers 250 million people in very, very diverse places and living in radically different conditions?  Why *shouldn't* a super-majority be required?         Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power to ignore the minority then the minority *will* be ignored.  I do not see this as a positive thing.

But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only \\\"real solution\\\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the \\\"internal nerves\\\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that \\\"force\\\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\",\"ri    I do agree with you, in a way.

However, on a more serious note, I do believe that we should take some money  away from the foriegn operations in South America and costly border  interdiction efforts.  (Don't think I'm going to say, \\\"spend it to educate  people\\\", because I know plenty of educated dopers).  Actually, spend it on   things like drug treatment programs.

However, legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be  bought like cigarettes is just plain silly.  Plus, I have never heard of a  recommended dosage for drugs like crack, ecstasy, chrystal meth and LSD.

Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?  2) Science cannot explain origins.  This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends on what origins we are talking about.  3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science.  Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \\\"higher truth\\\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \\\"higher\\\" or  \\\"lower\\\"; they are simply true.  More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the scope of discussion.  4) This is a false premise.  If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.  5) By the way, I enjoy science.  On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read. However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy, perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.  6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.  Let us not quibble; count this one as true.  7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]  Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification:  \\\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\\\"  -----  It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.\",\" The quality of autobahns is something of a myth.

One solution, due to Derek Ho: when the popup is popped up, we SetValue its location -- which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the previous popup. The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue first, and only using SetValue if the required location is different. The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the location of the popup, so that the SetValue really does change the location of the popup.

President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President  Clinton in a question and answer session with the press:  1:36 P.M. EDT       THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk. Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day standoff ensued.       The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably insane.       He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover, responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound.       This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully. The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender.       I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision.       Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy. Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued.       Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been dne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people.       I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances.       Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now.       Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, after 51 days, you decided --       Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with --       THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go first and then the other.       Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --       Q  Mr. President --       THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I can't do it at once.       Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?       THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.       I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials. There were no shots coming back from the government side.       I asked a number of questions.  The first question I asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons I was given were the following:       Number one, that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be needed in other parts of the country.       Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out.       Number three, that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with the passage of time.       And number four, that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions.       So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time. The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time.       The third question I asked was, has the military been consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance.       Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that today.       Q  Mr. President --       THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.       Q  Can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?       THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold.       There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday. I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control.       I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves.  (Applause.)       I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the children.       But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for that.  So that is where I think things stand.       Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really decide that way?       THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we should have known?  Is there some other question they should have asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have.       There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves.       Q  Mr. President, were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from February 28th until yesterday?       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all along the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go back -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good job of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of the other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the authorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward.       Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves. That's what they thought.       Q  Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks?       Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that?       THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do whatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully cooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country.\",\"  When I owned an SE, I replaced the fan with SE Silencer, available, I believe, from MacWarehouse or MacConnection.

But these were miracles of our parent's doing.  For a decade and more the pundits have told us - \\\"you've lost it!\\\"  The \\\"me\\\" generation is only living on the accomplishments of the past.       You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living history they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell of it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as General Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle - to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.       What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand dollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only of that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen. Schriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the best new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and Poseidon ballistic missiles.       Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing.  This event is proof.  To our technological parents: We've listened to your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit.  And we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus behind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest engineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your insight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated into today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.       You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - a single stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You advocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are all great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You convinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld its components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a prime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the generation before you - the generation that built transcontinental aviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a little and Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who started this program for the SDI.       Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't even start with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a little - even sold a little and made a little money - before they moved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or more before putting the first \\\"rubber on the road.\\\"  Max Hunter - you didn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going to take ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable aerospace transportation is real.       We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same team here today but a few years to show through the Strategic Defense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us - launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about a year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet Union.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored the importance of our work in bringing about a new international relationship.       But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the next generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.       We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three years a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space rapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And yes - we'll make a little money off it too!       Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of space will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries.  What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to counter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars!       To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to the final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't Saturn V's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital system - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the way.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket exhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the world again - we must do it one brick at a time.

And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.  For example, I recently was asking some children the question \\\"What temperature does water boil at?\\\"  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked if they knew what scale, and was told \\\"It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale. That's what all thermometers say.\\\"  Well, that's sincere, and may be true in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT an absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should nurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion easily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of  the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.   [example of head-covering in Church deleted]  This was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the writing, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere. The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having a LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I  see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.    Even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally. I've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse \\\"blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks\\\" literally.  The Bible was not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way.     I agree.  Very few.  And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be  able to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another. The presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since I know I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.  I can't prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience. I also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite. Therefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them.   I can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which God is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE absolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell. Who cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as  well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they live on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on  how I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that cafeteria for lunch?  No.    This attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true, wonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an inner reflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.  NOTE:  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That'd be silly.        There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.        Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.        Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,        and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.        Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few         adults respond to this treatment.

Our people will continue to fuel the torch  of the revolution with rivers of blood until the whole of the  occupied homeland is liberated...''  --- Yasser Arafat, AP, 3/12/79   So, Ahmed is right.  There was nothing about driving Jews into the sea, just a bit of \\\"ethnic cleansing,\\\" and a river of blood.   Is this an improvement?  Adam   Adam Shostack            adam@das.harvard.edu\",\" The documentary interviewed Koresh and current and ex-members.   The documentary disucussed Koresh's \\\"Christ\\\" status inside the cult,  cult brain-washing techniques, and unusual sex practices (the leader  gets any he wants, and tells others when they can or can't).  I will let  others decide if using religious authority to have sex with a minor is  technically child abuse or not.   All true.   Well, if a fire was deliberately set by members of the cult, then the  history and background of the cult is very relevant.  The history  and backgournd of the Jones cult was very important in understanding  what happened at Jonestown.  Not taking into account the history and background of Koresh's cult may  also help explain why the FBI and BATF so badly predicted the reponses  they would get from inside the compund nearly every step of the way in  this badly handled affair.   It is likely that there will be at least two investigations (JD and congress)  at this point.   Interesting and conflicting details are starting to come out.  I have  reverted back to wait mode to find out whether the fire was intentional  or accidental and how it started and why it spread so fast.   \",\"I'm getting a sad Mac icon on a black screen with the error code 0300FF.

If it is only used for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file encryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced standard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to easy-to-break inverters.  Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap. Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e-mail and files, let's focus on this.  One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.  Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal less threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no secure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a \\\"goat\\\" can eavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones.  -------  Reading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese security services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.  Most legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to have a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of depositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable escrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the week, and that system has worked pretty well.  From my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that need to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in return we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly skilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be checked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have to be, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries, while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.  ------  In discussing this, let's try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and noise of some previous threads. This is a substantive and technical issue, and personal remarks have no place in such a discussion. \",\" Never had any problem with mine...

Seems that most of the body is metric, most of the engine is SAE).  \",\" I hope there is something I don't understand about this system, but can someone tell me how these chips are going to be manufactured while maintaining each half key under total control of the separate escrow agencies? Don't both halfs of the key have to come together (in some form) at the time the chip is constructed?  Or is it built like a fusable prom, with the chip being sent to the 1st escrow agency to program its 1/2 key, then the 2nd agency to program its 1/2 key (but who invents the safeguards that prevent the 2nd agency from reading the information already programmed by the 1st)?  This isn't intended to be a flame or anything, I am just really curious how to manufacture these things while still maintaining the key escrow security without simply saying \\\"trust the manufacturer, they won't look\\\".\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: From Israeli press.

Ha'aretz, 15 March 1993:  Yehoshua Matza (Likud), Chair of the Knesset Interior Committee, stated that he intends to demand that the police department make it clear to the public that anyone who wounds or kills [non-Jewish] terrorists will not be put on trial.

The gates will aid in the searching of [non-Jewish] Gaza residents as they leave for work in Israel.

But I seem to have no control over the length of this field. In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters, in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by  PANEL_MAX_VALUE!   As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h> contains the following bit:   /* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,   * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes   */  PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL = PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,    152),  PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH = PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,   182),  which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders. But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and return value 0.  Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me, and clear this problem?  Any help is very much appreciated.  Yuri\",\"    You have done no such thing.    An Islamic bank is a bank which operates according to the rules of Islam in regard to banking. This is done explicitly by the bank. This was not the case with BCCI.   This is crap. BCCI was motivated by the same motives as other international banks, with perhaps an emphasis on dealing with outlaws and the intelligence services of various governments.   Back to childish propaganda again. You really ought to get a life rather than wasting bandwith on such empty typing. There are thousands of Islamic banks operating throughout the world which no-one ever hears about. If you want to talk about corrupted banks we can talk about all the people who've been robbed by American banks.  \",\"     A neutral organization would report on the situation in Israel, where the elderly and children are the victims of stabbings by Hamas \\\"activists.\\\"  A neutral organization might also report that Israeli arabs have full civil rights.

Most library's have it in the reference section.    * SLMR 2.1 * If ignorance is bliss, why aren't there more happy folk?  \",\"  \",\"  I will answer this as I find time.   Notice what I said about this book.  I called it \\\"Easy reading.\\\"  The reason I dropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical Simon's.  I don't know how many walking encyclopedia's I ran across in philosphy classes.  The problem isn't in knowing sooooo much more than your average lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it.  Schaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was writting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was to simple.  I've talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I've been in lectures with the man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof's from secular as well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories)  His answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back and caused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at different open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well, simplistic.  It certainly isn't grad level reading.  But we must get off our high horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most people would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to say about this secular scientist at another time.  Also, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent* inquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt base.    Look, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must add a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in keeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know its limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust it of all value!  THis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic.  It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian faith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we fly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic lesson of life:   \\\"More without limits is less;  less with limits is more.\\\"    Or as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o freedom.  Let's put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to absurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the difference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity's contention with rationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very little else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust go hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called to go on by itself without his understanding.  This is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the Christian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment and say, \\\"Father I do not understand you but I trust you.\\\"  Now don't read all your objections of me into that statement.  I wasn't saying I do not understand you at all, but I trust you anyway.\\\" It means that \\\"I do not understand You *in this situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway\\\"  Therefore I can trust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery unrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is a statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of Faith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is not a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know why, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all the difference.  Now, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted company with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit more difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith like the insistent \\\"whying\\\" of a 3 year old.  It isn't just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot know.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other leads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in coming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after coming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need to know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp that, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may count decisevely against what we are able to trust.    If, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust him in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian leaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which allows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be ambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to us, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity. And that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in practice.   \",\"Anyone familiar with this video card? What chipset does the winjet use - S3?

Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces, I'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from one screen.   I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (within driving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if you don't live near here. Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxes for the monitors, but I'm confident that my few months of full-time service in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and flip it in your direction.

It's a great monitor, in great shape, but I'm going to a bigger screen, and although I'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it.   Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - not including shipping), will sell for **$475** (plus shipping). Again, make an offer if that sounds unreasonable.

Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 meg SIMMS).   Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking **$525** (shipping included this time, it's just a card). Original box and packaging. I'd actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this card together, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a \\\"bundled offer\\\" for these items.   ------------   Cheers.   dan keldsen - djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu \",\" Read it again yourself, then re-apply the admonition you gave to the previous poster to yourself, as well.  The first clause is not a condition, it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS, MILITIA OR NOT, that the people have a right to keep and bear arms.  This is NOT a right granted by the Constitution, it is a right presumed to exist by default.  The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the government from removing that right by stating very clearly the government shall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right.  Remember the Constitution is a bunch of negative things - things the government CANNOT do.  All rights, etc not epxressly given to the government go to the states and the PEOPLE (the same people the other 9 Amendments in the Bill of Rights talk about).  Since I am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation, I am appending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself (and you, I suspect).  I am sure you will find his qualifications adequate. If that isn't enough I can send you the Senate Subcommitee to the Judiciary on the Constitution report on the same thing...  There are some things in there that Big Brother types, like Biden, etc must have really had to swallow hard to admit.  I think you will find that people that seriously study the Constitution and state what it means will say the same thing.  Those who come up with 'new improved meanings' are those who are trying to subvert the Constitution for a given agenda.  Like Clinton and his Clinton Cripple, Gun Control, People Control, and Control Control, and the whole nasty mess.  Please tell us how this person is in error, won't you?

NOTE:  Followups set to talk.politics.guns  --------- Begin included article -------     THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT           by J. Neil Schulman  If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan, right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call would be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call if you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?  That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr. Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of \\\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\\\"  A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's expertise.  Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at USC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for \\\"Editor and Publisher\\\", a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field.  He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's fifth book on usage, \\\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\\\" has been in continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.  That sounds like an expert to me.  After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent the following letter:  \\\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.  \\\"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further, since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under oath to support, if necessary.\\\"  My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment, then concluded:  \\\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment. While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\\\"  After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political subject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity):  [Copperud:] \\\"The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a clause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb 'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia.  \\\"In reply to your numbered questions:  [Schulman:] \\\"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringed'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed' null and void?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,' 'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200 years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \\\"Since a well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'  [Schulman:] \\\"As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second Amendment to the following sentence,  \\\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,  \\\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?; and  \\\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure.  \\\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation.\\\"  Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his cover letter: \\\"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach any conclusion.\\\"  So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.  As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.  And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely. American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms, guaranteed by the Constitution.  And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.  it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?  Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution of the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits  for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.   The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed  unsafe under federal air quality laws.        \\\"People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to  exacerbate that inflammation,\\\" said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental  Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  \\\"When people are on  the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over  the edge.\\\"       The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits  with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter  of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because  they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of  compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10  exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.        In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at  levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30  microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with  asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.        The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory  Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung  Association's medical section.        The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that  particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study  by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles  may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.   Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms  and bronchitis in children.        \\\"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\\\"  says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"But more and more research is showing that particles are  bad actors as well.\\\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate  air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated  pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex  and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  acid aerosols.        \\\"Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects  of particulate air pollution,\\\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"We have no way of  duplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \\\" Consequently, most of what  is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research  like the Seattle study.        Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur  dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any  time soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with  asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.      \\\"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only  cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's  rarely particulate matter,\\\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \\\"However, PM10 doesn't have  to be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\\\"                                HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993                 NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma  The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on  Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in  dermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance  techniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care  professionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological  characteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management,  and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi  and their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in  preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days of  presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel  weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement.    Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a  distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins;  (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential  for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical  excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and  extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4)  patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high  risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely;  (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for  melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education  and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality  from melanoma.

Within the program, there are four types  of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily  in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on  clinical research; \\\"comprehensive\\\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a  multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community  outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer  prevention and control research.    Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was  the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new  cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage  of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened  the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and  cancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew  progressively.    In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today,  there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria  for comprehensive status.    To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an  institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly  established in 1990, the eight criteria for \\\"comprehensiveness\\\" include the  requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in  several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong  program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings  into clinical practice.    Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly  beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also  referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting  the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass  strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials,  significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important  outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of  sources.    The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and  capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit  important new findings or address timely research questions.

These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers  engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators  and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications  from new discoveries in the laboratory.    Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and  clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently  incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their  overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today.    Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely  structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and  control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health  departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention  and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions  responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.   Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with  institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community  hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.    Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward  creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through  interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the  laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

Specifically, we are interested in establishing this site as a clearinghouse  for personally developed software that has been developed for local medical  education programs.  We welcome all contributions that may be shared with  other users.    To connect to the UCI Medical Education Software Repository, ftp to:                        FTP.UCI.EDU  The Repository currently offers both MSDOS and Macintosh software, and we hope  to support other operating systems (UNIX, MUMPS, AMIGA?).    Uploads are welcome.  We actively solicit information and software which you  have personaly developed or have found useful in your local medical education  efforts, either as an instructor or student.    Once you have connected to the site via FTP, cd (change directory) to either  the med-ed/mac/incoming or the med-ed/msdos/incoming directories, change the  mode to binary and \\\"send\\\" or \\\"put\\\" your files.  Note that you won't be able to  see the files with the \\\"ls\\\" or \\\"dir\\\" commands.  Please compress your files as  appropriate to the operating system (ZIP for MSDOS; Compactor or something  similar for Macintosh) to save disk space.    After uploading, please send email to Steve Clancy (slclancy@uci.edu) (for  MSDOS) or Albert Saisho (saisho@uci.edu) (for MAC) describing the file(s) you  have uploaded and any other information we might need to describe it.  Note that we can only accept software or information that has been designated  as shareware, public-domain or that may otherwise be distributed freely.   Please do not upload commercial software!  Doing so may jeopardize the  existence of this FTP site.    If you wish to upload software for other operating systems, please contact  either Steve Clancy, M.L.S. or Albert Saisho, M.D. at the addresses above.

The  decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to  test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of  Health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and   Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the  therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies  including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH  that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is  intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the   replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's  reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the  MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.   \\\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the  next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\\\" said Shalala.    Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine  Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had  convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested  simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of  multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two  years.  ==================================================================       HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  \\\"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV\\\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol.  114, No. 14, P. 18        AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was  approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome,  the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the  drug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that  although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk  of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit   disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of  the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the  drug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S.  researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials,  many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients  experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of   AIDS symptoms.

In the United States, I generally read the NYT, and occasionally, a mainstream Israeli newpaper.   What you may not be taking into account is that the JP is no longer representative of the mainstream in Israel.  It was purchased a few years ago and in the battle for control, most of the liberal and left-wing reporters walked out.  The new owner stated in the past, more than once, that the JP's task should be geared towards explaining and promoting Israel's position, more than attacking the gov't (Likud at the time).  The paper that I would recommend reading, being middle stream and factual is \\\"Ha-Aretz\\\" - or at least this was the case two years ago.

EDT                     Q   For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike  Whitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh  International Airport and with me is the President of the United  States Bill Clinton.              And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.              THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.              Q   There are a lot of things we'd like to talk  about in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just  breaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been  kind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in  the trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard  that two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and  Officer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been  found not guilty.              It's a situation that's been building for over a  year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.   And I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see  the situation in Los Angeles in connection with your  administration and what you're trying to do.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the  American people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a  tribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the  efforts of the federal government in developing the case.              The law under which the officers were tried is a  complex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury  decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible  for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did  most of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked  Rodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some  blows, and another officer who was a rookie.              No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but  it appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They  acknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think  that the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But  I hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:   first of all, the importance of trying to bring this country  together and not violate the civil rights of any American;  secondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.                I think it's important to recognize that in the  poorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this  country, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're  even more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our  efforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police  officers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a  waiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some  other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to  violence and drugs.              And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to  me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic  revitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed  areas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles  who wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many  problems as we do.                And I laid out a very ambitious program in the  campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment  to bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary,  Ron Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies  for that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest  unemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the  country.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to  the new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several  other people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with  regard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.              Q   Let's talk about what brings you to the  Pittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a  lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.   You've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you  said earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break  that gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to  Allegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that  battle?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First  of all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported  me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in  economic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it  gives the country a very different budget for the next five years  than we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and,  at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and  health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.              But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the  short run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money  to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half;  to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also  to try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The  plan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the  Senate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a  bloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come  to a vote.              I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote  for the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican  leader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to  stay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases  the deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending  targets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for  this year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five  years.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the  economy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that  are holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for  billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind -- much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.              So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.   I've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I  think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work  right now to show that we're changing the direction of the  country.  And that's the purpose of the bill.              Q   Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or  his office lately?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk  regularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison  operation to the senators that we think are open to this -- Senator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords  from Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six  others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and  know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life  of the budget I presented.              You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've  got a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth  is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life  of the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we  have this program well below the spending targets that Congress  has already approved for this year.  And they've done this for  years, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans  voting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as  putting the American people back to work.                So I just hope that this doesn't become a political  issue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and  the need for jobs.              Q   I have some questions from people who supported  you, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.   It has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot  of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I  think some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the  White House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go  through.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And  they're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull  it off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew  it was going to be like this.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask  people, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving  very fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the  fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in  history, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we  are moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on  political reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole  wide range of things.                But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn  it around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions  which led to the victory I received from the people in November,  and we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making  real, real progress.                I would urge the people not to get discouraged.   We're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going  to happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing  things.              Q   Thank you very much.

The technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as I understand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.  Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule today.  But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain cellular calls and then ask a judge, \\\"Hey, can we have permission to listen to those tapes?\\\" can they?   Yes, that is a major concern, but I think that they think they can win just by having 99.5% of the USA use this system.  They don't even have to care about the cautious .5% that's left.  They don't catch the really smart crooks anyway.

Basically get the eci-freaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth.. You think this is crazy. Well in a way it is, but in a way it is reality.  There is a billin the congress to do just that.. Basically to make it so expensive to mine minerals in the US, unless you can by off the inspectors or tax collectors.. ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends  of mine, that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income of the mine, versus the adjusted income, also the state governments have there normal taxes. So by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, and other expenses you can owe more than what you made. BAsically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses, you can owe 600.00 in federal taxes.. Bascially it is driving the miners off the land..

This of course, is foolish.  Should a mass murderer, a pedophile, a 10-year old pyromaniac have a \\\"positive view\\\" of themselves?  Of course not.  A person that engages in behaviour that a large number of people condemn, and IF you believe in the concept of \\\"society\\\", then your only choice is to expect that person to have a negative view of themselves.   --  There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of environmental disaster.

I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such \\\"storys\\\" about them. OK ? Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:    -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.          It has an hightech \\\"boiler\\\" but the rest is still verry verry           conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-          powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.          If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find          a chapter about the \\\"CARNOT-process\\\" which describes how to          get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason          for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an          temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one           side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water          again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the           energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to          let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \\\"cold\\\"          steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.          And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of          energy that carnot will give them.          The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !          The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,          because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in          AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent          radioactive pollution of the environment !              -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-          Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still          verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere          around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with          the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the          metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.          This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures          up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.      -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever          possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the          years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem          at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have          1.5 mRem.

I want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap once I start running out of allocatable cells, using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color.  Once I determine if a cell is read-only, I assume I can then just request an XAllocColor() with the exact same color specifications and it will  then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another application.  So far, the only way I've figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors, once my colormap is all full up.  It should error out if the cell is non-shareable. But life would be much easier if I could just detect the read-only/shareable stuff directly...

The idea I've gotten is that to christians, Hell is -- like Heaven --  afterlife; i.e, you don't cease to exist, but are subjected to eternal   torture (well, that's the orthodox idea anyway; \\\"eternal death\\\" if you  prefer that). Atheists don't believe in any sort of afterlife.    I think it's safe to say that Hell was never intended metaphorical. Certainly  not the equivalent of ceasing to exist. Some christian concepts are indeed  metaphors, but your idea of Hell is a 20th century interpretation. It is, of  course, nice to see that even christianity might evolve to fit the worldview   of modern age, but I fear the church will not accept it. Understandably, per-  haps, because if you accept that Hell is a metaphor, then you're one step  closer to turning God into a metaphor as well.\",\"Does anyone have a version of \\\"Which Mac Do I Buy?\\\" that is later than v 1.3.1?

The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the Holocaust is a myth, archivists say.  \\\"The notes give them their authenticity,\\\" said Robert Wolfe, a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  \\\"He was supposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his own rules.\\\"  The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.  Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than 100 German secret police generals.  \\\"I also want to talk to you, quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly. I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish race.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been written and is never to be written.\\\"  [Emphasis mine--rje]  The German word Himmler uses that is translated as \\\"extermination\\\" is *Ausrottung*.  Wolfe said a more precise translation would be \\\"extirpation\\\" or \\\"tearing up by the roots.\\\"  In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism, \\\"Judenevakuierung\\\" or \\\"evacuation of the Jews.\\\"  But archives officials said \\\"extermination\\\" is the word he actually spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.  Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's \\\"final solution of the Jewish question,\\\" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.  The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum here on April 26.  The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of Himmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.   ---From p.A10 of Saturday's L.A.

I always wanted to build my own but never have the time to fool around and design it.  pin 1:  signal ground pin 2:  signal pin 3:  always hot +6 volts pin 4:  +6 volts, hot only when preamp is turned on pin 5:  infrared repeater connectors  The infrared repeater jacks on the back of the preamp are not connected to anything inside the preamp except the 5 pin connector pin #5.  There is a 150 ohm resistor between the two jacks, with a 1.5K from pin 5 to ground.  The signal pin #2 in the preamp is summed with the built in IR receiver. They use a chip called CX20106A and a BJT to amplify the signal.  I would imagine the logical way would be to duplicate this circuit and use it as the external receiver.

I can't help but wonder what would happen if all violence against Israelis stopped.  Hopefully, violence against Arabs would stop at the same time.  If a state of non-violence could be  maintained, perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved, i.e., greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the \\\"territories\\\".    Of course, given the current leadership of Israel, your way may work also - but if that leadership changes, e.g., to someone with Ariel Sharon's mentality, then I would predict a considerable loss of life, i.e., no winners.  Secondly, regarding your comment about the U.S. troops responding to \\\"stiff resistance\\\" - the analogy is not quite valid.  The U.S. troops could get out of the neighborhood altogether.  The Israelis could not.  Just my $.02 worth, no offense intended.
