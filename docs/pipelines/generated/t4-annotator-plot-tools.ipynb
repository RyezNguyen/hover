Unless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys from men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex (due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the children from abuse by members of the *same* sex.  If we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest that if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a practical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations in which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse them. By working together \\\"with good will on both sides\\\", we may be able to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.  Mr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for personal attacks on Mr. Cramer.

I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just been released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed several monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the Nanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last year.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing criteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I scored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it scored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.  Incidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading reviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the criteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product testing was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly know what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the ranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet your needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of what we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply more closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you don't also understand the scoring.\",\"I live at sea-level, and am called-upon to travel to high-altitude cities quite frequently, on business.

For our class project, we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs:  Voltatge:  adjustable from 1-12V Current:   *limited* at 1A  Voltage must stay within 2% of designated value for I from 0-1A AC ripple less than 5 mV (rms)  Of course, we can't just use an adjustable voltage, current-limiting regulator chip ;^)  Our problem is with the current limiting (i.e. we've found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit).  What the supply must do, if presented with a load which would draw more than 1A, given the supply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp.  Thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we should read one amp.  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm  resistor at 12V, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by necessity, must be 1V.  The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output  power transistor, and therefore reduce the output.  So, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?  Thanks in advance.

Further, the early church bears testimony to the impact.   Of course they knew where it was. Don't forget that Jesus was seen by both the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker. Pilate was no fool and didn't  need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus' body to  make it appear He had arisen. Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a  man well know to the Sanhedrin, to say that they didn't know where He was buried begs the question.  Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think on this a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a  deliberate lie!? If not, then why do you think the disciples would!? Now, I'm not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth,  but unbeknown to you, it is a lie. Many have done this. No, I'm talking about dying, by beheading, stoning, crucifixion, etc., for something you know to be a lie! Thus, you position with regards to the disciples stealing the  body seems rather lightweight to me.  As for graverobbers, why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over  the body of Jesus? He wasn't buried with great riches. So, again, this is an argument that can be discounted.  That leaves you back on square one. What happened to the body!?

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?\",\"                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Wow!

There are lots of them!\",\" I think one (not ideal) solution is to use the tracing utility (can't remember the name, sorry!) included in the Corel Draw s/w pack.  It can convert bitmaps to Corel art format.  These can then be imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap. Result - the file is completely in Corel format and can be SCODAL'ed no problem!  BUT the slight problem with this, which makes the solution less than idea, is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments.  So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to image.  The obvious solution is time-consuming - stripping out the extra points by hand using Corel.  OUCH! I've done it a few times :-]                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  As I say, if you don't mind the problems, go via the route...

Certainly I never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists in the employ of the NHS.  Perhaps the law codified it but the authorities refused to hire any homeopaths.  A similar law in the US allows chiropractors to practice in VA hospitals but I've never seen one there and I don't know of a single VA that has hired a chiropractor. There are a lot of Britons on the net, so someone should be able to tell us if the NHS provides homeopaths for you.   --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\": >: English cars:- : > : >: Rover, Reliant, Morgan, Bristol, Rolls Royce, etc. : >                  ^^^^^^ : >   Talk about Harleys using old technology, these : >Morgan people *really* like to use old technology.  : Well, if you want to pick on Morgan, why not attack its ash (wood) : frame or its hand-bent metal skin (just try and get a replacement :-)).   : I thought the kingpost suspension was one of the Mog's better features.

How about *this* question instead?  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a political opponent of a senior administration official and      intercepts a conversation...  Kinda changes your interpretation of the event, doesn't it?  And yes, the presence of the Clipper Chip DOES change things, because it will not only give the people talking on the phone a false sense of security, it will also give federal law enforcement agencies the justification to deny use of strong encryption methods that are inconvenient to them. Dang it all, it's SUPPOSED to be inconvenient (but not impossible). That's the ONLY sure way to make sure that abuses are minimized while still allowing legitimate law enforcement access.    Uh huh... sure.  I predict that within two months (weeks?) of the chip's debut, the full technical details will be posted to sci.crypt.  And if this has ANY impact on the security of the key escrow system, then we've been lied to.  Any cryptosystem worth its salt can withstand the light of public scrutiny, and there is NO WAY you can be sure that an algorithm has no \\\"unrecognized vulnerabilities\\\" unless you have half the world trying to break it for a decade or so.  Even then, you gotta be careful. \",\"     There's been extensive discussion on the CompuServe Cancer Forum about Dr.  Burzynski's treatment as a result of the decision of a forum member's father  to undertake his treatment for brain glioblastoma.  This disease is  universally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992, the  tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forum  member checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki's track record for this disease.   He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from  glioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had  audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive.   After the forum member's father began Dr. Burzynski's treatment in  September, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his  oncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of  shrinkage or necrosis.  The patient's oncologist, although telling him he would probably not live  past December 1992, was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynski's  treatment.  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynski's  treatment, she's since changed her attitude toward continuing these  treatments, saying \\\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\\"  Dr. Burzynski is an M.D., Ph.D. with a research background who found a  protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized it,  and administers it to patients with certain cancer types.

Otherwise we may assume that it is another piece of anti-Israel bullshit posted by someone whose family does not know how to teach their children to tell the truth.

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin   e. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.  Your perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.  Similarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.\",\"I  have one of the original Powerbook 170's (with 4Mb of Ram) and find that 4Mb is a drag when trying to do my work.

Low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz (and THESE have significant temperature drifts, which one doesn't often notice while wearing the watch on one's wrist).

Leading the first Armenian units who crossed the Ottoman  border in the company of the Russian invaders was the former Ottoman  Parliamentary representative for Erzurum, Karekin Pastirmaciyan, who  assumed the revolutionary name Armen Garo. Another former Ottoman  parliamentarian, Hamparsum Boyaciyan, led the Armenian guerrilla forces  who ravaged Turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname \\\"Murad\\\",  especially ordering that            'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in            whatever circumstances you find them.

Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a  telegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in  April 21, 1915, \\\"thanking it for its services to Russia.\\\" The Armenian  newspaper Gochnak, published in the United States, also proudly  reported in May 24, 1915 that   \\\"only 1,500 Turks remained in Van the rest having been slaughtered.\\\"  Source: Hovannisian, Richard G.: Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918.

Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

The main legal principles of the Turkish State  are summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:   \\\"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State  governed by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public  peace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;  loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental  tenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.\\\"  Freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The fact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be attributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution. The first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856. Although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force only temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.  The 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and the right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution of 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing the power of the Parliament and the government.  The First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the occupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was abolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the occupying forces.  During the Independence War, the \\\"Turkish Grand National Assembly\\\" held their first meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new Turkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish Republic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new Constitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal  backbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a  multi-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by others in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been based on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national sovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.  \\\"Major Principles of the Constitution\\\"  The constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic within the following principles:  - The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by    law; - It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,   human rights and the objectives of Ataturk; - The language of the State is Turkish; - Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.   Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation; - Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This   power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else; - Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers; - Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the   Turkish nation; - All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,   sex, or political beliefs; - Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.  \\\"Structure of the State\\\"  In accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the principle of \\\"division of power\\\" to create a balanced and self-controlled system. The power is divided into \\\"legislative power,\\\" \\\"executive power,\\\" and \\\"judicial power,\\\" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each other (self-control).   A. Legislative Power:   The \\\"Turkish Grand National Assembly\\\" is a parliament with one House, elected  by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on  behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:   - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;  - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;  - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;  - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;  - to ratify international agreements;  - to grant amnesty or pardons.   Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral  or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is  divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is  calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age  of twenty-one can vote.   Elections are supervised by the \\\"Supreme Council of Elections,\\\" which solves  all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local \\\"Board of Election\\\"  runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the  Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among   independent judges.   B. Executive Power:   The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government  as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:   - to represent the State and the Country;  - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;  - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;  - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;  - to ratify laws and government decrees.    The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven  years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may   call for a referendum.   Executive power is exercised by the \\\"Council of Ministers,\\\" headed by the  Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the  members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval  by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their  program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)  Ministers in the Council.   Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent  \\\"administrative\\\" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or  functions against any law.   C. Judicial Power:   Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can  instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be   discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the  reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories  of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:   - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The     decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice    upon the appeal of the parties involved.  - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime    Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in    administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.    The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the    high administrative court.   The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the  \\\"Constitutional Court\\\" if they contradict the Constitution. If found  contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.   Serdar Argic\",\"Well I am using The Home Office. I bought it for arounde $350. It does 14.4.

He called a total of 4 penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques. The Nords' penalty came in O.T.  Stewart, being an ex-Nordique himself, was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords get away with murder...WE WAS ROBBED!!!!  It was an excellent game with plenty of end-to-end rushes and tremendous goalkeeping.  The Nords tied it with over 1 minute to go while Lebeau was serving a penalty.  I don't mind Stewart calling a penalty in the last 5 min. of the game, but AT LEAST BE FAIR ABOUT IT.  The Nords were caught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once.  Stewart turned the other cheek...BASTARD!  Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal. He was shaky and on his knees for the rest of the night.  The winning goal shouldn't have gone in.

My current setup is a 386SX-25 (AMD) with 387SX-25 (ITT - I think) and 9 Mbytes of 70ns SIMMS, and (120+100)Mbyte IDE.

The first option works out at about \\\\pounds 200. 486 m/boards start at this price for a SX-25.

Should I get an upgradeable m/board with a 386DX-40 and wait for AMD/Pentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 ?   Any experiences will be most helpful ...    Kenny.  PS.

We think you're pretty hilarious too.  I love how you Brit's kiss royal arse.  That you're willing to throw out freedom-of-speech for the sake of protecting the reputation of the royal sluts.  That the British government advertised in American newspapers \\\"Send A Gun to Defend a British Home -- British civilians, faced with threat of invasion, desperately need arms for the defense of their homes.\\\" during WWII.

British courts have never recognized the right to assemble or to demonstrate.  That evidence obtained form coerced confessions is allowed in a trial.  That only serious felonies warrant a trial by jury.  That suspected terrorists must prove their innocence, instead of the government having to prove their guilt.  That the secretary of state may issue an \\\"exclusionary order\\\" which bars someone from ever entering a particular part of the United Kingdom, such as Northern Ireland or Wales.  That the BBC banned Paul McCartney's \\\"Give Ireland Back to the Irish\\\" as well as John Lennon's \\\"Give Peace a Chance\\\" during the Gulf War.  Yes, England is very very funny.

Also, even though most people do not ride motorcycles, they do boat, sail, jetski, climb, ski, fly parachute, hang-glide, glide, bungee-jump, bike, skate, rollerblade, skateboard, play rugby (ouch), mow the lawn, rewire the basement, operate heavy machinery,  and do a host of other 'dangerous' things that would all be as valid as motorcycling as activities to ban. Your little homily applies to all those things, and the general public buying into banning motorcycles without realizing that their activity would be next is unlikely. \",\"According to the official documentation, failure to use the IIfx terminator can not only affect SCSI bus performance but can also damage the bus. Whether this is your problem or not I don't know. I have had sporadic SCSI problems with my IIfx since I bought it. (I cannot connect more than three devices, fourth one causes major problems).  First thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system. If you continue to get errors it is probably the drive. If it formats fine then I would try to format it on your system with no externals. If this  fails then the SCSI controller on your IIfx needs repair/replacement.  Hope this helps.  \",\"        Well, lets see....I took a class on this last fall, and I have no notes so I'll try to wing it...           Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that  black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars, M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking appoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time, they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any of these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of the galaxy.           Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the various satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either Pion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our catalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic distribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of homogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE. Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I suppose you are saying, \\\"Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the disk.\\\"  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an  analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile away sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different, and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe find a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.           I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As I said before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short timescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of behavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources. When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk, but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources  in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of these characteristics.  \",\" I did say *any* invader, didn't I?

However, I think that your rules are MUCH too complicated.  How will the normal average fan be able to count how many fouls a player has?

And, of course, there will have to be new \\\"sub-positions\\\", like the power center who just sits in the slot until the (blue, of course) puck comes near him, and the \\\"shooting defenseman\\\" and the \\\"point defenseman\\\".  Finally, we'll be able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty-shot takers.

Assuming that they are using civilians for cover, are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country? If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working? Why is it  further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages? Why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone? You see, there is more to the shelling of the villages.... it is called RETALIATION... \\\"GETTING BACK\\\" ...\\\"GETTING EVEN\\\". It doesn't make sense to shell the villages. The least it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of civilians.     If Israel is not willing to accept the \\\"word\\\" of others then, IMHO, it has no business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks.    No, I am not Basil. I think Basil is a very intelligent person and I respect what he writes. Basil is a person that I would gladly call a friend. He is, however, not me. Nor am I Lebanese, as some seem to suspect.    Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. Of course, if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't make the Lebanese so mad as to do that. Furthermore, with Hezbollah  subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.   Tim, when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border? Not lately, eh?  Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use territory under their control to attack Israel. While Lebanon would be better off with Syria and Israel out of its borders, the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory (not on Israeli troops in Lebanon, however. Please note the distinction) in the past two years.   I disagree, Basil has always seemed to me to be a cool-headed person, slow to anger (certainly more so than I). What is most important is that he is an  actual witness to things from the other end of the Israeli guns. If only the  Israeli government would remember what it was like when the roles were  reversed perhaps they would moderate their \\\"retaliation\\\".\",\"Coming from a long line of \\\"hot tempered\\\" people, I know temper when I see it.

(Command-line flag is -ghbnie.)   o Explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view    window is closed, for window managers too dull to do so    themselves.   o Better visited anchor color for non-SGI's.   o Added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files.   o Added 'Clear' button to Open box, to allow more convenient    cut-n-paste entries of URL's.   o New resource 'autoPlaceWindows'; if set to False, new document    view windows will not be automatically positioned by the    program itself (but it's still up to your window manager just how    they're placed).   o Command-line flags -i and -iconic now have desired effect (new    resource initialWindowIconic can also be used).   o Gif-reading code is a little more bulletproof.   o Obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in IMG tag fixed.   o Eliminated nonintuitive error message when image can't be read    (inlined NCSA bitmap is indication enough that something's not    right for authors, and readers can't do anything about bad images    in any case).   o Obscure parsing bug (for constructs like <ADDRESS><A    HREF=...>text<A></ADDRESS>) fixed.   o Fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits Suns.   o Fixed stupid coredump on URL's like '://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/'.   o Fixed buglet in handling rlogin URL's.   o New support for Solaris/SYSVR4 (courtesy    dana@thumper.bellcore.com).   o Better support for HP-UX 8.x and 9.x (courtesy    johns@hpwarf.wal.hp.com).   o Better support for NeXT (courtesy scott@shrug.dur.ac.uk).   o Some miscellaneous portability fixes (courtesy    bingle@cs.purdue.edu).   o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups.

Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I'll give  your question a shot.   The key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really  have to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need  10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your  pages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not  toner.  But that should go without saying.  My PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little  while to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once  the computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out  every 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.    The BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I'm assuming that the DeskJet can, or  HP wouldn't sell many......  Size is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built  like a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.  Finally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200's resolution.  It looks like  a good laser quality print.  The HP's I've used.....they look like ink.  Not  as impressive.  \",\"1987 ARIENS RIDING LAWN MOWER   This mower is in perfect condition and  contains the following features:   - Electric Start  - 26 inch cut  - Double Rear Baggers  - New Battery  - New Engine (one year old)  - Inflatable Tires (gives nice ride)  - Cushioned Seat (gives nice ride)  - Tuned up and blade sharpened in the    past month   I am moving into a house that has a  small area of grass to cut and does not  require such large mower.

The issue of \\\"official doctrine\\\" is obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial (e.g. \\\"The Seven Deadly Heresies\\\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best, or erroneous at worst (\\\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation\\\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations (his book \\\"Mormon Doctrine\\\" is oftentimes referred to as \\\"McConkie's Bible\\\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books! (The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen.

Peace, matt \",\"[MODERATOR:  Nice summary, Keith, thanks.]  I talked to the federal Dept. of Justice (DOJ, Ottawa) to try and clarify a bunch of things regarding changes to Canadian gun laws. I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email, followup to t.p.g.  1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get    a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I    was told by a police officer. 2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to    protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns    must be stored locked up and unloaded, however. 3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will    be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.    The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form    authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.      Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these    'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will    be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess    them, but will not be allowed to stock them. 4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will    not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations    specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some     manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.    (God knows how much they'll charge for these)  This covers most of what we discussed.

We know that early Christians suffered totures because of their witness to Christ.  For example:  ACT 5:40    His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had             them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of             Jesus, and let them go.  ACT 5:41    The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been             counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.  It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion to even hearing Jesus's name. ACT 5:28    \\\"We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,\\\" he said.             \\\"Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are             determined to make us guilty of this man's blood.\\\"  Finally, the first apostle's death, James of Zebedee was certainly not by Rome's hand any more than the first martyr Stephen.     The problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection, then one must believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what He stood for and preached during His ministry on Earth.  That would have been extremely difficult for some people, especially those that had plotted to kill Him.   \",\"Was going over some videos last night.....  Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very interesting.  And enlightening.  Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco, circa June 1986.  1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,     not gain more bulk.  2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's     lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.  3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like     Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is     released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -     Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his     stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,     they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard     to make adjustments in your swing.  What would I do, if I were Jose?  Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch, so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.  First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance, and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move the bathead more freely.  Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.  Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength  is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park.  If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could still hit 600+ HR.  \",\"In <sfnNTrC00WBO43LRUK@andrew.cmu.edu> \\\"David R. Sacco\\\" <dsav+@andrew.cmu.edu>    Yes.

I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method.

According -> > to the Federalist Paper's, a well regulated militia has a well defined  -> > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations. ->  -> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!  Perhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the \\\"well regulated malitia.\\\"  Here is what is says about its character:    To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes   of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through   military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to   acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the   character of a well-regulated militia,   It also talks about the \\\"well regulated militia\\\" having a nationally uniform in structure and disipline.    I will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:       Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with  respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed  and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it  will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of  a year.  But, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large group of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people every year, provide a basic training to new people so they can be integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it  requires a continually standing committee of organizers.    Since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and disipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim a \\\"well regulated militia\\\" is not well organized.  But I will concide  a \\\"well organized militia\\\" is not necessarily a \\\"well regulated militia.\\\"   Several people have stated that the \\\"well organized militia\\\" is what is defined under 10 USC 311, which states   The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied   males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in   section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are,   or who have made a declaration of intention to become,   citizens of the United States and of female citizents of   the United States who are commissioned officers of the   National Guard.  This deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \\\"well regulated.\\\" 10 USC 311 does not define a \\\"well regualed militia\\\" in any way, shape,  or form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia The Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \\\"well regualed militia\\\" as a proper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it talk above \\\"disciplining all the militia of the United States\\\" so they fit the \\\"character of a well-regulated militia.\\\"  This is what the paragraph states about the associated costs:   It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor   of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the   present numbers of the people, would not fall far short   of the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all   the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the   mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,  would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not   succeed, because it would not long be endured.   Another quote provide by Charles Scripter is: James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \\\"General Welfare\\\" clause):   \\\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first  to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a  recital of particulars.\\\"  So the phrase \\\"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall  not be infringed\\\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \\\"a well  regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\\\"   The definition of \\\"explain\\\" as stated in \\\"The American Hertitage Dictionary of the Enlish Language\\\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:  1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;     elucidate: \\\"It was the economists who undertook to explain      this puzzle\\\"  2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.  3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:     explain an error The second phrase clearly does not \\\"explain\\\" the first, therefore the second phrase must \\\"qualify\\\" the first.  The definition given for \\\"qualify\\\" is:  1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities     of; characterize.  2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or      task.  3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.  4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.  5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate  6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase) Since \\\"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed\\\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and it has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task. By process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since #3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it must be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \\\"the right  of the people to keep and bear Arms\\\" gives legal power to the \\\"well  regualated militia\\\" and this legal power \\\"shall not be infringed\\\".

And, I'll note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over five years -- I'd say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8^)   *  In the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what I meant by \\\"There is no way out of the loop\\\".  I wrote that human brains \\\"are infested with sin\\\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.    Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your conscience is properly formed?  The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the formed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure that your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation can be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll grant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.  Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be certain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is `properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)   Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:   The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation? How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or another -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?  You write:   But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I am confident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way from `confident'.  This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain (really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is significantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that you are confident, that invites people to ask why.  Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely certain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any idea of his own fallibility.   I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of them -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible. The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.   Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu  [This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the original criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong answers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal consequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is at least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that -- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are fallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these basic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's unlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of confidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for example said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell, and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and intolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's some chance I'm wrong.  Don't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant Christians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least some cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger. If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for certain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I think it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that way.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most difficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell what I think is the truth.\",\" It would seem logical that the mask is Potvins.

Thanks, \",\"  : I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of : the world  if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group : of the population.   I've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties with Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority of people, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though 90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland, religious people are actually a minority.   Could it be possible that many people believe in god \\\"just in case\\\"? It seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal's Wager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn't care - it believes, but doesn't know what or how.   People don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle, they only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say that they are not \\\"born in the Spirit\\\", but this does not disturb them. Religion is not something to think about.   I'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless -  a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to. Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many people take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow (and unconsciously hope god wouldn't notice ;-) )  : Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a : higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The : typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the : same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the : other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn : somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core, : than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it : expresses its own selfishness.  If logic and reason are valued, then I would claim that atheistic thinking is of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessary assumptions they believe in - I've yet to see good reasons to believe in gods, or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do.  However, why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bears some resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematics works?

Gregg is not, as I understand his posts, giving any support to the bounty on Rushdie's life.  If that's correct, end of one point...  Gregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners don't accept. His comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him, and are even making a _little_ sense to me now - if a person is a member of a group (religion or whatever) they bind themselves to follow the ways of the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum. The big bone of contention here that I'm picking up is that in the West we have secular governments that maintain, more or less, a level of control and of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups.  I think the majority of us reading this thread are in tune (note - I didn't say \\\"in agreement\\\") with the idea that you are finally responsible to the secular government,  and within that to the group or groups a person may have chosen.  With that in mind, it not possible under secular law (\\\"legally\\\" as most people would define the term) to hold a person to a particular group once they decide to separate from it.  Only if the secular authorities agree that there is a requirement of some sort (contractual, etc) is there any secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or past group member.  A religion can, and often does, believe in and require additional duties of a group member.  And it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties in many ways - ostracism is common for example.  But the limit comes when the enforcement would impose unwanted and/or unaccepted onus on a person _in conflict with secular law_.  This is the difference.  In a theocracy, the requirements of the secular authorities are, by definition, congruent with the religious authorities. Outside a theocracy, this is not _necessarily_ true.  Religious requirements _may_ coincide or may not.  Similiarly, religious consequences _may_ or may not coincide with secular consequences (if any).

As published in \\\"US Industrial Outlook 1993\\\"  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be \\\"adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.\\\"                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  \\\"Space Business Indicators\\\" in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year  through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request \\\"launch on demand\\\"  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/\\\"Spacelifter\\\" program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all \\\"ELV upgrade\\\" programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \\\"Spacelifter\\\"  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \\\"GO-AHEAD\\\"    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a \\\"Star Wars\\\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \\\"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\\\"     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst's report Morgan Stanley said \\\"We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.\\\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \\\"Aerokosmos\\\"  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \\\"Severkosmos\\\",  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one's a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \\\"the main  alternative rocket supplier\\\" for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of \\\"off the shelf\\\" components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the  satellite's communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \\\"Asiasat- 2\\\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based \\\"Asiasat\\\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's  aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \\\"made in Korea.\\\"   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

As I said at the start  of this, column there's been a lot of interesting happenings - but  I'll have to put them into the next issue.      Looking ahead, I've got several articles in the works on new  happenings with Iridium and the LEO communications satellite market,  more news on international launchers appearing (and disappearing) on  the market, new international commercial space ventures,  and other  interesting developments.

Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xt happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered,  the specification does not guarantee such a sequence, and supplemental  authoritative documents (i.e. the Asente/Swick volume) do say that the order is undefined.  Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.  In general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating  independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other callbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be  registered can explicitly call other functions necessary.  [4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?   XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not  actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?    It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback, which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer is set to one of the valid values. If it is not a \\\"yes\\\" answer, the code drops out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop:    void quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)  {   int             answer;   answer = AskUser(w, \\\"Really Quit?\\\");   if (RET_YES == answer)    {    answer = AskUser(w, \\\"Are You Really Positive?\\\");    if (RET_YES == answer)     exit(0);                 }  }   A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether  to overwrite it.  This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the calling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the  Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of  dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for \\\"OK\\\", \\\"Cancel\\\" and  \\\"Help\\\" or equivalents:    int AskUser(w, string)         Widget          w;         char           *string;   {         int             answer=RET_NONE; /* some not-used marker */         Widget          dialog;   /* could cache&carry, but ...*/         Arg             args[3];         int             n = 0;         XtAppContext    context;          n=0;         XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,                 XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;         XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;         dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);         XtManageChild(dialog);          context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);         while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {                 XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);         }         XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */         return answer;   }   The dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same  function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user  finally selects one of those choices:    void response(w, client, call)         Widget          w;         XtPointer client;         XtPointer call;   {   int *answer = (int *) client;   XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;         switch (reason->reason) {         case XmCR_OK:                 *answer = RET_YES; /* some #define value */                 break;         case XmCR_CANCEL:                 *answer = RET_NO;    break;         case XmCR_HELP:                 *answer = RET_HELP;                 break;         default:                 return;         } }  and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and continues from there.

I have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is.   Users of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function, which  will work on both widgets and non-widget objects.   If you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do  what you want. Note that it depends on the widget's internal data structures  and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt, including R4.   #include <X11/CoreP.h>  #include <X11/Xresource.h>  String XtName (widget)  Widget widget; /* WILL work with non-widget objects */  {  return XrmNameToString(widget->core.xrm_name);  }  [7/90; modified with suggestion by Larry Rogers (larry@boris.webo.dg.com) 9/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 125)  Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindow(widget)? I'm doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics within my Xt-based program:    The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the  realization of the widget.  Using a window id of NULL (\\\"no window\\\") could  create the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget()  before attempting to use the window associated with a widget.   Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call,  but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also  wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?  The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of  the screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can take the following steps to avoid the error:  1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture. 2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle. 3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap. 4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the image from the pixmap. 5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and  the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you  the parts of the pixmap which aren't good. 6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.

A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight character-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:    display = XOpenDisplay(display_name);  if (display)   { do X stuff }  else   { do curses or something else } where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following -display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case  XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].  This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line  argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is  adequate. [5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 128)  How do I make a \\\"busy cursor\\\" while my application is computing? Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?   The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is  as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel  window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other  application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the  user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual  desktop.) Substitute \\\"toplevel\\\" with your top-most widget here (similar code  should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):       unsigned long valuemask;      XSetWindowAttributes attributes;       /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */      valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;      attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |          ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);      attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);       /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by         its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */      XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,          65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,          CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);  where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen, particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767.  When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to normal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well.  In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor  resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events.

An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which  continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its  children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X  connection to the display.   What you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process,    close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget))); to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your  exec. You will then be able to exit the parent.  Alternatively, before exec'ing make this call, which causes the file  descriptor to be closed on exec.   (void) fcntl(ConnectionNumber(XDisplay), F_SETFD, 1);  [Thanks to Janet Anstett (anstettj@tramp.Colorado.EDU), Gordon Freedman  (gjf00@duts.ccc.amdahl.com); 2/91. Greg Holmberg (holmberg@frame.com), 3/93.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 130)  Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler?   No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical  sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which  might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave the library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by  Xlib or Xt functions.  You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added.   Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly  Volume 6 are in error.  [Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse  (converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 131)  What are these \\\"Xlib sequence lost\\\" errors?   You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error  handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or  Xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?   It's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input  both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but  which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or  the other file descriptor.  A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor, use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be  called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your  program's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt  callback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only non-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.  Most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an  input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.  Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file. You will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending. XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is  called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is new data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always  ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almost always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the  type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your  function to test whether there is new data:       if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return; But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a  busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting  a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.

You can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting the window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget which should receive the event.   If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use  XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you avoid a round-trip to the server.  Depending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call its action procedures in order to get the effects you want.  [courtesy Mark A. Horstman (mh2620@sarek.sbc.com), 11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 134)  Why doesn't anything appear when I run this simple program?    You are right to map the window before drawing into it. However, the  window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen -- until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will  generally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code  would appear after window was created and mapped:   while (!done)     {       XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);       switch (the_event.type) {  case Expose:  /* On expose events, redraw */   XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);   break;  ...  }     }   Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't  set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background  colors, so this program could previously include this code:   ...   the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */   the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */   the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,                 GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);   ...   Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is  black and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1  and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be  reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.  Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong  thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for  foreground and background.  And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program if you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may not yet have appeared.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?   The 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A  server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0, unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit -- the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available  Screens on this particular Display connection.  The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.  In Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine  the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.  (Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the Screen have \\\"Display\\\" in the names --  XDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

No.  Once set, the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be  re-read by clients.  The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap, set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The  window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're  sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea()  to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read  back that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and  it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD  and Stuart Marks of Sun]   Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a  (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the  original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved.

A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly window. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have several choices:  - the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to make non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers  support the extension.  - a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note  that there is no X notion of a \\\"transparent color index\\\".  - a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny  windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.  - a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly.

However, the drawing operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black and White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break.]  If you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be  allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre-computed values.  If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you  can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics  context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over  red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red.  This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and  blue.

Make sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red, green, and blue  fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is  full-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color)  the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is  usually black.

Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.

The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there  -- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using XFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever  color you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a  mask).

My program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it.   Because X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window  would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the event without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow  errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed  and its ID reallocated to another window.  [courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?   Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually, the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that  knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except for GCs and private color cells, can be shared].  The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple  applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the applications' running on different machines) is in the first application to  create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into it. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also knows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.  [Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]  Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level  cooperation among your applications.   Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to  use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it  should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.

A number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return  the wrong child of root. A general solution is to add this code or to use it in your own application where you would normally use RootWindow(dpy,screen):  /* Function Name: GetVRoot  * Description: Gets the root window, even if it's a virtual root  * Arguments: the display and the screen  * Returns: the root window for the client  */ #include <X11/Xatom.h> Window GetVRoot(dpy, scr) Display        *dpy; int             scr; { Window          rootReturn, parentReturn, *children; unsigned int    numChildren; Window          root = RootWindow(dpy, scr); Atom            __SWM_VROOT = None; int             i;    __SWM_VROOT = XInternAtom(dpy, \\\"__SWM_VROOT\\\", False);   XQueryTree(dpy, root, &rootReturn, &parentReturn, &children, &numChildren);   for (i = 0; i < numChildren; i++) {  Atom            actual_type;  int             actual_format;  long            nitems, bytesafter;  Window         *newRoot = NULL;   if (XGetWindowProperty(dpy, children[i], __SWM_VROOT, 0, 1,      False, XA_WINDOW, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems,             &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newRoot) == Success && newRoot) {    root = *newRoot;    break;   }  }   return root; }  [courtesy David Elliott (dce@smsc.sony.com). Similar code is in ssetroot, a version of xsetroot distributed with tvtwm. 2/91]  A header file by Andreas Stolcke of ICSI on export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/vroot.h  functions similarly by providing macros for RootWindow and DefaultRootWindow; code can include this header file first to run properly in the presence of a virtual desktop.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 147)  How do I keep a window from being resized by the user?   Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but  there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. You can try setting  the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best.  [1/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 148)  How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times?   It's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself [e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped --  imagine the conflict between two such programs running.    The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily assuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do  this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup  menus or other short parameter-setting windows).

There is no easy way.  Unless you're willing to depend on some sort of extension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself, either by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games with the colormap and changing the color of the contents.  [Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 7/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib?   Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help  get notification of double-clicking.  There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the  protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do  client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you  have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish  implementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of  the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.  Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should be the single-click action or the double-click action.

Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics  capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics libraries.  Your only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to render the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it \\\"by  hand\\\" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via  XPutImage(); more specifically:  1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.  2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).  3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.  4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where    a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)   b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)  5) render I2  Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.  The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X  also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS, although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer.  In addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph.

To be descriptive, omnipotence must mean \\\"being all-powerful\\\" and not \\\"being able to do anything/everything\\\".  Let me illustrate by analogy. Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the US see fit.  The US would be militarily \\\"omnipotent\\\".  But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current civil war in the former Yugoslavian states.

But effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy  of non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to strongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it could actually do, although it had the power to do \\\"whatever it wanted\\\".

Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.  value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in  usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus.  The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound.   In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing.  In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the word \\\"value\\\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as \\\"objective values.\\\"  Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow. Just because the word \\\"values\\\" is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts.  If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  So, back to the original question:  And objective morality is.....?  If you can provide an objective foundation for \\\"morality\\\" then that will be a good beginning. \",\"I  am  cleaning  out  the coffers.

I'd like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation consoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.  We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes, and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control circuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.  I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the cue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one problem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be a sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute, so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid cuetape!)  Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function. (A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film) This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second. What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit of some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!

Being a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic, I just don't know what to  think about my Honda.  She was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike  week this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and  was running only on one cylinder.  I towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect  working order. No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look  very clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All  still within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a  slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem),  but it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for  this bike.  Any syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone  the cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in  order to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the  wear of my pistons??

My point is that \\\"if life has meaning or importance then we should try to find that meaning or importance\\\" which is almost a tautology. (I hope I'm not being too patronizing.) One term for that meaning is \\\"Creator\\\", though that is not obvious from my above argument.   (It's more like \\\"I think, therefore I am, therefore God is.\\\")   Unfortunately the term \\\"religious\\\" is ambiguous to me in this context.

The US  has never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada  from the Cubans to protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion  of a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).   Vietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess  we \\\"invaded\\\" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have  invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles  for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from  Spain.  So if you mean by the word \\\"invaded\\\" some sort of military action where we cross someone's border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally \\\"invaded\\\" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation. (If some nation \\\"invades\\\" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be invading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)  So from this point of view, your score falls to 2 out of 6 (Mexico, Panama).  [...]  No, it's someone who believes in \\\"peace-at-all-costs\\\".

Well, it depends on what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace over freedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you than life itself; if you'd rather die fighting for liberty than live under a tyrant's heel, then yes, it's \\\"bad\\\" to be a peace-nik.  The problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are not like them to be \\\"bad\\\" and \\\"unconscionable\\\".  I would not have any argument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and stayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with  the national defense.  But no, they are not willing to allow us to legitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and  many times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rank hypocrisy!)

Time to get off the soapbox now.  :)  [...]  Regards,\",\"   [More stuff deleted]  This seems to be a pretty arogant definition of belief.  My beliefs are those things which I find to be true based on my experience of the world.  This experience includes study of things that I may not have experienced directly.  But even then, I can only understand the studies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to what I have experienced.  Which means that by beliefs about God are directly related to my experience of God.  Having experienced God, I try to make sense of that experience.  I study religion and read the Bible.  I find things that echo what I have already experienced.  Out of this I build my beliefs.  I also find things that don't match my experience.  That doesn't make them false.  They just don't match my experience.  Maybe I will understand that stuff later.  I don't know.  Maybe all of my beliefs are wrong.  I can change my beliefs.  If someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what. Neither of us are necessarily wrong.  Someone else is making sense out of a different set of experiences.  Even though we have different explanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that the underlying experiences are similar.  Some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one form, and usually has a single revelation.  The more dogmatic and inflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to an outsider.  There is another approach possible, however.  God is a mystery.  I am trying to solve the mystery, so I look at the evidence available to me.  I try to arrive at the best understanding that I can based on the evidence.  New evidence may cause me to change my understanding.  When I encounter someone with a different belief than my own, it isn't a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discover something new about this mystery I can never fully comprehend.

My definition is this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous   Unless one classifies \\\"thinking and informal exploration\\\" as a mistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would consider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as unscientific.     Here is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not clear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be taken as describing what \\\"science is mainly about.\\\"  Consider, for example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and still not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates, that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that some invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are ubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the definition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are \\\"mainly about.\\\"  The misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition.   I agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.    As to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about \\\"absolute scientific truth.\\\"  I think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have proven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of degree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence.    One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim, the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to speculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence was presently available for them, and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)   I think a lot of scientists steer away from things that -- deserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many researchers' minds.    This is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one wants to become this generation's Rhine.   I think this is absurd.     I wonder why the results were not published.  In my field, dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly eases one's defense.)  Finally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either on NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.

The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and  Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding  Ranford. Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom   played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up  Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge  to Sweden in creating more opportunities.  Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi  made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but  Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada  started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked  hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson  who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and  made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.  The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot  that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.  Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took  a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by  the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.  Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure  but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.  At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to  cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.  That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in   the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he  explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close  to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.  Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a  bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas  then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.  The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a  rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds  in the dressing room.   A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing  great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better  than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best  goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.  Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is  easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,  Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.   The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-  Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the  task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.  Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering  that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very  well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because  of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake  on the 1-3 goal.

However, if someone we know well is praying to God in that spirit, we might have the responsibility to say, \\\"Remember, if God's help is real, then so are His commands.\\\"\",\"I am looking for a math coprocessor for a 286-16mhz.

The floppy interface you suggest handles the former, but it doesn't have any hooks for dealing with the latter... you'd have to kludge it. Plus, it's extremely low performance.

Christopher\",\"Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or contribution to:  In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine.  The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle (even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of the law is no excuse - they will get you too!  It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors.  Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \\\"no way!\\\"  But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one, and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.  Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.  For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave enlightment may be necessary.  So, the questions are -   What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?   Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by   a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector   antenna?   Are any brands \\\"quieter\\\" than others?\",\" Now you know why I am just a DOD member.

SURVEY:  Question 1) Have you ever had trouble reconciling faith and reason? If so, what was the trouble? (For example: -Have you ever been unsure whether Creationism or Evolutionism                holds more truth?               -Do you practice tarot cards, palm readings, or divination that                conflicts with your scientific knowledge of the world?               -Does your religion require you to ignore physical realities that                you have seen for yourself or makes logical sense to you?) Basically, we would like to know if you ever _BELIEVED_ in something that your _REASON_tells you is wrong.  Question 2) If you have had conflict, how did/do you resolve the conflict?  Question 3) If you haven't had trouble, why do you think you haven't? Is there a set of guidelines you use for solving these problems?

I'm a university student with about $7000 to spend, and I'm looking for a  used car. Does anyone have any useful advice they could offer to a first- time buyer? I'm not looking for anything sporty, just something functional  and reliable (less maintenance costs). Anybody have any ideas on what models  might suit me?  Thanks\",\" No.  No.  NOOO!!!  The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if you're grounded in some other way at the same time.    The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.    They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere, repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.)  What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact, depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.  There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and you should probably read it before asking any more questions.  I'll mail a copy to you, append a copy here, and will ask the writers to cross-post it here in the future. \",\" Is this being done with the motherboard's SCSI interface?

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port         2. X terminals         3. NeXT         4. Silicon Graphics         5. IBM RS/6000  6. Other stuff      1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port   If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard  (Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding  a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation  runs the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used  PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable  to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read  the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.   The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.   a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and  even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server  extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your  server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings  appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,  you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,  or bugging your vendor.   kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.  Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.   Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.      2. X terminals   Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use  PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all  set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the  trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add  extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around  for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.      3. NeXT   NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop  Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they  were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of  upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!      4. Silicon Graphics   Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and  beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't  believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not  possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by  upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more  details.      5. IBM RS/6000   IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||  Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||  cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||  smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||  it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||  works.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||  told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||  anything new, please send me e-mail.        ||          6. Other stuff   Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)  support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your  queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can  get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either  from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in  luck.  Contact the companies for more details.

Availability: February, 1993     Price: $219     Supports: Mac only      Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The     keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate     backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are     arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.      The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.     A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.      The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not     directly attachable to the keyboard.

Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products.     Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles     (including PS/2's and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you     a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number     of popular word processors and spreadsheets.      Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions     to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple     people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file     for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.     On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between     words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.     I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000.      The DragonDictate-30K can recognize 30,000 words at a time.     The DragonWriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time.

Did you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name?  Before 1827, before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians,  drove all the Turks/Muslims out, it was a Turkish majority town. Well, anyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the  Nazis.   \\\"Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously   pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,   as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and    anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient.\\\"[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,'      Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438.    As a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots)  was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in Boston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but  had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally Tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect of the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian who became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II. In 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central Committee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the  American-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local Armenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20 chapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters and became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization. Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:   \\\"The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.   Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.\\\"[1]  [1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), \\\"The     Armenian Displaced Persons,\\\" in 'Armenian Affairs,' Winter,     1949-50, p. 19, footnote.   Now wait, there is more.  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \\\"Hojali Disaster\\\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \\\"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\\\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \\\"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\\\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \\\"Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\\\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. \\\"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\\\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. \\\"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\\\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \\\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\\\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \\\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\\\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.

Of those federal and federally funded candidate agencies that you mentioned, I have the following comments:   - SRI, Rand, Mitre, and national labs: I agree that they have         great experience safeguarding sensitive information. I am not         convinced that they would adequately safeguard _this_  information, since in any case requiring disclosure, there's        likely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure- possibly   *wrongful* disclosure.   - GAO: perhaps. I would like to see more concrete evidence of   their fidelity and ability.   - *TREASURY*? Surely you're joking. Perhaps you'd ask BATF  to safeguard keys. Maybe the Federal Reserve would be a   better choice.  Ever since last fall's \\\"trial balloon\\\" was posted in sci.crypt, your name has been synonymous with those who place a great deal of trust in the ability of government agencies and agents to act within the law.  I agree with you in part: those agencies and agents *almost always* act properly. However, there have been enough cases where _sworn agents of the Federal Government_ have acted wrongly to make me feel that having two federal agencies as key repositories is unacceptable.

I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210   and my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need   to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe   place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is   that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it   wrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this   could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.    It could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one   wrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further   correct actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also   my NeXT that way.  Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any   problem, and at pretty high speeds too.  I don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is   pretty standard.\",\"As quoted from <1993Apr17.025258.7013@microsoft.com> by anthonyf@microsoft.com (Anthony Francisco):   That's life.

Your 2F2 cap will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap. The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances, so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering the cold).  You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain, that \\\"rolls over\\\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every 1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would need a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz oscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.  I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.  Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't guarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable conditions.

The explanation    we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult    members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit    of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,    you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule    is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is    incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.  2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were    outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When    questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault    was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were    thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew    you could!  3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,    hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and    referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm    more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not    related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up    some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's    now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by    the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I    was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI    agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say    uncomplimentary.  4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that    the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the    reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing    this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references    to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around    the \\\"He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\\\"    flag.  Sigh.  5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege    reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought    processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button    because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My    only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to    the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to    an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in    the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the    forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In    that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones    Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:    Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and    other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the    BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have    been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it    was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's    paranoid delusions.     --   #include <std_disclaimer.h>\",\"As it says, I'm interested in buying one of the little label-makers, and I can't afford a new one.

Yes, there are still alot of MGBs out there.  The earlier cars (pre  74-1/2) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having  chrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power).  The older cars are  appreciating... slowly.  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the  moment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles. If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car  should last for a long time.  There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere.   The MGB is a great, fun little car.  If she is keeping it solely in the hopes  that it is going to appreciate, tell her to sell it.  It is not worth waiting  the time it would take to appreciate to a real profitable level.\",\"  If you need just to change the wallpaper, then I've written a short program in VB that does this by using SystemParametersInfo-function. The bad news is that you need VBRUN200.DLL to run it, and the DLL is some 350kb (the program is about 7kb). The order of pictures depends on the system date and the number of BMP-files in the directory, so the picture remains the same if you execute the program multiple times during the same day and the number of BMPs has not changed.  If you feel this is what you need then I could uuencode it and email it to you. (It is unavailable via ftp.) \",\" Wales Conference, Adams Division, Semifinal  I'm hoping for a Fuhr miracle, but I agree that Boston will likely win the series.  Goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal (Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau), but Buffalo has no answer to Neely (not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's one of my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin :) ).  And the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway.  But I think it will go six.   Agreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, or does everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!  Final  I can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for 6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play in the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear territorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will not be putting money on this series. :-)    Agreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent of the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is credit to NY.   Agreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent team, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.   I think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don't think it will go six either...*maybe* five.   If Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They own the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once again I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the Habs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.    Chicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good, IMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.   Very true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out why Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three  at MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.   It _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all.  And yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.    Our first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their size *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team chasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.   This is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough.  I don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a non-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate Gretzky.  LA in six.   If it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be LA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.   Wow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I picked LA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.   If Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet against the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong because they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose, though, I'd have to take the Penguins.  A side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than Gilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from the age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team. I'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while he and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge), Gilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp. from Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best all-round players in the NHL.  \",\" Well, you really can't dig a hole with a stock Shovel; you at least need some performance mods like stroking and cams.

The bears are a national treasure, the area is their sanctuary and people who enter it do so at their own risk.  It is better that that rare human be killed by a bear than that bears be provoked or shot by unbear-savvy visitors.  The bears aren't having a population explosion, humans are so it is better that a human be killed than endanger the bears. I don't agree with this philosopy, but I understand it.   The psychos are a bit different.

I have been running Mathcad 3.1, under Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode, with a 5MB RAM drive, 2MB/1MB Smart drive, and no swap file (permanent or temporary) for several months.

I'm not having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with O'Reilly's ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net.  The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does (which makes no sense to me).  The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors, apparently because the mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So you can't actually edit any colors.  We have X11 R5 patch level 22; 8-bit pseudoColor visual.  I've poked around  in the xcms code in Xlib, but without some understanding of the theory I have  no idea what's going wrong.

Thanx to der (schoene) Mouse for his help too. \",\" If you are interested in a program which is very easy to use, I strongly  suggest Approach 2.0.  It is extremely easy to use, make reports, etc.  I own both it and Paradox, and I almost never use Paradox.  If you need to  build up a complicated application, then Paradox is the way to go.  I have heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic. Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/ home use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach.  I  have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily: I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must  be different than what is the logical ordering.  To permanently reorder (to  use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records  appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order) exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach  database), and then copying the exported files back to the original  filename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really  like about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than  the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).  Paradox also  takes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12MB) and RAM).\",\"Dear Folks:  It's a pleasure to be able to announce the release of a new freeware program,  Xavier, an audio and video  extension to InterViews.  Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library that adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite multimedia objects to be built from media objects.  Specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the source code for the original classes (though several configuration files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file).    Currently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN workstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.  Xavier has been tested in the following environments:  SUN:   Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC   OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later   C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1  NEC(EWS):   Machine : EWS4800/210,230   OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2   C++     : C++ Release3.1  It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from            interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/           (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)  We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier. If you are interested, please contact                                    xavier@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp.   I will add your e-mail address to our list.

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger    economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a    lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,    but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing    military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than    just a \\\"we have the money, why not?\\\" approach.  Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European cooperation.  Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of money (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at the size of that multiplier :->).\",\"I have a set of four 235-60-R14 Big O tires that I had on my 1988 Thunder  Bird.

(818) 354-5011  Contact:  Mary A. Hardin  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993 #1506       Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to measure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.       The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airport reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took measurements as part of a program established to correlate data with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).         The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle Discovery.       \\\"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important ways,\\\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on the balloon research campaign.         \\\"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\\\" he continued.  \\\"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists, and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own right.\\\"       The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring.  Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps scientists construct more accurate computer models which are instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.       The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere; a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the atmosphere absorbs sunlight.        Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three- hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130 kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m. Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded to separate from the balloon.       \\\"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurements,\\\" Margitan explained, \\\"and we also needed to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\\\"       It will be several weeks before scientists will have the completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS scientists.           The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon Facility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a contract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.       The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.       The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements Program.                        \",\" Yes, it is -- you could look it up.

Recently, I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 12-15 hours after birth. He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Boston and has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition. This has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with hospitals, procedures...etc.  I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but his condition was termed  quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight as a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs and that did not seem to help out. His MRI, EKG, cat-scans are all normal, but the EEG's show alot of seizure activity. After many metabolic tests, body structure tests, and infection/virus tests the doctors still do not know quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have alot of evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ).

God is just, giving to everyone what they deserve. As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf Romans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole of the human race except Mary, have sinned.  Which is why Jesus said, \\\"Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless he is born of water and Spirit\\\" which is the true meaning of born again (John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.  As St. Augustine said, \\\"I did not invent original sin, which the Catholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a doubt are a follower of a new heresy.\\\"  (De nuptiis, lib. 11.c.12)\",\" This is why I asked to be 'enlightened'.

Again, if we are truely intrested in eliminating the DEBT, we must REMOVE the DEFICIT, and do away with ALL PORK !!!    There have been several books written on gov. waste, network news programs  from time to time devote segments to this, and there have been bills proposed that significantly reduces expenditures without touching external programs by  changing the way 'congress does business' (and make it more efficent).  True, blame is easy, but also is spending someone else's money.    Clinton ran on a platform that he would '...not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these (his) programs'.  He has proposed a program that is not  specific, that counts on tax hikes to pay for.  --  ======================================================================  Ken M.

Thanks very much.\",\" I have been following this thread and figured I'd throw in my two cents...  The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus (7.16 vs 8.33 MHZ). The Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  OS since '85 and can operate with 1 MB RAM!  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.  A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data and moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate even better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape units.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be what I am doing while reading this group.  Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which, thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to completely get rid of IDE. --   Wayne Summer        //        AMIGA - Simply the Best.   Palm Bay, FL.

While I can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area. I rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is more likely to become such a tool, and that it IS such a tool in many instances.   I suspect that this is because \\\"improvement in the human condition\\\" as you define it is not the primary goal of libertarianism, and would not be the primary goal of a libertarian government.  My impression of libertarianism is that its primary goal is the elimination of government coercion except in a very limited cases. --  Ian Sutherland ian@eecs.nwu.edu\",\" Nope.

A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are     using them and fewer deem drug use as risky.       For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results     from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is     being won.  But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by     eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students     nationwide.      Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If     drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will     have fewer \\\"drug-using contemporaries\\\" who act as examples of     substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,     one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths \\\"must be given     the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,\\\"     Johnston says.      This type of resurgence \\\"is possible,\\\" says Eileen Shiff, author of     \\\"Experts Advise Parents\\\" (Delta, $14.95).  But that's not the issue,     she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today     could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.      Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with     drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to     their children.  \\\"I've even seen parents serving kegs of beer\\\" to     their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,     Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, \\\"lock-in\\\" party where     no booze or drugs were allowed.  \\\"We need to fulfill that parental     role, otherwise the peer group takes over,\\\" she says.      Officials may \\\"talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven't     done anything that I've seen,\\\" says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,     Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and     other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a     member of USA Today's Teen Panel, says \\\"there's always going to be     experimentation\\\" with drugs.      A real war on drugs could be waged \\\"education-wise,\\\" she says.  But     \\\"some don't want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give     them ideas; it's the same with birth control.  I think you should     give the kids the information or have it accessible\\\" through classes,     pamphlets and speakers, she says.      Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in     kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores,     Fla.  \\\"I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs).  I think     kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds     (about using drugs),\\\" he says.      Scare tactics in public service announcements aren't working; only     one commercial has gotten it right, he says.  The commercial opens     with two \\\"good-looking girls\\\" in the restroom talking about having     no prom date.

I think I could have used a Bat-mom. Would have made getting my license a lot easier!  There's a trend here: Stylish helmet, Stylish knee-dragging, rides only in Stylish cartoon precipitation.

We'll write and ask if Batman would like to become an honorary Denizen! Yeah!  Special To The KoTL: Is there a precedent for inducting an imaginary member with an imaginary motorcycle?

Ninja Gourmet Will fight for food.\\u001b  \",\"  Ed of course has never demonstrated remarkable knowlege of socialism,  or any other political system come to that.   That leaves Germany, Japan and the UK as examples of a country where the right wing government is on the verge of collapse. Oh and of course the USA which just elected a socialist government :-)   Etc, unfortunately you can't pin this on the left or the right, both are to blame. Both sides are equally deep into the corruption scandal. The only  untained party is the northern league which is a bunch of nationalist separatists and the communist party which has collapsed.    Ed should take a look at the budget deficit Regan and Bush created together before he starts to make claims about europe collapsing based on the budget deficits here. None of them are serious on the USA scale.  And here in Europe we have zero interest in Ed-Ipser type freed thank you. We do not want our countries to be run by a narrow elite of rich lawyers for the benefit of the super wealthy. We are quite happy with social  democracy and despite the fuss made in Time and Newsweek there is remarkably little being done to reverse the social welfare reforms brought in by socialism.  The problem with socialism is that it started with the aims of free education and health care and provision of the welfare state. This has been achieved across the whole of Europe, only the USA is struggling to catch up. The problem for socialism is what to do now it has succeeded.    Ed starts to discus LA, presumably he thinks that it is in Europe. On the other hand he most probably hasn't heard of a European city.   Rather the opposite. What is happening in Italy is that the communist party has collapsed. This has meant that the grand coalition between right and left wing parties to keep out the communists has also collapsed. The  magistrates have seized this opportunity to crack down hard on fraud and  corruption and have arrested half the politicians. The fact that the socialists are in charge this week is incidental, the right is into the corruption just as baddly.

How modern how daring how liberating How modern how daring how liberating they chant  The sophomore, being American Doesn't know That his ``question''     modern        skeptical            cynical  Was asked before, by a     modern        skeptical            cynical    urbane cosmopolitan  Politician (appointed not elected) Who happened to live two thousand years ago.  Like many politicians he cared      Less about ideals          than results      Less about ends          than means      Less about anything          than keeping his job               (and his head).  We might call him A bit brutal Though `firm' would be kinder (And no doubt Stalin, who let nobody go, laughed at his laxness) He didn't like his job; perhaps he no longer hoped for better (Nor feared worse, except regarding his head).  And when these wily Jews With their heads-I-win, tails-you-lose      conundrums Brought forth their madman, His first impulse was to play the Roman: ``I find nothing wrong with him,   See to it yourselves.''  But when they mentioned `King' and `Caesar' His heart froze.  If he killed their madman     He'd start a riot          and lose his job              (and his head)  If he saved the King of the Jews     He'd piss off Caesar          and lose his job              (and his head)  And when his wife told him to have    Nothing to do with the righteous lout She didn't tell him anything    He hadn't already figured out.  So he punted.  ``Not my jurisdiction!  Take him to see Herod!'' (who just happened to be in town....)  Herod appreciated the courtesy But wasn't worried         And sent the sharp-tongued fool      (Who suddenly didn't have much to say,     funny how people lose it under pressure....)   back In the attire proper   to his Royal State.  His ass is covered---if Herod has no problem, Caesar certainly won't.  The fool can be king of whatever world he wants as long as it's not Caesar's.  ``I'm letting him go,'' he said with a shout. (Looks like he'll last this one out....)  The crowd's reaction puzzled him.   They really wanted him dead. They didn't want the King of the Jews,   They wanted Barabbas instead (And, as Josephus records, they got him)  Oh well, he thought, They all look the same to me. And we'll get Barabbas next time.  And if I can get them to say    ``We have no king but Caesar!''    By killing a madman, Hell, I'll kill ten a day.

Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the visible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.  It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to be useful, but not dangerously so.\",\" Look, guy, I doubt anyone here approves of Drunk Driving, but if he's been caught and convicted and punished maybe you ought to lighten up?

What was \\\"fixed\\\" or changed from 2.0 > 2.2?\",\"I've been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington,  I think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of  etymology.  I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my  childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes.   I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very  angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It  carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some  time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and  `Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To  become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would  consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared  to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a  better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable  riches of knowing Christ.  As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that  they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time  they had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They  didn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.   For example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.    When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her  death, she said to me, \\\"As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew.\\\"  What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a  Jew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with  matzoh balls.:-))   I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My  sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who  do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people  Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.  This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their  experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while  following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.    I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.   It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have  a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small  sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it  and do not want to ask for it back.  And while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.   I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the  Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is  that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again,  being rooted in the past.   This is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess  around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of  Easter).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.  I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all  believers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish  Christian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. \",\" The following postscript works for LaserWriter IIg's with version 2 roms  %! 0 serverdict begin exitserver << /FactoryDefaults true >> setsystemparams systemdict begin realtime 10000 add { dup realtime le { pop exit } if } loop quit\",\"Hi folks,   what exactly is the maximum memory I can put in a Quadra 700.

True, Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still, these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with lots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereas Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.      That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb pitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of a chance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no pitching.  At least, to me.      I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team with Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real order, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but with a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.) Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig, Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.      I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by seasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in their best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all the players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.

The argument was  1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game. 2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%.  3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and earned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12% of defense and pitching is 88% of defense. 4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.  Pete is usually sharper than that. My own feel is that fielding is in the 25-33% of defense range; call it 30-70 between fielding and pitching.   I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe 45-5, or even 40-10.

How do I make a screendump or print my application?   The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window  or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window.  The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr  client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:   csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd & and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current display will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an undocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the  command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for  specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]   Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of  arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc. There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92] is the most recent.  xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders  XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr; see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.  A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information:  soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.  xprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.   To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr, which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps and XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for  use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive servers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.   The XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and save it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.   Also:    Bristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter  2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net in vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.   ColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen- capture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and  non-PostScript printers.   Some vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows)  include session managers or other desktop programs which include \\\"print portion of screen\\\" or \\\"take a snapshot\\\" options. Some platforms also have tools which  can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example,  have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals  have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.   Some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct  support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package  to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?   If you need color PostScript in particular, you can   - grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color  PostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv   - grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS. You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick  distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?   This can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider  instead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?   The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++  Portable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting  among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps,  gray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently; the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.  Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in  particular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary. It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).   Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are  later versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.   Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export;  see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.   xv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley),  can read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF,  GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity,  contrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned  formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on  it, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92;  see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.   The Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>. Conversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available via FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z,  and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.   The Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads and writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.   The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar  to PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*,  weedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.   Xim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential  interactive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is  a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and  Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif,  xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a library and command-line utilities for building your own applications.   ImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from  export's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display images on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF from other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.   xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining simple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90] xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.   A version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool is available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package  also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget.

The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the string which appears in the window titlebar.  A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell:   echo \\\"ESC]2;TEXT^G\\\" where ESC is the escape key, TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed, and ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character).   Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change directories:   alias newcd 'cd \\\\!*; echo -n ESC]2\\\\;$cwd^G'   The digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should  change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name  used in the icon, use the digit '0' instead, and use '1' to change only the  icon name.   Note: another way to do this, which prevents an incorrect display of the local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell, is to wrap the escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself.   Note: on an IBM RS/6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with a ^V.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  29)  Where can I find the xterm control sequences?  The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file  ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z.  O'Reilly's Volume 3, the X User's Guide, includes an R5 version of the control  sequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93, and a Motif version of  the book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version of the control sequences. [1/93]  Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document and also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a  compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100  sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was  published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).  In a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.  [last updated 10/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm, et al, fail against the R4 server? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?   In order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to  \\\"stty pass8\\\" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as   XTerm*font:  -*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1  XTerm*boldfont: -*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 [The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]  In addition, you may want to set this in your shell:  setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1          For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with  the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using `man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (')  is Alt-'.

You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give  a resource specification like this:   xterm*geometry: 80x24 then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to 80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size.  But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:   xterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?   You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command.  However, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for  manipulating the selection will help; e.g.   % xselection PRIMARY | lpr finds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a  window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties. A version is on export.  Also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be adapted to do this.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?   You can use several environment variables to control how resources are  loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and  XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for  application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.   Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a  way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies. Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also  have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could  set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up  app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located):  setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N  The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see  XtResolvePathname()):          %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the                 application's class name.         %T      The value of the file \\\"type\\\".  In this case, the                 literal string \\\"app-defaults\\\"         %C      customization resource (R5 only)         %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.         %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \\\"ja_JP.EUC\\\")         %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \\\"ja\\\")         %t      The territory part of the display's language string         %c      The codeset part of the display's language string   Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is  \\\"Myterm\\\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the  example omits locale-specific lookup.)  /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm  $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm   As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above  app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it  and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to  search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.   Let's consider another example. This time, let's set  XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working  directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.  setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N   The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands  to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging  because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file  Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and %S are useless.   With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization  resource value.  For example, you might run the \\\"myterm\\\" application like this:  myterm -xrm \\\"*customization: -color\\\"   If one of your pathname specifications had the value \\\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\\\" then the expanded pathname would be \\\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\\\" because the %C substitution character  takes on the value of the customization resource.   The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:   /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N   (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.)   The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is    <root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   <root>/%L/%N:\\\\   <root>/%l/%N:\\\\   <root>/%N:   <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory  if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other  than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.   Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find  your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR  to \\\".\\\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3  compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \\\"./\\\", a dot followed  by a slash.  [Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?  The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources; for example,  your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line   DisplayManager.0.authorize: false  to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also   DisplayManager*xrdb: /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:  #!/bin/sh  #comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources  /usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap  /usr/bin/X11/xrdb $* Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.  Note that this is a  general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client.  [Thanks to Jay Bourland (jayb@cauchy.stanford.edu), 9/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  36)  Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my .xsession file?   When xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login files. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script; or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and source it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or, if you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your  .xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting your .xsession file off with \\\"#!/bin/csh\\\".   If this doesn't work, also try starting off with:   #!/bin/sh   # Reset path:   PATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?   There are several ways to avoid having to do a \\\"setenv DISPLAY ...\\\" whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.  One solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It  includes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and xrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine. A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.  One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from 132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and $DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then  propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain   eval `xrlogind` where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special  format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to  recreate the environment variables. [11/90]   In addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on  another host, and you find   rsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY  too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh  can be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be    xrsh <HOST> xterm    #! /bin/sh   # start an X11 process on another host   # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT   # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu>   # rsh $host -n \\\"setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null\\\"   #   # An improved version:   # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson, jr@bbn.com)   #       (generalized for sh,ksh by Keith Boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu)   #   # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.

One way is to use the \\\"bitmap\\\" client or some other bitmap-editor (e.g. Sun's icon-editor tool, post-processed with pbmplus) to design the individual  characters and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate  them into the BDF format. See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X  Journal for more information.  The R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained  a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.  An easier way is to use the \\\"xfed\\\" client to modify an existing font; a version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is  available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63],  possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce BDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.  The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors, XPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in /pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed  [5/91] in export:/contrib.   If you are a MetaFont user you can use \\\"mftobdf\\\" from the SeeTeX distribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe, a font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.  The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these tools to modify a font.  Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?   After you have built the font using your system's font-compiler,  installed it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent (e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp  $dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the  directory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably  leaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in  the path.)  Sometimes your \\\"xset +fp $dir\\\" command fails with a BadValue error:   X Error of failed request:BadValue    (integer parameter out of range for operation)   Major opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)   This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The mention of an \\\"integer parameter\\\" in the message is spurious.)  -- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file    system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your    font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an    xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \\\"xset +fp ~/myfonts\\\") and    the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.  -- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server    (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file    \\\"fonts.dir\\\".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're    running OpenWindows, look for the file \\\"Families.list\\\".  If you can't find    it, run bldfamily(1).)  -- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a    proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for    example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.    Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for    Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work    for X11Rn.

A tool called \\\"snftobdf 1.4\\\" is part of the bdftools package, which is  available from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from  crl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?   der Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and  produces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be  used as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can  understand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools  such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail  from mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]  In addition, the R5 program \\\"fstobdf\\\" can produce bdf for any font that the R5 server has access to.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?   The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation, but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file  contrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is  for a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for  creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers  which do not use the MIT font scheme.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  43)  How do I add \\\".bdf\\\" fonts to my DECwindows server?   The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the \\\".pcf\\\" format. You can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc font-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a performance hit.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?) I want to be able to do something like this:  xclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave   You can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the  same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because  of this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since  there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore,  neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap  converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a  resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for  use in many of its widgets, however. [courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]  However:  A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of  the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick  (basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of  image formats as a pixmap.   The leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used  by Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by AT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM  distribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write  routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information on the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on  the R5 contrib tape. [A set of XPM icons collected by Anthony Thyssen  (anthony@kurango.cit.gu.edu.au) is on export in contrib/AIcons.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  45)  Why can't I override translations? Only the first item works.   You probably have an extra space after the specification of the first  item, like this:  basic*text.translations:  #override \\\\  Ctrl<Key>a:    beginning-of-line() \\\\n\\\\    Ctrl<Key>e:    end-of-line()            ^ extra space The newline after that space is ending the translation definition. [Thanks to Timothy J. Horton, 5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  46)  How can I have xclock or oclock show different timezones?   One solution is xchron, in Volume 6 of comp.sources.x, which can show the time for timezones other than the local one.   Alternatively, you can probably set the timezone in the shell from which you invoke the xclock or oclock, or use a script similar to this:  #!/bin/sh  TZ=PST8PDT xclock -name \\\"San_Luis_Obispo_CA\\\" 2> /dev/null &  TZ=EST5EDT xclock -name \\\"King_Of_Prussia_PA\\\" 2> /dev/null &  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  47)  I have xmh, but it doesn't work. Where can I get MH?   The xmh mail-reader requires the Rand MH mail/message handling system, which is not part of the UNIX software distribution for many machines. A list  of various ftp, uucp, e-mail and US-mail sites for both xmh and MH is given in  the monthly MH FAQ; one source is ics.uci.edu in the file pub/mh/mh-6.7.tar.Z. If you do not receive the comp.mail.mh newsgroup or the MH-users mailing list,  you can request a copy of the FAQ, which also includes a section on xmh,  by sending mail to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu containing the request \\\"send usenet/news.answers/mh-faq\\\".  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  48)  Why am I suddenly unable to connect to my Sun X server? After a seemingly random amount of time after the X server has been started, no other clients are able to connect to it.   The default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun (for 4.0.3, at least) delete \\\"old\\\" (unreferenced) files from /tmp -- including /tmp/.X11-unix, which  contains the socket descriptor used by X. The solution is to add \\\"! -type s\\\" to the find exclusion in the cron job.

How do I get my Sun Type-[45] keyboard fully supported by Xsun?   Many users wants the Num Lock key to light the Num Lock LED and have the  appropriate effect on the numeric keypad. The Xsun server as distributed by MIT doesn't do this but there are two different patches available.   The first patch is written by Jonathan Lemon and fixes the Num Lock related  problems. It is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in the file contrib/Xsun-R5.numlock_patch.Z .   The second is written by Martin Forssen and fixes the Num Lock and Compose keys and adds support for the different national keyboard layouts for Type-4 and  Type-5 keyboards. This patch is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/sunkbd1216-0314.tar.Z or via email from maf@dtek.chalmers.se.   [thanks to Martin Forssen (maf@dtek.chalmers.se or maf@math.chalmers.se), 8/92]  A set of patches by William Bailey (dbgwab@arco.com) was posted to newsgroups 11/92 to provide support for the Type-5 keyboard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  51)  How do I report bugs in X?   Generally, report bugs you find to the organization that supplied you with the X Window System. If you received the R5 source distribution directly  from MIT, please read the file mit/bug-report for instructions. [Look in mit/doc/bugs/bug-report in R4.]  [Thanks to Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>, 5/91; 12/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  52)  Why do I get \\\"Warning: Widget class version mismatch\\\"?   This error, which typically goes on to say, \\\"widget 11004 vs.  intrinsics 11003\\\" indicates that the header files you included when building  your program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking  against was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure.  However, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the  X11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun OW systems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library,  and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you have seen.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  53)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster?   Webster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster's Dictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became aware that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster  and gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access.  [The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. A Webster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu  (129.79.254.192) in \\\"pub/webster/NeXT-2.0\\\".]  Unless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site which can grant you access, you are probably out of luck.    However, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up the latest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file  xwebster.README includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and  non-availability of dictionary servers.

No. The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not  \\\"public domain\\\", which has a specific legal meaning. However, the X  distribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee.  Contributed software, though, may be placed in the public domain by individual authors.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  56)  How compatible are X11R3, R4, and R5? What changes are there?  The Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the  previous release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility  across releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary,  details are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the  network also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the  file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.

The Itar-TASS news agency announced the launch of Cosmos 2238 from  Plesetsk Cosmodrome, but provided little description of the payload's mission.       However, based on the satellite's trajectory, Western observers  identified it as a military spacecraft designed to monitor electronic  emissions from foreign naval ships in order to track their movement.       Geoff Perry of the Kettering Group in England... [said]  Western  observers had concluded that no more would be launched. But days after the  last [such] satellite re-entered the Earth's atmosphere, Cosmos 2238 was  launched.   \\\"Cosmos-2238\\\" Satellite Launched for Defense Ministry Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian  1238 GMT 30 March 1993 Translated in FBIS-SOV-93-060, p.27 by ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova      Moscow, 30 March -- The Cosmos-2238 satellite was launched at 1600 Moscow  time today from the Baykonur by a \\\"Tsiklon-M\\\" carrier rocket. An ITAR-TASS  correspondent was told at the press center of Russia's space-military forces  that the satellite was launched in the interests of the Russian Defense  Ministry. \",\"  First of all, \\\"ceremonial law\\\" is an extraScriptural term.  It is sometimes used as a framework to view Scripture.  But if you look at Collosions, without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be  a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.  against us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days, or the keeping of the sabbath.  The word for sabbath in this verse is \\\"sabbaton\\\" and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.  If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption \\\"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law\\\" then he will have to find some way around it, like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the 7tH day, Because \\\"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.\\\"  But Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal  statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings.  Also, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which talks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society that did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were slaves.  It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath if it had been mandatory.  Why is there no mention of this in the epistles?\",\"I think I've seen this bike.

Can we perhaps as the question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal to the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written with something else in mind and \\\"propoganda\\\" put out by its supporters.         But let's be honest about something, here.  When was the last time you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?         Or are they simply propogranda?  We can't know what Phill *really* means because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince.          If they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why on earth did you make a point of calling them \\\"propogranda?\\\"  That would seem to be irrelevent.          Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe they no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were good arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.          Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political system, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this particular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure and tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)           In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have had less power?           Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although badly) to the U.S. President.          Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives is \\\"in principle\\\" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate) but in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put those extra restrictions on the Senate in?         Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of government to \\\"attack\\\" which presents them with the best chance of getting what they want.  With national \\\"interest groups\\\" it is simply a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a law rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less  \\\"contributions\\\" to make.          Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at the Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance, medicine, and most other questions.        Local government has not \\\"failed\\\" in that it hasn't done what it should, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their rules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout, only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose its will on the lower.        I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus- and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed to a local crime?        The more people want the more Congress will take power to \\\"sell\\\" it to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of \\\"special interests\\\" is coincidence with the increased power of Congress.          Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness.          Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable of educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the \\\"pork\\\" in that state.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get what they want, individual voices have more relative impact.         The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must \\\"buy off\\\" states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.          But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself  that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem is significantly reduced.          The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable to action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those decisions a good thing.          The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is harder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing new deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out without a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different areas, different solutions may be called for.         And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local and state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to the city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in Washington with half a million or more constituents.         I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels are more corrupt.            Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators should be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was suppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this. Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders wanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them, I never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution, which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for the House.          The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration of Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other examples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the reasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)          To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something it wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which almost necessitates its abuse.          *BUSH?*  Phill, that's absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of which was over-ridden.  Go read up on FDR if you think that's anything resembling a record.          Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system against action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have not been successful.  When you're in a position of imposing federal power on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to got through something more than a bare majority          Now we're switching from a general question of a fillibuster to a specific bill.  I don't see how it make a difference.          Sure it's arguable.  Theyr'e *arguing* it.  However, requiring 60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they'll have to have a *good* argument.  Something that isn't based solely on party lines.          No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority for *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough about.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don't advocate the minority being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing the *federal* system against action. \",\"does anyone have Prez.

Frankly, the Saturn way of doing business and service was a *very* big plus. I hadn't bought a new car since I bought my Honda 4WD back in '85, and I was unbelieveably offended by most salespeople I met.  Saturn was indeed very different. I made three different visits to the dealer where I bought my car, and was never pressured. Saturn also had the best after-sales support, and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly what I wanted to buy. Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the dealer. He's been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a Saturn, based on what he's seen and heard from his customers.   Saturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year/60K miles,  fully refunded if you don't use it. That works out to an actual cost of $170 or so, based on the 6 year treasury rates. Using savings account rates it's more like $120. In the first three years it also buys you free rental during any warranty work, without counting against the refund.\",\" I think this is a weak argument.  The fact is, there are *two* references to Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least been altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage says the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for Jesus and may be authentic.    There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference to Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which lack the references.  It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but I don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in the scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes this position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view that Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to the historicity of Jesus.)\",\"Ditto...

Chiu knows the score and is just being silly. However, \\\"decibel\\\" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is right on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.  Strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels, and a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel, hence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).  The bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are all named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fine way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field. Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers, but had been left out in having a term or unit named after him until recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.) All the other units were defined many decades earlier.       --  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    \",\"I am using a 8507 IBM monitor (19\\\" greysale) with a Trident (1MB) card.

Oak Park also has an illegal handgun ban as well, but does allow those with a \\\"collectors FFL\\\" to possess (\\\"collectible?\\\") handguns.   Probably a fine in practical terms.   It wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident in Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a handgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand, a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend himself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA Director who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided not to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs has it's own drawbacks, like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his house, and told him: \\\"this is stepping over the line; this could get dangerous for you.\\\" Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers watched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief and his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family.

She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she  believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.   (Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the  food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit forming) ?  This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are: Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in  pet food?  ----------------------------------- I speak for myself and not Motorola -----------------------------------  \",\"Is anyone out there running a MS-DOS system with a LocalTalk board?

This topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion flap started.  As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice. They showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as hydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman constant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out of kilter, and you get sick and die.  I've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real life.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this book, I would imagine you would have to:  1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy    water.  2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other    molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.  During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingested was heavy.  You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both alarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here.  Come to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was no longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.  The most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids would literally be \\\"heavy\\\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and heavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by about 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that the victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test involving the specific gravity of a body fluid?

Arab governments generally don't care much about the Palestineans and their struggle but find it useful for political purposes back home. They are happy to leave the Palestineans largely under Israeli control because that leaves the job of controlling them to the Israelis.  The Israelis don't like this job any more than King Hussein of Jordan liked it -- and he managed to kill them off at the rate of thousands per month when they started an Intifada in Jordan.  The governments of Syria, Lebanon and Egypt all feel similarly.  However, proclaiming public support for the Palestinean war against Israel deflects criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to even the most brutal Arab tyrants.  Arab *PEOPLE* probably aren't much more sympathetic.  Palestineans have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in Jordan, Lebanon and Kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere.  You might still be right in sympathy to the war against Israel, but I suspect that many Arabs, far removed from the immediate border with Israel (e.g. in Kuwait or Morroco), couldn't care less. \",\"  Okay Mr. Dyer, we're properly impressed with your philosophical skills and ability to insult people.

In comparison, in  the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall  decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in  gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of  this disease from 1985 through 1992.       In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department  of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992,  reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively  (Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics  (15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases  with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7%  of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by  age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or  equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all  reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the  largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age  group-specific rate (639 per 100,000).       Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver  metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the  state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area  occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods  considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.       When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among  men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in  the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits  by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases  diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men,  the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised  94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among  self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992,  respectively).       Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO,  university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted  to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea  culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased  23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the  fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).       From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and  Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado  increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992,  the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for  whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000)  (Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from  1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases  increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.

Surveillance and Information Systems Br,  Div of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for  Prevention Svcs, CDC.   Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992  may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more  complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH  surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea  cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories  suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact.  However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning  laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the  gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.       One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in  Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a  recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs  (2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area  coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires  further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated  previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6)  -- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom  gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs,  and gang affiliation.       The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the  national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective  19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for  gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at  greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race- specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as  socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.       In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado,  interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting  partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at  increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black  males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in  schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted  primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to  perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational  interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of  members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders  and health-care providers.

Child safety seats and safety  belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50  states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety  belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by  an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major  cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of  occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for  those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In  addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to  use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between  adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints  for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC  analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  (BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this  study.       Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to  18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based,  random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury  Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499  (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent  was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for  that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in  this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than  consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up).  Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software  for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates  and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined  by p values of less than 0.05.       Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six  (Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no  law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania,  and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a  vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse  of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary  enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a  safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states  used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use.  The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law  requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law  (no-law states).       Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not  consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and  adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square  test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus  43.2%, respectively).       High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1  year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than  consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported  high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age  (range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for  adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child- occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1%  for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of  consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult  safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age  groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).       Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded  that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition,  higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with  increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated  with increased adult safety-belt use (8).   Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National  Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others  indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely  to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these  nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit  other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater  risk for motor-vehicle injury (10).       Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with  child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs  should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low  educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such  programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve  low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are  directed at parents with young children.       Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In  addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment,  those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do  not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety  belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and  safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may  increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers --  the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the  highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES                                IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC                          AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88        Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance  systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance  in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for  the years 1983-1988.       Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program  and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population- based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The  prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983- 1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan  Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race,  sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.       Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal  alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the  kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general  diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand  limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are  probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these  defects are relatively easy to diagnose.       Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy  termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However,  the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be  related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene  pool, or random variation.       Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several  collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in  the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on  the impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices  of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO  collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza  viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and  territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians.  Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received  throughout the year.       Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B  viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency  overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted  over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices  of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were  similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of  identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype  increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the  1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were  reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza  A(H1N1).       Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of  influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the  importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since  amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.       Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced  throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make  informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual  surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates  for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.  Authors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona                   High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies  Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF- ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been  developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT),  embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together,  these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive  technology (ART) procedures.   Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or  pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility  management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to  proceed with one of the ART procedures.   Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility  service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and  Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in  ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients  in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the  traditional therapies.   The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our  Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the  realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are:   o in vitro  o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube    transfer  o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation.  This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed  towards improved success of these technologies.

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then  subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA  amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization.   There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by  other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and  hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ  hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of  which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit  sex-linked disorders.   The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that  it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility  of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth  of affected children.

In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our  Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of  unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and  the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred  to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under  strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being  processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our  andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to  perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically  stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing  hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo  lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs  obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic  egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia,  we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our  Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.        Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal  deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male  factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall  success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per  cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173  IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.       Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is  disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological  factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well  recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous  ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle  attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant  of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an  Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of  traditional therapies.       The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not  been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs  available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates  significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years;  and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is  unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our  Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may  be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that  fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant  proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently,  the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our  program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs  of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.        GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room,  usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves  introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian  tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization  occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF,  with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for  transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such  pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility  and/or idiopathic infertility.          The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990  indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained  with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36  percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might  expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our  program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while  substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the  patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing  a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing  general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from  obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs,  and the developmental competency of resultant embryos.       The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial  environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between  January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT  cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.       Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when  embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos.  This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for  success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical  issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated  by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from  both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs  should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.       Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new,  is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but  who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in  combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10  percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the  procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under  the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm  through enzymatic digestion.       Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10  percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly  relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm.  Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques  for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such  efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology  offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to  establish conception.

That is, we  observe in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced  by a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be  its own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.  God, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject  to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being,  God's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence  of a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the  supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused  phenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the  supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very  nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.  This is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted  to clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the  natural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being  interchangeable.\",\" Yes.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display ==========================================================  PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software) ======================  IMDISP ------   IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,   enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS   data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions   [PC and Macs]  LabVIEW 2 ---------   LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   \\\"program\\\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even   hole filling.    The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.    GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,   documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been   developed by Spyglass.

It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,   tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting   things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of   images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined   convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw   data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also   does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,   though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac   that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version   from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)  PhotoMac --------   Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700  PhotoPress ----------   Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973  PixelTools and TCL-Image ------------------------   \\\"Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications   software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

You'll need at least a Mac II with co-   processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn't   run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1    In the documentation the contact address is given as:  Liz Smith, Jet   Propulsion Laboratory, MS 300-323, 4800 Oak Grove Dr,.Pasadena, CA 91109   (818) 354-6980  Visualization Workbench -----------------------   \\\"An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image   analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting.\\\"    Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112  Adobe Photoshop ---------------    The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey   scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,   blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,   EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,   PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the \\\"auto selection tool\\\"   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close   hues, color range and mask.

Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283  Digital Darkroom ----------------   The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and   editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by \\\"painting\\\" it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator \\\"paint\\\" with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd., Suite J San Diego, CA   92126 619-695-6956  Dimple ------   It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or   II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has   the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image   enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and   unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations.

Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: \\\"Laplacian, medium noise filter\\\", etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,   the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic, etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is   available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - \\\"AIPS++\\\" - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and   Australia to name a few.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using   the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,   automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to   byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically   and carefree.    It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that   difficult to write your own with their programmer's module.    Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for   a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000   with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display\\\"  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil   exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual   pages, and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.   For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun   console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X   windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of   convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]    MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,    byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or    without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,    line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp    masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,    line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan    bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to    region target mean, median, or modal value. o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,    brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive    background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical    aperture shape to image isophotes.  o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot    of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`    centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,    change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and    adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function    or histogram equalization. o  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for    registration. o  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or    2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers    can be cycled through.

As an organization their fundamental purpose is to translate the scriptures into the native languages which in terms usual means learning it and  developing a written language (along with teaching the natives to read). It is not associated with the U.S. govt. at all.  Many governments want the help of the translators.  To the best of my knowledge the  Mexican government now encourages them to come.  Their idea is not cultural interference but the presentation of the Good News.  To understand more about what they do, I suggest you read some of the books (autobiographical and biographical) about some of the translators.  One that stands out in my mind as an excellent is called \\\"Peace Child.\\\" This would give a true picture of what their mission is.  I agree with this statement, but we cannot also accept what others say without looking into the issues.  That would be the same as taking  Suddan's discussion about the CIA, etc. as being true.  We must look at both sides.\",\"     You do mean disks, don't you, not tapes?  You forgot to say whether you were looking for the old 8\\\" or the newer 5.25\\\".

(No-one has said how it will be modulated - want a bet it's a non-standard and hence easily recognisable baudrate?)  Devices to scan exchanges and detect modems etc already exist.  I've seen them advertised in the trade press.  Once you eliminate crippled crypto devices and ordinary data modems, what's left is crypto worth looking more closely at.  I guess any substitute scheme will have to be v32bis or v.fast to disguise it, though then they just start looking at the data too...  Whatever happens though, the effect of this new chip will be to make private crypto stand out like a sore thumb.\",\" [...]  (the date I have for this is 1-26-93)  note Clinton's statements about encryption in the 3rd paragraph..

I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in \\\"contraceptive technology\\\" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.    Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't we teach \\\"safe drug use\\\" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it because we know that a class in \\\"how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs\\\" would increase drug use?  Why isn't \\\"drug abstinence education\\\" barred from schools because it teaches \\\"religion\\\"?  Aren't we abandoning those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe use?  \",\"We have recently purchased a Tektronix xterminal, and I'm having a problem with it.

JCAG and SDPA claim responsibility.   Source: Edward K. Boghosian, \\\"Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity Meeting,\\\" The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.  ATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties, including the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both Armenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the  Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.  The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of the Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of ASALA...  Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian people, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal... Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement  was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam  Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued  support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause,  pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be  open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr.  Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that  his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that this policy will continue. \\\"The doors of our camps are always open to  Armenian freedom fighters,\\\" he affirmed.  Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet; two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of the Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations, a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.  More than significant was the large number of messages received by the  organizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary Movement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.                   SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM  Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will continue to \\\"reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,\\\" to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag \\\"Bureau.\\\" The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement, open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.  The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the Greek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence. The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give   the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!  (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of  pages, please ask by sct)      I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924) What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your groundless accussations, etc.    [...]      I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)  and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published  in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you  are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..    Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)    First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You  called Serdar Argic a liar!..  I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...  (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)    And now, you are lying again and talking about \\\"modified,re-published book\\\" (without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..  (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was   first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty    well suited theories', as usual)    And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who  wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number  and page numbers again for the library use, which are:                    949.6 R 198       and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215                           Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying \\\"it is  not possible...\\\" ..If not, what is your point?    Differences in the number of pages?  Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..  No need to use the same book size and the same letter   charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!    The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year  first published..   And you tried to hide the whole point..  the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about  how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given   by Serdar Argic exist!!

Serdar Argic\",\" The only difference is the time the driver gets loaded. mouse.sys will be loaded during the config.sys and therefor before the command.com. mouse.com will be loaded during autoexec.bat and so after the command.com.   mouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and it could - perhaps - be unloaded, if no other driver is loaded after it. The working of both drivers is totally the same.  When I ran dos, I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat, because some programs won't run with some drivers and I could choose the ones I needed during startup. But with DRDOS6, this advantage is gone, because DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.  Michael\",\"  Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this approach.  It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences. The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case. You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits?  There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently, because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor- General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting.   Some people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating food that they have harvested themselves.

(I'm just assuming an Intel/Windows environment). Thanks in advance. --Jerry\",\"     I don't doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders. It's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology, and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, the proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what exists now.      The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs, probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say) a DES keysearch machine.      As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination could acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since it would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked jodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency or organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak- nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for (say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the complaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars to build a keysearch machine for.)      How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?  How about home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers? \\\"Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately. Maybe I can help...\\\"        Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistant to \\\"practical cryptanalysis.\\\"  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how several NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.  And NSA confidential data was *not* subject to being requested by thousands of police organizations and courts across the land.\",\"The DEA and other organizations would have the American people believe that we are winning the \\\"war on drugs\\\".  I'm going to dispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showing you the drug war's *real* status. To help prove my assertions I've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearly demonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on the rise.  If WOD is working, as we're led to believe, then drug abuse should have gone down substantially by now.  The reality is, is that it has not gone down very much.  If anything, substance abuse is on the rise.  I'm also going to supply a possible solution to this problem.  The following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music and pot entitled \\\"Hello Again, Mary Jane\\\" which appears in the current issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59).      Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing     smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed.  \\\"Perhaps     because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby     is out in full force,\\\" says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug     Enforcement Administration.  \\\"The fact is, they're losing the     battle.\\\"  In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said     they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner     says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that     studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of     nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.  The chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993 issue of USA Today (\\\"Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth-graders\\\" by Mike Snider, p. 6D).      Adolescents' choices      Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:                       Estimated, per 100 students                              1991     1992   Pct. chg.

I think you can see that one of the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that the \\\"war on drugs\\\" is being won is to selectively quote statistics--- only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone down.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is an excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to deceive the public.  Usage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same time usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution). Also, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down but drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore, if one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all* the statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called \\\"war on drugs\\\" is being lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs go, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants, then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed in its true perspective.  For those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then try drinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me that it's not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal* drugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless attempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to another drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.  The solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to legalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be within reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a few times) and then couple this with a massive drug education program. The reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution is because people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the government's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug interdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug education).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime because the profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often goes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact that addicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their money and posessions in order to support their expensive habit; legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall substantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.  IMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been done to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to employ heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating them.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less than they used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought about by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can light up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in order to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methods be used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried out.  They are as follows:      * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which       states the possible health hazzards involved with using this       product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.       Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used       ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.      * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of       revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs       through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from       drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law       enforcement.      * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of       18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the       taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.       Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning       information should also be a felony.      * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the       purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This       agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad       drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.  I'm sure that many of the things I've discussed in this article have been hashed out before in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, I thought it was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...) all at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand on WOD.  Go ahead and tear into my post; I'm sure there is something in it that you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :)  BTW, I posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove my assertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths--- something which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in.

Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants in the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.      The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them, including data from state and federal agencies.      The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the governments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a \\\"a massive spying operation.\\\"      The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.      Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.      The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that Gerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.      The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles.      The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California, which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources. It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as other unspecified damages.      Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his wife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.      One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence Minister.      Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.      According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both kept information on thousands of California political activists.      In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and Bullock received confidential information from the authorities.      No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing.   REUTER AC KG CM    APn  04/14 2202  ADL Lawsuit  Copyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.  By CATALINA ORTIZ  Associated Press Writer    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued the Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy by illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network.    The ADL, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, intended to use the data to discredit them because of their political views, according to the class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court.    \\\"None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hate crimes, or any of the other `isms' that the ADL claims to protect against. None of us is violent or criminal in any way,\\\" said Carol El-Shaieb, an education consultant who develops programs on Arab culture.    The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense Minister Moshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably because he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians.    \\\"The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks politically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite,\\\" Arens said.    The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit because it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL's New York headquarters.    The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that the ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including white supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco public television station KQED.    Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government records, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit. No charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.    The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law, which forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information \\\"not otherwise public\\\" from state or federal records.    The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to \\\"persons and entities\\\" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate.    Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL's office in San Francisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.    Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADL informant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard. Gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed information on to Bullock.    Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines. Bullock's lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit because he had not yet studied it.

One of the advantages and draw-backs of requiring proof on the part of the government before they may take action against citizens.  (and part of the reason some of us believe weapons should be available.)          We are not arguing the absolute sanctity of the U.S. Constitution.  In fact, the fillibuster we're talking about isn't *in* the Constitution.  I objected to your suggestion that the Senate wasn't intended to exercise the power it was clearly given.          I'll point out again that Reagan only had a Republican Majority in the Senate during his first term, and his coalition in the House came apart at about the same time.  Bush never had any real support in Congress.         The real point is that everybody, *everywhere* got their pork, from the big corporations to the guy I saw last night leaving a convenience store with an armful of junk-food he'd bought with food stamps.  (He spent more in food stamps on junk than I *make* in a week and I'm not on government assitance.)          Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.         In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billion dollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase of approx. 884 billion dollars.         In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In 192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars. That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccounted for.  (This represented an increase of 230%)         In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs, Housing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare) cost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, or more than national defense started.  (This represented an increase of 230%)         In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars on Medicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of 368%)         In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housing credits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.         In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billion dollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.         Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.         Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.         Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.         Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.         Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.         Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.              About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under  the Energy category, primarily under \\\"Supply,\\\" and \\\"Community Development,\\\" in the area of \\\"disaster relief,\\\" and between the two of them represent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.         Where *was* this huge diversion?          Not that's a stretch.  If the current government was pushed by the President to create this mess, wouldn't one expect it to begin to equalize once the pressure is gone?          Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want to continue. I see very little positive about it.          The Constitution was *designed* to frustrate the democratic process, so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting what they wanted by the time it happened.  Nor do I see putting the brakes on the \\\"democratic process\\\" an inherently bad thing.  Califronia's riding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense it gets worse.          Sometimes, or perhaps most of the time, the people should be told, \\\"no,\\\" and pointed to their local government.                 Phill, would you do me the very great favor of repeating that in talk.politics.guns?          Cute.  We can eliminate violations of the law by eliminating the law.          Free speech alone is dangerous, Phill.          OK, Phill.  All you gotta show me is a clear pattern of *reduction* in homicide rates across several countries and that'll be it.  (Not current, mind, you, reduction.)            Who's chaining anything to freedom of speech?  By *calling* it a freedom?            Phill, you're a master of subtly changing the subject.  I haven't *based* my argument against raw democracy on the Constitution.  I've tried to explain why it isn't a good idea.  The only time I've referred to the Constitution is to point out it doesn't contain the restrictions on the veto and the Senate you appear to believe were \\\"meant,\\\" but just didn't make it in there.              The Constitution doesn't *contain* the 41% fillibuster rule. I only believe that the rule is a good idea.  You cn't dismiss that as venerating the Constitution because it isn't *in* the Constitution.\",\"        Tennessee, at least, does not require any sort of safety class to get a driver's license.  All that is required is one twenty question quiz and to drive a car around the block without crashing.         In all probability, no you don't.  You are required to be licensed to drive on public roads.  A license is not necessary on private property.          Most states do not require the registration of cars that are not used on public roads.  Those that do (California I know of) do so for tax purposes more than anything else.              Many states do not currently require this, and most, again, only make this requirement for public roads.  A car sitting unused  is not required to have insurance.          The two are not the same, as I pointed out above.  There are significant difference between making rules for *use on public property* and *making rules for ownership*.         The other half of the objection is trust.  Similar things to this have been tried in many local jurisdications across the country, and have been abused in far too many cases.   Safety classes which are never sheduled, never funded, or only one or two is held a year for a limited number of participants.  Registration lists in New York, Chicago, and California have been used for confiscation.  *Many* gun owners would, in theory, support these planes.  (Although the numbers overwhelmingly show that competence is not the problem, that intentional misuse is).  They've simply seen it abused and are leery of the next person who comes down the pike with a \\\"reasonable\\\" suggestion they've already seen abused.    \",\"I just installed a new TrueType font under MS-Windows 3.1 but though all the applications display the font correctly on the screen, quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly (on a LaserJet 4 - non-PostScript printer).  When I use the font in CorelDRAW, the document prints correctly, so I assume CorelDRAW knows that the font has to be downloaded to the printer.  But when I use the Windows accessory Write, the printer prints square boxes in place of the characters of the new font. Yet, Write does display the font correctly on the screen.  I looked through all the Windows and LaserJet manuals, but got nowhere. All of them just make the statement that TrueType fonts will print exactly as you see them on the screen---so I assume Windows knows that a font has to be downloaded automatically---but, how to make it do that????\",\"MSG is common in many food we eat, including Chinese (though some oriental restaurants might put a tad too much in them).  I've noticed that when I go out and eat in most of the Chinese food restaurants, I will usually get a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards.  This happens to many of my friends and relatives too.  And, heh, we eat Chinese food all the time at home :) (but we don't use MSG when we're cooking for ourselves)  So, when we put one and one together, it can be safely assumed that MSG may cause some allergic reactions in some people.  Stick with natural things.  MSG doesn't do body any good (and possibly harms, for that matter).  So, why bother with it?  Taste food as it should be tasted, and don't cloud the flavor with an imaginary cloak of MSG.  -michael \",\"Dear friend,   The RISC means \\\"reduced instruction set computer\\\".

Nor would they have died if they had come out with their hands empty. That is undeniable truth.

My heart also bleeds for people so blinded by religious devotion  to not have the common sense to leave the compound when tanks came up  and started dropping in tear gas early in the morning.

Neat cars, fun to drive.  Sold through Buick from 196? through 1973 (if I remember correctly).  I believe it was in '72 that there were some engine mods made such that parts were not interchangeable with the older models.  Parts are thus much harder to come by for the later models.  Parts in general are not too difficult to find.  At one time JC Whitney carried some stuff including a brand new (not remfg) long block.

I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted Flakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.  Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think \\\"Oh, oh, this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.\\\"  Ten  minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.  When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even he is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when a person has a seizure.  Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you can guess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there has.  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get across what is going on here.  Thanks.       \",\"Yes, I know it's nowhere near Christmas time, but I'm gonna loose Net access in a few days (maybe a week or 2 if I'm lucky), and wanted to post this for interested people to save 'till Xmas.   :-( Note: Bell Labs is a good place IF you have a PhD and a good boss, I have neither. --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Subject: Xmas light set with 2 levels of brightness  Another version of a variable brightness Xmas light set: This set starts with a 2 blinker 35 bulb string.    DIAGRAM:  orginal 2 way set  120v---+--b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!        !---b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!                            ! 120rtn_____________________!  modified set for 2 level brightness:                  string 1 120v---------*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!   \\\\_10K_______*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!     5w    !      string 2     !           b   ________________! 120v rtn__!___!               ^ Note: no mods to wiring to the right of this point.  Only one blinker is used.  Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the string 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in parallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing and the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open, this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.   Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get one.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these draw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.  What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light  at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current  from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing  both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a  low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow  at reduced brightness. \",\" How can we resist a questions that says something like this?   If your Expose event handler is truly intelligent about exposed rectangle information, then you can use XClearArea to generate an Expose event (assuming that your background pixel is not None) for the enclosing rectangle of your new item.  This is still not great, since any other items contained within that rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn.  If your Expose event handler simply redraws everything, you'll be doing much more work than just drawing the new item \\\"on top\\\" of the existing scene. \",\"Regarding David Wilkerson's prophecies.  While I'm not real sure of his credibility, I do remember a book he wrote, called A VISION or something like that.  He made a prediction that people who bought gold would be hurt financially.  At the time, gold was up to about $800; now it is less than half that.  This prediction stuck in my mind because a lot of people where I worked were buying gold.  The problem is, we tend to remember predictions that come true and forget ones that didn't (a la Jean Dixon).  Does anyone know if there any of his predictions, perhaps from the book I mentioned, that can pretty definitely be said to have not come true?\",\"Just a little something I found while reading the Village Voice, which is not noted for its sports coverage, but occasionally the print some interesting features.  This year, the predictions/team analyses for the 1993 season were presented in the form of Bob Dylan lyrics.

Daevid Bornhuetter-Machen, The Madison Edge  \\\"The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that  Hitler was original and showed initiative.\\\"  --Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show, ABC Radio Network,  October 27, 1992.  (NLNS)--Believe it or not, I was planning this comparative review of  Mein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant, The Way Things Ought to  Be before Sahl issued his comparative review. As usual, Sahl's was  independent and sharp as a scalpel.  My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At  least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the  idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for  delivery.  Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the  most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are  noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with  passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in  fact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost  identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German  election). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and  enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their  ideological quilt.  The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening  pages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the  German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway  line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923)  was \\\"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\\\" when  there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.  In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as  the Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost  succeeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic  claim in his introduction that \\\"in a school or during a commencement  ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\\\" Of  course, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of  God against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is  too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.  Of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books,  my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern  American Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version  of Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925),  and trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen  million followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book  after building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in  Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.  Thus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily  three-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary  propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way  Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a  translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the  printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since  radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of  luxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to  spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop  $22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.  But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some  cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of  their propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these  days.)  Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf  Hess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of  ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio  program's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk  show, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He  knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows  that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the  opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh  earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a  RICO indictment.  On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of  material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For  example:  On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society  Hitler: \\\"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who  individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly  perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in  order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of  imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight  for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of  thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\\\"  (page 577).  Limbaugh: \\\"Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The  show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \\\"with half my  brain tied behind my back to make it even\\\"] denotes the egress of mental  aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree  with me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media  will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking  and screaming all the way.\\\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)  On Religion as the Basis of a Nation  Hitler: \\\"In this world human culture and civilization are  inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his  decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without  culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord  sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the  expulsion from Paradise.\\\" (Page 581.)  Limbaugh: \\\"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ...  But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or  ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a  charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools  for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of  American education has declined ever since?\\\" (pages 274-5.)  On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse  Hitler: \\\"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ...  One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and  theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ...  Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays  must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the  service of a moral idea of State and culture.\\\" (pages 346 and 348.)  Limbaugh: \\\"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that  Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people  who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality  and monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\\\" (page 254.)  On the News Meida  Hitler: \\\"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of  gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass  by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the  people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of  slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\\\" (Page 331.)  Limbaugh: \\\"Elements of The Media have jumped on the  bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been  replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During  the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global  network. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't  realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that  therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided  and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania.\\\" (pages 270 and 268.)  *     *     *   To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but  ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.  After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that  haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened  Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed  Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s,  Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to  depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American  radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the  Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for  The Fascist States of America.  And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the  radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate.

Data files should be examined and repaired.   You're not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky stuff in a PC environment.   A reasonably accurate prediction...   Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files:  There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain, and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.  The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size, and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not important right now.  The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find the actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it holds a \\\"magic\\\" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad (unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file.  The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored. The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is doled out in \\\"chunks\\\" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster is 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.  To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster. Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file. Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump around and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a time, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker which says it's the last cluster in the file.  CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into submission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to double-check anything it \\\"fixes\\\".  Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:   All of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match the size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter the directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long. But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers, obviously, are made up.))   Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached to any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these \\\"lost chains\\\" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK through FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply be marked \\\"available\\\" in the FAT.    ...   These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously, one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that C:\\\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...  To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name. This will \\\"fix\\\" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces. Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to assemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  \\\"Missing pieces\\\" are likely to be found in those \\\"lost chains\\\" at the top...)   Your disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of the problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space...  In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT. There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the problem occurs.

For instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain blanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actually performed the action isn't the murderer (but I guess this is actually made clear in the below definition).   What do you mean by \\\"reasonable?\\\"  [...]  Yes, it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition.  But, even though the series is recursively infinite, I think the meaning can still be deduced.   [math lesson deleted]  Okay, let's look at this situation:  suppose there is a longstanding feud between two families which claim that the other committed some travesty in the distant past.  Each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family.  Now, let's suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you don't like dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, there is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty. How do you resolve this?  Well, they are all murders.  Now, I suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your \\\"problem,\\\" but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.  And, in any case, the nested \\\"murderer\\\" in the definition of murder cannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity. And, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition?  See, in a totally objective system where all the information is available, such a nested definition isn't really a problem.\",\"   I found the MS defrag looks very much like Norton Speedisk.

I would describe myself as an agnostic, in so far as I'm sure there is no single, universal supreme being, but if there is one and it is just, we will surely be judged on whether we lived good lives, striving to achieve that goodness that is within the power of each of us.  Now, the complication is that one of my best friends has become very fundamentalist.  That would normally be a non-issue with me, but he feels it is his responsibility to proselytize me (which I guess it is, according to his faith).  This is a great strain to our friendship.  I would have no problem if the subject didn't come up, but when it does, the discussion quickly begins to offend both of us: he is offended because I call into question his bedrock beliefs; I am offended by what I feel is a subscription to superstition, rationalized by such circular arguments as 'the Bible is God's word because He tells us in the Bible that it is so.'  So my question is, how can I convince him that this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preserve what is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a great friendship?  How do I convince him that I am 'beyond saving' so he won't try?  Thanks for any advice. \",\"Since I've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gateways lately on here, I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences. My machine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in.      Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the  peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway  documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals. The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office) was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and  has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a  lot to do with it.      It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications.  I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then \\\"maps\\\" the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can \\\"cd\\\" to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the  peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.     My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!    So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it was me.

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and  Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses  each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin  June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours  per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.   Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact  Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below.   ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.        ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## #######################################################################               JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon  University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:  1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.   FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

Further, funding is resticted to US citizens and permanent residents of the US.\",\" I'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.  Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I actually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.  I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to invest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then I also passed my road test.  On May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a 4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb), I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late, skidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under a car and been killed.  Now this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff as I did.  So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until you're ready to use it.   While you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in DC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you save up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear, plus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure the machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up machine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration and licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.   I pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200 in Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be poor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo more expensive.   There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle magazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or recent models might be available.  You could probably look through past issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice instead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around and they were generally set up the way I wanted.  Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping, were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence cheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\",\"begin 644 outOfControl.gif M1TE&.#=AN@*6`?```````/___RP`````N@*6`0`\\\"_@Q@J)O-[XQ4#IYX::Z3 M9PUB4ZAY9`<NY59*:/!2L0C-J^W>2(>?[-C3Q70,6A`H9)&2OA=*ELQ)?RW+ MP3HT5F%1RQ%INGZNVMF4&WR0?4+>\\\"OO!,-7(-SO,K#^I=2_<=J?4,QB(`X-V MN)-X>+;C1^B&UI7C&#E)=7E&F)?9\\\"?9X`OEH.77CE(*I!5KI^08H-I8PMC9: M26HW\\\"RLFN]LK>@NH1PN[UT>YQ,&ETL#[)#=BVO0<ZZ=VB7S=**D)!?G+\\\\]M& M%`[<2MY]$=[*JFW8V>6ZYHSZG6V.#DVZ-XS?[8*X:`@M6;SB;5M'<\\\"\\\"U3VS& M-5E5J-JT8)P<%>&#$=I#_CH2O40*\\\")#=/6\\\\.3QW,(JY,IB,C4[6\\\\-Y(EPTW\\\" MRIP[*:AB'X>Z/\\\"K2MV5805T:/YD@28G&LIQ+AVY,6$%G\\\"@]4X]\\\"SVM2:THGS M;MIJ$9)1/W<AO'I]-S%F2S-!SU9URXFBW))7N[95E!'4W*':5+CZ*(/;W+'R M\\\\DK9Q-$HUH4/56*+.C5K6L<'$V-%*>HQQ\\\\O,P.+#:7>0RLJAS:+]LW:2Z:BC M8:KK.QAQW-2FK;+MR><?(Y-X<1:V,YEVQXB1;5\\\\&'E$.J]\\\\S>\\\\7;$!RSY7G2 MTGT]+%:WZW&B]=*%2U.U2(3>*<)[FRUT68-87I>_N_I:3DF2`\\\\/^UWLI1I^) M_L:?@]D18E6AIMQ1A2F6T&S-074@3R+(%$5V]ODCDGI(I71:=_&)UYHJL#4H M3(`U\\\",?67N?A@B!A$:18FQ$%O;C%;B>!4Z$OF!!(8BF**:21?@8.J(1++A5H MV&:118><=*PEEY^,$X)&6V;DL.B=@E)&.>1W[/&&TGL,;>FC<<:(R1]\\\\C9'G M!(.Y(1(-2,4YZ$]G5)H()7U!PHACBDQ5)I6<EH%YHD)P>,EDFF\\\"5XV&&U=G4 MD'KV:*C@HW0-Y^<V%FY7(G?[04E,F_;DV>\\\"??74*VF'7L4E=@N8IF1&5[&'S MVW%^018<8Q)-8YT5KQ[G!IAIK\\\"7A;KZ2Z%ELSUFZ_DI\\\\RI)W47@6+:@HA`DV M&DJ1ITK*:K,_X->K4=P\\\"I!M@-5Z:#YV>*IDH9$%N.I^DQ>F)WFS'+E83<GEA MB.I/)H4W)X>I601%I+PM9VZEPVXU+WA%FANP>U_86.>_CG(Y[KG<ZFO+*_RP MVJ^6'!-,%#6S=)D/O3:^:F#\\\"@9+\\\\W%\\\\W3A?AC,`@BF^U_\\\";9\\\\,+$+BMPGR]) MZS%S/&8YAXH2[ZP5Q#*&&Z.F8[);C,A0P3CUH&&HNZZJQ*#'Z9Z1Z@=KO7;A ME300BSP+8K`7GPTMM@9=60Z[)_+<6L^IPMGOCJ7B[0Q-SB)-,=<4^L9,6/\\\"M M'6*]I)(Y<7VQXIIR3R4G_FY-5B+#K)G-FMV-VLI>#UXLC0I/;F;!N08>](:- M2_=4EF.O&G3J3)YY,^H(&UOBAXP*FQUV`OJ5\\\"NQZUR65D24_[C6#I(L-XIVZ MQKLDN;1OF;OANB>)**>9.MPNDM,;&RVA>;]T\\\\-RN?U^TSH\\\";\\\\FU^K5[7Y/7* M_RF4<T[E$J;D(Y.)2\\\\AAW[N9`0GN;M#C%?^X%S5W:()M<(D=D1*X'N)`2WH_ M`A30;J>HZ55I>/!26<5^!9C:X2R$WQH5?[03+E,QC&I#XY,!*Z<4>RTI:?LS MTE7PQC\\\\8BDI(QZ!.0T0TL_B!2WRE:U%7E,&Z\\\"Y4F?'GP$/.26)+Y(5!>4FSB M_ODL`1W&?<U\\\"[0O(D5(\\\"CAGMBC3/RYE3=G*_,\\\\8J:_B;UCXHUR[@=7\\\"'-)RC M#SL&P5J@$%D1&YWG(\\\"B_[FD1:!MYS\\\\^&Y2X.;E%E'^M0``_904.A2FQFX-U/ M,$8?\\\\`UF5V#KT<MZY\\\"C@C<B*D&O$(Q>YA'LEXXJ)>1`F[V.W]!`1B4$13HZJ M()]9GL^`BJ2;EM#'LQ9N+D#54UN^=B@:9$7#<X1B(Z[X8;]FH**-SGGAY1K' MR#J6[UTMBV';.H2=^`&S#2SBG-%,IS/*G,9\\\\BD03BJ!&H$:R,S>3>@44L2G) M4NUM1(;@7>_DF3(*DJ$H]A-EYJ0YOQH&4!6G;,XH_L=&0_35R$RJ*6'&)CH^ MN0CH%+Q$&2Y?]QV!T/*>533=E,J7KEC:\\\\V`T8QRD9&G16S2O'ERLA6W$2$#C MI!(WB[G<-$TFJS)\\\"CHYJ<J,9=>J8>39R@9($H[_V=D&4EDT>VSLJDM3I1POB M,\\\"WH.)/;1C5%A&)0H/OJ#=MF]=5)BE.!TS'E$R-Z/VLJ1X;&\\\"X0$M[I!M![T MHX.DW=HNR30=-?,_BA/L^HPHCD+!+*4@S:A'+[78>HY%'04=Z3D7%A;$B?2R M3$7;*E=J2_WEL)IJS$5IU4C0,$5/:,W+GS2IJL&7LC6?:J-6'XE5NBQ\\\"2IX^ M@YL@'4E(DQ*S9YP]%\\\\[,_H%0ZU`P=W$B'&,X&,(*`==%YK,A'G\\\"37+[P,PZ6 M]&#?D!I'2OE,5B4][KB8ZT6#M<AE@K,2/<DZ3A,I-FJZ]*U7WQ))MDIUMMX% ME8;2:[3ZKBA?WC(N4/*81LMY\\\\F0)[531/`FDU2ZO2O-R[4K0])$]=I5BARV3 M+Q\\\\82T@6]S^'_&H_PI>I^!9ON\\\\YM4^\\\\\\\"8^!WP+BQ)HN;`.O3)6C&58Z\\\"RJWH M>-C1U':RL@<4$A$?BZ\\\\,?]\\\"=`AVF?0%*18FNIX`)317G5/?(`2X3N)Z@+'OM MMJ_H\\\"D].W-C64`E;U%/R-+PAFY8.9:PU03[%B>\\\"]B.8<FAD/[Y'`8$;N?.LK M_CN5\\\"@S*!*'Q\\\\;`HPFT:3)6\\\\Q>UF'4M\\\"$VKQ>2Z2])I=6E<W]SBUK\\\\4NV%2[ MK5,IH\\\\Z?BW.FLTS>SD$YR>R@V4E=-59AMFZ%O]T?)4&%.4?Z-UE$$R[+&%OJ M/SIYQ-?R78TQ&K.<&11B?0WH&C6MOQFV6<X&SFDU!!5);;+,KIBY\\\"0GA]V%W MP@/9EO5U8_!8R-6A6LF0OK.*VXMN$6ML14!4ZXM'O>-W:G4?U;PTCY?M;_SY M;\\\\':O;&#!WI1ZTE-JT,&\\\\JY_[4\\\"]I%>%A$FG*B4[V$D+[^(8?+C5\\\\%K=;$'V MT$4V]W(%/5,7JY\\\"/Q_`T3P`=\\\\#4CN-\\\\R[S&#+TTK_H0KK1TU].$T;_Q&N4&Q MOS4#EZ7X#%\\\\L$_:F%?-XK9J\\\\;>9Y>+Y)/T]2>EWRR$;=6EJC*>A\\\\$W-HAMU_ M-5]VOGGZVK-/.^PTKM_VR.C@M'>3:-I4L'@SMZBOAQ2(LV9X!6?>;NI*EI:.

Question is that the '91 TSi AWD was mentioned in the April Consumer Reports to a car to avoid!  In particular, the manual transmission, electrical system, and brakes were below par (in both models).  A friend of mine ownes a '90 TSi AWD and he has had 2 brake jobs (pads), one stuck valve, and some clutch/transmission problem, something about sticking/grinding into second gear.  This doesn't seem too bad if one \\\"beats\\\" on his car.  I am willing to suffer reliability--for speed and looks.  Seems you have to pay big buck if you want all three.  Anyway can anyone please let me know how you like your Talon, and any problems you may have had, and if the repairs are worth it.  Thanks for any responses!\",\" While I agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding, I disagree strongly with your original point. The point of formal training  must be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion to know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike  in a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular. Countersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among  new bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the  motorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the direction opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous. I have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she is to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the  motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right  handle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road.  A worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn the rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.  The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency  situations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) of countersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.\",\"I am testing IDEA block cipher implementations for correctness and needs some golden test vectors.

There are still a lot of languages without the Bible, or a part of the Bible. There are still many languages which we are not able to write, simply because the written version of the language has not yet been defined!  I guess this is one of the main goals for Wycliffe Bible Translators: To define rules and a grammar for writing the 'rest' of the languages of this world. I do not see that any of them will have any reason to become unemployed during the foreseeable future. (Provided they get their neccessary support!)

The bike has about 47,000 miles : and is around $4500. It has had two previous owners, both employees : of the dealership who, I have been told, took very good care of the : bike.  : I have two questions: 1) Is this too many miles for a bike? I know this : would not be many miles for a car but I am unfamiliar with the life : span of bikes. 2) Is this a decent price? I am also unfamilar with : prices for used bikes. Is there a blue book for bikes like there is : for cars?.  : Thanks for any advice you can give.  :                             --Mark --  Mark,    47k is not too many miles on a VFR750.  I sold my (well maintained) '87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition. All that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings and seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers to look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was mint.     As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800. There is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price. I've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all said low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.     A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain it at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my VFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot. Progressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.

Surely the whole point of all this madness is to make Joe Public think that his/her communications will be kept safe, while James Bond at the NSA can, if need be, have full, decrypted access to someone's communications?

As Daryl points out, Markus won't be joining the Pens for this year's  playoffs, since the World Championships starts April 18th.   But there is a good chance that Markus will join the Pens before next  season. MoDo, though, naturally wants to keep their superstars Forsberg  and Naslund, so the latest news on this is that MoDo is looking for  personal sponsors for Forsberg and Naslund in order to match the kind  of money they would receive in NHL.

It is Mats Sundin and  Calle Johansson that Curt hopes can join the team, although in a late  stage of the tournament.

Thanks, Jason\",\"  As a libertarian (with a small l) who voted for Clinton, I think that he should abolish the Selective Service and the draft.  If his conscience forbade him to go to war in Vietnam, it should forbid him to perpetuate this system of government-sanctioned slavery.   If our government would pay attention to SERIOUS domestic issues (the ECONOMY) and choose to stay out of other people's wars (Iraq, Bosnia, Somalia), we would not be in this fix.  An anyway, couldn't the jobs be replaced by improving our domestic situation?  (I'm not for continued deficit spending, but if Clinton and Congress want to spend, I'd rather they improve the  infrastructure than fight other people's wars.)   A novel idea:  Getting away from naval bases, what about refurbishing decommissioned Air Force bases as airports?  This would be SO much cheaper than building them from the ground up (Denver's new airport is one of the  most appalling examples of pork-barreling and cronyism I have seen in my lifetime).  Even if no more airports are needed, I'm sure Bill Gates or Ross Perot would LOVE to have their own private airfields, and the money from their purchases could be applied to the public debt. \",\" Actually detecting a BREAK is done by watching for a \\\"character\\\" containing all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt.

The probe was launched into this region for the earth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow down. The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without expending fuel, we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible\\\". The originator of the technique said that NASA wasn't interested, but that Japan was because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel for deceleration.

The problem in this case is at least as bad as that of trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary experience.  One can get some rough understanding, but the language is, from the perspective of ordinary phenomena, inconsistent, and from the perspective of what's being described, rather inexact (to be charitable).  An analogous situation (supposedly) obtains in metaphysics; the problem is that the \\\"better\\\" descriptive language is not available.

So, only the correct key(s) would reveal the presence of an \\\"illegal\\\" document.

Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started  with a solid single to right, moved to second on \\\"Bob\\\" Kelly's infield sneaker down the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a  rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.  Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only  given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double by Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after Joe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who  argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by \\\"drawing the line\\\" (really, he should know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting tossed.  The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must  have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's single, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell and turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson failed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:  Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly: Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended. (Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)  The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's ground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back singles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long fly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was hung out to dry killing the Reds rally.  Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game in late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended up walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a  week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went to Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings work, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit surprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.  The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory today.

No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.  I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I haven't seen IDE drives cheaper.  : The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card : (or PGA?) was $800.

No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read: easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.  : I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented : data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better : (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when : managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.  On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:  A (partial?) list:  1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them   concurrently.  2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac  and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice  with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)  3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For  instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor  212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will  work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the  termination, plug it in, and away it goes.  4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that  the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is  quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:  to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very  noticable, as many things can be going on at once.  One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card.    Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.

I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, just have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and   muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent  irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep,  wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the  spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot, and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 \\\" apart.)  This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.

What is important is HOW they are used, and what            else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )             (1) THE 7-DAY FAST.                 1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind            at a time, preferably grapes.                 2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half            raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape            clean the intestinal linings.                 3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice            you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune            juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from            concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to            your home bathroom.)                 4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and            dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS            CONTAIN LAETRILE.).                 5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from            two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and            add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).             Drink one glass per hour.           [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day            every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH            PULP.]                 6th day: Same as 5th day.                 7th day: Same as 6th day.                 All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each            day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements,            plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.             (2) THE GRAPE DIET.                 Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to            8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the            six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.                   (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.                Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple            cider \\\"flavored\\\" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a            glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.             Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a            week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal            healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially            effective against those types of cancer that resemble a            FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections.                     (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]                Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level            comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.             Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely            dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt            (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda.                 Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising            your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your            stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down,            chomping your teeth together, etc..                 Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes            the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the            book \\\"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\\\", by Frances Nixon, 1973.                 PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should            prepare it and drain it.           For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away            from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly            expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt            other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at            least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.             (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take            a 2-Billion-bacteria \\\"Acidophilus\\\" capsule, which is also an            EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \\\"A.I.D.S.\\\"            (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the            digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune            system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal            bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \\\"Lyme disease\\\".]           Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder            storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \\\"Major\\\" or            \\\"Minor Periods\\\" as listed in the \\\"Solunar Tables\\\" published            bimonthly in \\\"Field & Stream\\\" Magazine, (because of the            measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields            present at those times).           Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year.                    (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES:                         For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the                 affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons                 per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for                 about 2 months.                          D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to                 perform NORMAL cell functions.                  ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.                  To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.                  To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per                 day.                [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.                  IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer                 cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile                 into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is                 ALSO present in the digestive system.)]                  ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include                 Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most                 people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A                 (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide                 Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up                 to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-                toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime                 will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types),                 suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes,                 prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not                 cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST                 \\\"A.I.D.S.\\\", which is really a form of cancer similar to                 leukemia.]  (See the book \\\"Life Extension\\\", by Durk                 Pearson and Sandy Shaw.)                  HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3%                 hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably                 DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day,                 hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.                  Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers                 several times per day.                Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good                 daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants                 described above.                  VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and                 much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA                 doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources.                  Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell)                 NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on                 and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an                 aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-                radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with                 daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH                 magnetic fields.                  Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES                 can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well                 as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics                 Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos                 of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays!                  INTERFERON tablets.                 TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho).                             HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical                 problems (even drug addiction!).                  50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure                 prostate trouble.                  This list is NOT exhaustive.              The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-           DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent            and cure many other medical problems including heart-           diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work            effectively.             Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these            remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send            a strong message to one's subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it            to CURE the cancer.             In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer,            then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies            described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast),            BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations            and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer            treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!].

Instead, I wrote to Bentsen.  My letter was not exactly strongly-worded; I simply stated that the BATF approach was immoral (military-style assault, firing into a house where they knew there were kids).  Aparently, Bentsen forwarded my letter to the BATF and they responded to  me directly.  It follows the text of your reply pretty closely.  However, I intend to send another letter directly to them, in return.   This section is not in the letter that I received.  The parts about ATF logo and steenking badges or their loss of the element of surprise were not included, either.

They were acting in direct contradiction to scripture.  Jesus' Second Coming is something that everyone will know of.  Jesus also predicted that there will be false Messiahs who will use His name.  His prophecy has been fulfilled.   I agree with you there.    Me too.  I have already given my life to God.  If God tells me to lay down my life, it will be to save another life.    Do you judge all Christians by the acts of those who would call themselves Christian and yet are not?  The BD's contradicted scripture in their actions.  They were NOT Christian.  Simple as that.  Perhaps you have read too much into what the media has portrayed.  Ask any true-believing Christian and you will find that they will deny any association with the BD's.  Even the 7th Day Adventists have denied any further ties with this cult, which was what they were.  Do you judge all Muslims by the acts committed by Saddam Hussein, a  supposedly devout Muslim?  I don't.  Saddam is just a dictator using the religious beliefs of his people to further his own ends.

Maybe not precisely, but well enough to know if you should let him around before you try to pass.  I know what you are talking about, about the other driver being startled, because i myself have been startled by drivers cruising by at around 90-100mph when i'm doin 55-65.  The problem, though, as i saw it, was not their fault for barreling around me, but my fault for not paying the attention to my task-at-hand that i should have been. Oddly enough, since the 2nd time(happened 2x in around 4 mo. when i'd had my liscence for around 6 mo), i haven't been startled..and i've been passed by cars doing roughly twice the speed of my car.  Another odd occurance is the fact that this only seems to happen on LONG trips...and if i drive along with them, it doesn't happen at all :-) even on the long trips! :-)  (adrenaline will do that to you...i've had bad cop experiences with speeding, so anything over the limit is adrenalizing for me...scared i'll get caught :-)  Maybe they should raise the limit, so we can pay better attention.....  just curious, and my .otwo\",\"   Agreed.  --          \\\"Satan and the Angels do not have freewill.

Unless you have an accident, you won't need more.  If you plan on paying for the car with a credit card, check and see if your card automatically covers rental cars.  Also, your own auto insurance may cover rental cars also.  Most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent, and require you to initial in several spots if you don't want it.  The credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of coverage that the rental agency is trying to sell.  I have never rented from Alamo, so I don't know if they follow this same practice.  Yes.  It is a compact 2-door, probably a bit dull performance and acceleration-wise, but very adequate.

If they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and force compression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).  If you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend into,  then drag is reduced.

This person instead has posted one of the worst arguments I have ever seen made from the pro-Christian people.  I've known several Jesuits who would laugh in his face if he presented such an argument to them.  Let's ignore the fact that it's not a true trilemma for the moment (nice word Maddi, original or is it a real word?) and concentrate on the liar, lunatic part.  The argument claims that no one would follow a liar, let alone thousands of people.  Look at L. Ron Hubbard.  Now, he was probably not all there, but I think he was mostly a liar and a con-artist.  But look at how many thousands of people follow Dianetics and Scientology.  I think the  Baker's and Swaggert along with several other televangelists lie all the time, but look at the number of follower they have.  As for lunatics, the best example is Hitler.

(Around 5 MB.)  I have a Quadra 950.  I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.          (using block-mode transfers) I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can          achieve 6.8 MB/s.  Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.  It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer, then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)  So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer,   Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer. Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer. Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.         ... Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer. Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.  Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously, and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho') each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.  Why?  Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time.) Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use the same bus to mac RAM?  Is there anything I can do?\",\" I'm not sure about Juha, but another top center, Rauli Raitanen([ss{t) is drafted by Jets. Raitanen had very good year and he has played in the Finnish nationalteam.

Presumably only recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention. The necessity it refers to has always been there, but it's been implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of the new window.   [...]  This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a border-pixel, and the problem should go away.  There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.

Sigh.  Another naive illusion down the toilet....      ----- Tommy McGuire mcguire@cs.utexas.edu mcguire@austin.ibm.com\",\"I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of mite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years (since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained from painful experience:    1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.      Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more      sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.    2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear      that these things will itch for months.    3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of      it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,      since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could      find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special      collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is      required to get it.    4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old      folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall      reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers      burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I      think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some      sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.    5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.      A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally      applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is      another preparation called \\\"Chig Away\\\" that is a combination of      sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was      prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In      the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get      up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we      live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They      apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur      as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)    6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget      the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment      that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone      creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine      (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.      Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this      counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think      it gains nothing).    7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved      by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery      as well.  Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money.\",\"Heya all, I've got a pair of Oakley forsale  There are frogskins, with aurborn red.

Is it transmitted periodically in the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does the phone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever, or tries it to turn them into voice-output ? (Which would not be disturbing)    Second question: Why!?!? Why is such a strange procedure used, and not a real RNG ? This turns those S1,S2 in a kind of bottleneck for system- security.    So no (technical) provision will be taken to place a 'timeout' on these warrants? This would be a unique possibility to realize such a technical restriction, by letting the escrow-agencies perform the decoding of the session key. Just take modem-lines instead of secure fax.

It's a very biblical doctrine as Romans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church has always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free will.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also affected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and Jansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4).  For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect, who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those without that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need it, as they had freely chosen hell.          ^^^^^^^^^^^ People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own effort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined them to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were deserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.   Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little), for those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And those He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one or in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal punishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it (cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder were forgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I need not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is quite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from the Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira, Jerusalem in 70 AD, etc.  not a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we not >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more  We should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the U.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an isolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in the case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved, it would not be a \\\"just war.\\\"  \\\"Blessed\\\" after all, \\\"are the peacemakers\\\" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Our actions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us.\",\" I haven't seen any speculation about it. But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau)  was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost payload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from 2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competing with the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except now I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the  successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the early results are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in  Russia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue  their development.   The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton  is 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-D which sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know about launch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which are probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake things up pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragile thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now. Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know  how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track and erected on the pad?    They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads  (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the US at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are political problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention. \",\"I went to Staples in Framingham, MA, today, and grabbed the info-sheet on the 450 bundle.

About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes  under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement  of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of  the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced  the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor   suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.   While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being   manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently  increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (  palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part  the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had  been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the  pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is   persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3  and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides  minor reductions in pain and is only short term.     My questions are:        Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the      levels of pain?       Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?       Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?     Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.         Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.

I spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently,  by coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that  while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the  Church as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church  recoginizes itself as a community of believers, members of the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable to each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island, there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without the priest being present, but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area.     I remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus, married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the community.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with one another--the community should be able to rely on that  couple to be as one.   While couples may marry without witnesses, they  may NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An  anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage at all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half-hour later!!   I tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage, but I would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they intended to be married, assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a commitment, I believe, in God's eyes.   But I'm digressing....     God be with you,\",\"Okay, let's suppose that the NSA/NIST/Mykotronix Registered Key system becomes standard and I'm able to buy such a system from my local radio shack. Every phone comes with a built in chip and the government has the key to every phone call.  I go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key.   What's to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or  buying a used phone at a garage sale? Whooa. The secret registered keys just became unsynchronized. When the government comes  to listen in, they only receive gobbledly-gook because the  secret key registered under my name isn't the right one.   That leads me to conjecture that:  1) The system isn't that secure. There are just two master keys that work for all the phones in the country. The part about registering your keys is just bogus.   or   2) The system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks like this.

I thought you were gonna buy a BMW for its superior power and handling... \",\" Kratz comments above show otherwise.   Bingo - now the question is, does the Glock's qualify?  Let's see the evidence that Kratz uses.   But first an aside.  Having an air gun proves nothing.  Moreover, my comments are based on what Kratz writes.  He's free to argue that he babbles in text but actually knows something off-line.   Harder than what?  I note that almost all revolvers work the same way, so it can't be \\\"harder than revolvers\\\".   Sure they can.  (Moreover, we know now that Kratz' sample is unrepresentative.)  We can look at the reasoning.  It is basically \\\"these Glocks are dangerous because they're not like my 1911/S&W third generation.\\\"  Part of that is true, but since those same people don't claim that revolvers, which share the relevant property, are dangerous, we see that the argument fails.   Why would I care?  I'm not looking for more bogus reasoning.   One can make hundreds of simple statements without having anyone \\\"getting right on your ass\\\".

The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be depressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just about (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working correctly is totally drop safe.  Now, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single documented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because he failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely prevented the office from getting shot.  The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire. This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down intentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a 'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else. By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece. From the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of firing it.  The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be familiar with that particular type of firearm.\",\" Does this organization have an official e-mail address these days?

Let's check Mr. Cain's facts a bit, shall we?    FACT:  It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license to do so from PKP, whether or not one is charging for it.  Furthermore, any use of RSA, other than for research purposes allowed under US patent law, is similarly unlawful.  Therefore, the \\\"average citizen\\\" cannot use RSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP.  There is no licensed, freely available product in the US that uses RSA encryption other than RSAREF (and hence RIPEM), at least as far as I am aware.  If you know of another, please post it here.   FACT:  The last contact I had with RSA Data Security, Inc was with some guy trying to sell me a license (unsolicited, I might add) for TIPEM. Cost: $15K plus 2-5 percent royalties.  I suppose it is a matter of opinion as to whether or not these terms count as \\\"mucho bucks\\\" or \\\"incredibly reasonable.\\\"  Either way, however, this definitely falls into the \\\"routines *they* tell you to (use)\\\".   FACT:  There are no restrictions (yet!) on the use of cryptography under US law, although this is beginning to look like it will change.  The only impediments to widespread use of RSA cryptography in the US are PKP's patents.

When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this       menu you can press any function key except F5. If you move or copy       files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like       'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory. +       The header line in 'read' menu includes \\\"(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)\\\". +         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.       pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use         for reading current file.       pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This         program will automatically determine which format this file is.         The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check         standard extension. Still fail, report error.       pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.         If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key           (except ESCAPE).         If any error occurs, program will make a beep.         ESCAPE to terminate.       pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.       pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.     2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.       Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.       pressing RETURN: show image.         in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text         mode.       pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do         special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.       pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.       pressing SPACE: save current image to file.

This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image         to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program         will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another         directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after         pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change         directory to what you want. Then,          pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.         pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename                       (filename under bar).     3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.    4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,      the performance is poor.    5. If you want to save 8 bits image :        try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...       If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):        try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster        (No one is better for true 24bits image)    6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.    7. Not all subroutines are fully tested    8. This document is not well written.

I am trying to set up a Conner 3184 and a Quantum 80AT drive.  I have the conner set to the master, and the quantum set to the slave (doesn't work the other way around).  I am able to access both drives if I boot from a  floppy, but the drives will not boot themselves.  I am running MSDOS 6, and have the Conner partitioned as Primary Dos, and is formatted with system files.  I have tried all different types of setups, and even changed IDE controller cards.  If I boot from a floppy, everything works great (except the booting part :)).  The system doesn't report an error message or anything, just hangs there.

In April  1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A  number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian Paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku. Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the creation of an Armenian SS formation in order   \\\"to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the   spirit of the Nazi ideas.\\\"  He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]  [1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106. [2] Enno Meyer, A. J. Berkian, 'Zwischen Rhein und Arax, 900     Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen,' (Heinz Holzberg     Verlag-Oldenburg 1988), pp. 124 and 129.   The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any  official position. His views were represented by his men in the respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942. Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after a long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1]   A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not 'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy. As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August  1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.  [1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., pp. 112-113.  Need I go on?

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the system key   2) Recieve Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number      is necessary for local operation).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large, making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.  IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number.\",\"I am very interested in investigations of starvation for improving health.

He viewed himself as a resourceful man, and (IMO) decided to check out gracefully if he couldn't support himself.

On the non-pacifist side:]  (1) Killing to defend the innocent may be, if anything, _more_ justifiable than killing in self-defense.  I can turn my _own_ other cheek, but I have no right to turn someone else's.  (2) It seems to me that if Jesus had meant to teach pacifism, He would have made His position more explicit.  He didn't tell the centurion to leave the army, for instance; and the NT is full of military metaphors.  [B. On the pacifist side:]  (1) Apparently many early Christians refused to fight in the Roman army, or stated that one should refuse if given a choice.  But it's not clear whether they were objecting to war _per se_, or objecting to Roman policies.  (2) In modern warfare, it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only at combatants.  Bombing, both conventional and nuclear, kills lots of civilians.  (3) It's hard to tell whether any _particular_ war is justified at the time.

There is no planet inside of the orbit of Mercury.  The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to Newtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations and calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system of equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was afoot with Mercury.  But alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915 and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian  geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of it's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession of Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb's numbers rather than Leverrier's.)  Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequent efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar have been fruitless.  -Bill Gawne   \\\"Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe   are the laws of the universe.\\\"                       - G.

The Roman Empire lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The main reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by the men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city of Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of Mazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter of time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto the rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle should be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of Constantinople only hastened the inevitable along.

Note the early use of PostScript technology, predating many of this year's papers listed in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.  -- Eric   Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),  by Dave Baraff, Tom Duff   From: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu  Newsgroups: comp.graphics  Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem  Organization: Program of Computer Graphics   I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.  First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.  Now, the phrasing of this question says \\\"if a line intersects a polygon\\\", so this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.  In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript.  (See \\\"PostScript Language\\\", by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).  So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P, and then \\\"outputs\\\" the answer.  By \\\"output\\\", we mean the program executes a command called \\\"showpage\\\", which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original problem.  There are two small problems with this approach.    (1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the  reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of  Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of  Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.   (2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the  PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in  other words, will it halt?   Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a  Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is  undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn  out to be undecidable.   I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite precision and running out of ink, paper or both.  A couple of references might be:  1. Principia Mathematica.  Newton, I.

Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill NJ  The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know better, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc. 37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)  --------  From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)  Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative.  (I think there's an '89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that deals with this).  --\",\"  Well, if you're going to get upset with this, you might as well direct some of this moral outrage towards Glavcosmos as well.  They pioneered this capitalist application of booster adverts long before NASA. (Sign of the times: a Sony logo on a Soyuz launcher...)   This sounds like something Lowell Wood would think of.  Does anyone know if he's involved?   This may be the purpose for the University of Colorado people.  My guess is that the purpose for the Livermore people is to learn how to build large, inflatable space structures.   If this is true, I think it's a great idea.  Learning how to build to build structures in space in an essential step towards space development, and given that Freedom appears to be shrinking towards the vanishing point, I question whether NASA's space station is going to provide much, if any, knowledge in this area. (Especially if a design such as Faget's wingless orbiter is chosen...) If such a project also monitors ozone depletion and demonstrates creative use of (partial) private sector funding in the process -- so much the better.   And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the \\\"wild idea\\\" stage or does it have real funding?   Not yet.

A technician examined it and  pronounced the disk drive unusable.  My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides). When CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.  I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.

Hamas figures significantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israel deported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to Hamas's kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer version appears in the May issue of Harper's Magazine, which obtained and translated the tape.)        My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished high school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work for Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I'm married and I have two daughters.      The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine explicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is Palestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli] Security Services.      Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation, cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose the methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into collaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally, we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.      We don't execute every collaborator. After all, about 70 percent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into their misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is based on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many collaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli Border Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once. He's as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an Israeli soldier.      There's another group of collaborators who perform an even more loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become collaborators. I regard the \\\"isqat\\\" [the process by which a Palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious duty to execute him.      A third group of collaborators is responsible for the distribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the Security Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the drugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.      In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of uncovering collaborators, We can't afford to abduct an innocent person, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished forever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any doubt, then he is executed.      In many cases, we don't have to make our evidence against collaborators public, because everyone knows that they're guilty. But when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is a collaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for evidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be irrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually obtained in the form of a confession.      At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell him that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the last moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the information we need.      We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has been a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them confess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply pressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts confess as well.      Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an interrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working for the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself confessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the information to us. In addition, three members of his network of collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this much evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are very careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our principal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he himself confesses his crimes.       A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be executed without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of names, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not mark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for execution.      When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can't shoot him -- to do so might give away our locations. That's why collaborators are strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, \\\"What do you think? How should we execute you?\\\" One collaborator told us, \\\"Strangle me.\\\" He hated the sight of blood. \",\"  I didn't mean to offend or anything, I'm just quoting Stanky himself on the subject.

To which Stanky replied, \\\"I'm Polish, not Jewish.\\\"  So maybe that wasn't the most PC thing for Stanky to say, and maybe I was a little naive when I posted it.

These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible    courses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary    styles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further    reading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT    introduction...  Two other Intros to consider:  The \\\"Introduction\\\" by Ku:mmel is a translation of a strandard NT text. The references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense, but the book contains a wealth of information.  Perrin and Duling's Intro is also very good.  It's somewhat more modern than Ku:mmel's but not quite so densely packed.  Also the authors tend to go through the books of the NT in the historical order of composition; this gives a very useful perspective on the development of the NT.     ... There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  ... Probably the    best recommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.  A slight dissent: I think the Harper's is \\\"OK\\\" but not great.  One particular problem I have is that it tends to be pretty skimpy on bibliographic material.  My feeling is that it is OK for quick look-ups, but not real useful for study in depth (e.g. I keep a copy in my office at work).     ... (I think there may be a couple of books with this title...

It does not go into great detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in general, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM. It is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It is posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining specifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.  CRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS ---------------------  - Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,   in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign   messages with your private key.    RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard   cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with   RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a   huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.  - Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,   since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow   an attacker to claim to be you.    DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be   compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies   have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each   message has a different DES key, the work for each message would   remain high.  KEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS ----------------------  - Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking   RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived   from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy   of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network   packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.    The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the   private key file across an untrusted link.  So don't do that.  Run    RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of   you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)   which nobody else has physical access to.  - Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could    allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him   rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your   intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with   the other bogus public key and pass them along.    It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.   The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent   has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be    given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key   authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is   not always practical.  Having other people \\\"vouch for you\\\" by   signing a statement containing your key is possible, although    RIPEM doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as   PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys   in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for   authentication.  PLAYBACK ATTACKS ----------------  - Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could   still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message   with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)   to Alice which says \\\"OK, let's do that.\\\" Your opponent intercepts   it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is   authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may   interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent   could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,   figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the   opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register    your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient   will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the   unknown message.    To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should    include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique   identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM   should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be   sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within   the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that   the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be   automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at   automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated   headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in   the utils directory.  LOCAL ATTACKS -------------  - Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of   the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under   UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,   although it would take some planning and effort to do something like   replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of   the plaintext, depending how it's stored.    In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is   an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine   which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an   eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your   passphrase.)    RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In   the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine,   which you have total control over and which nobody else has access   to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of   viruses, and so on.  However, there's a very real trade-off between   convenience and security here.    A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation   where other people have access (even root access), but increase   security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of   course) executable on a floppy disk.    Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing   in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their   own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the   security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since   you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you've just   given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and   install traps in your account to steal your private key next time   you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the   situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of   cleartext password authentication.    I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my   security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that   potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are   in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not   carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated   with greater care for critical correspondence.  UNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS -------------------------  - RIPEM's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key   corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the   traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she   may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There    exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an   ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by   you and readable by anyone, although RIPEM does not provide this   functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically   states that such transformations should be possible to allow   forwarding functions to work.\",\"Hi!  I think VGA-Copy can do what you need.

Everyone,  Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess my question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:  The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere.  This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used. The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold internationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!! How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?  I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear) is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not analytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things complicated. Please give me a hint.  I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not. However, so many people involved in the problem \\\"sphere from 4 poits\\\". Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?

What's entropy?   * In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?    A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a   decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of   functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of   ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the   decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that   D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption   of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key   (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext   into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to   encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.  * What is an attack?    In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method   of starting with some information about plaintexts and their   corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out   more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state   mathematically what this means. Here we go.    Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,   and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.    An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an   algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that   there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have   f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this   probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).    The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at   least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and   g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible   ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other   words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions   E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).    An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if   n = 2, and so on.  * What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?    In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.   Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this   property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem   is strong!''    In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely   formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is   strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against   all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as   defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this   statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist   any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement   to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that   the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.    Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical   definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions   we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can   figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used   properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.    The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst   can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to   construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,   and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.    * Why is the one-time pad secure?    By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the   plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)   of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive   or) of K and P.    It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial   single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform   distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform   distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,   i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,   with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and   g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of   K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also   be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is   uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p   that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus   a fortiori A is trivial.)    On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used   for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial   multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be   thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';   this explains the name ``one-time pad.''  * What's a ciphertext-only attack?    In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is   constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about   n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some   information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial   if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given   G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.    For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can   easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply   guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use   the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no   matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which   produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.   If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is   a nontrivial attack.  * What's a known-plaintext attack?    The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,   G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.   In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption   P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the   other decryption P_2.    Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature   as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the   cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him   decrypt further messages.  * What's a chosen-plaintext attack?    A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical   series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the   cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into   our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a   chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and   look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured   out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of   attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''    A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption   attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a   way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.    There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:   for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as   T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew   for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash   function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.  * In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?    Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some   plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're   also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find   K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).    If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed   on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results   only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial   attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many   possible keys.  * What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?    Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys   randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to   for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which   are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English   words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much   faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.\",\" So what's your point?  Mark's comment still is valid.  To suggest that AIDS is \\\"deserved\\\" IS ludicrous.  I sin.  I can resolve to abstain from  sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail. I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided  the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation. If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.  To willingly judge \\\"others\\\" as deserving punishment seems to me to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.      So what's the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in \\\"deviant\\\" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS of deviant sexual behavior with HIV+ people and never be infected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors, many of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors carry the risk of transmission.      The end of all things is to know, love and serve God, growing daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  Even so I could get AIDS.  Anyone could, unless they remain forever celibate, IV-drug-free, and transfusion free.  Larry Overacker (llo@shell.com) -- \",\"    Just a quick question. If Mary was Immaculately concieved, so she    could be a pure vessel, does this mean that she was without sin    and, therefore, the perfect (meaning sinless) female human being?    Is this why she is held so highly in the Catholic Church despite    it's basically patriarchical structure?  She was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to Original Sin, but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life.  This was possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God.  She is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to God, and everything that flows from that relationship.  The Catholic Church sees her as the new Eve.

I agree that we'll probably never agree, and I'm starting to feel  frustrated, and I'm tired of having my conversations with my husband  dominated by this topic (just kidding, :-)).  I do have to say, though, that participating in this discussion has been a good learning experience for me.  My views on this topic have evolved and clarified through this, and I suspect that we may not disagree as  much as we think.   I admit that I'm strongly prejudiced against evangelical Christianity, and I may not always be rational in my reactions to it.  I grew up in EC, and went to an EC college.  It was definitely the wrong place for me, and I react strongly to any implication that EC or conservative Christianity has any sort of stronghold on true Christianity.  I shudder  when I remember the condescending attitude I had about other Christians  who didn't adhere to the EC model.  I have come to see that my real objection to this whole notion of  absolute truth is the actions I have seen it lead to.  I have had some  very bad experiences with evangelical Christians claiming to know the  truth, and judging me or others based on their belief that they have  the answers.  Knowing the truth doesn't seem to leave a whole lot of  room for others' opinions.  I can accept your belief in absolute truth as long as you* don't try to  use that belief to try to force others to comply with it, and you are  very careful that you don't hurt others with it.  Love your neighbor  seems to go totally out the window when one knows the truth and believes  that everyone should be living by that truth.  Other people have  convictions about the truth every bit as strong and sincere as yours,  based on careful searching, prayer, and their relationship with God.   Don't dismiss them because God didn't lead them to the same conclusions  as yours.  *This is not directed personally at you, Dean.\",\"In revision of history <9304131827@zuma.UUCP> as posted by Turkish Government Agents under the guise of sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic) LIE in response to article <1993Apr13.033213.4148@urartu.sdpa.org> hla@urartu.sdpa.org and scribed:   [(*]    Orhan Gunduz is blown up.

Side question:  how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with a replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles, after say 100/200/300K actual miles.

Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.  Right now, there are mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources (for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before uranium reached $200/lb.  \\\"Demand and supply balance will collapse\\\" is nonsense.  Supply and demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century? Not bloody likely.  New nuclear reactors are not being built at a sufficient rate.  Uranium from seawater is interesting, but it's a long term project, or a project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of self-sufficiency.\",\" I don't think they're paying for it.   Useful?

According to Demirok, Greek Cypriot administration not only  gives shelter to PKK guerillas but also supplies them with  food and weapons at the temporary camps set up in its territory.  Demirok disclosed that PKK has three safe houses in South Cyprus,  used by terrorists such as Ferhat. In the camps, he added,  terrorists were trained to use various weapons including RPG's  and anti-aircraft guns which had been purchased directly from  the Greek government. Greek Cypriot government has gone to the  extent of issuing special identification cards to PKK members so  that they can travel from one region to another without being  confronted by legal obstacles. Demirok's account was confirmed  by another PKK defector, Fatih Tan, who gave himself over to  police in Hakkari after spending four years with PKK. Tan explained that the terrorists went through a training in camps in South Cyprus,  sometimes for a period of 12 weeks or more.           \\\"Torture in Greece: Hidden Reality\\\"  Case 1: Kostas Andreadis and Dimitris Voglis.  ...Andreadis' head was covered with a hood and he was tortured by falanga (beating on the soles of the feet), electric shocks, and was threatened with being thrown out of the window.

The Israeli  secret service,        Mossad,  is   reported  to  have   acquired  significant        information in connection  with the camps set  up in the        Troodos  mountains   in  Cyprus  for  the   training  of        militants of the PKK and ASALA {Armenian Secret Army for        the Liberation  of Armenia}. According to  sources close        to Mossad, about 700 Kurdish, Greek Cypriot and Armenian        militants  are   undergoing  training  in   the  Troodos        mountains in  southern Cyprus.  The same  sources stated        that Abu  Nidal's special  advisers are  giving military        training to  the PKK and  ASALA militants in  the camps.        They added that the  militants leave southern Cyprus for        Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Greece  and Iran after completing        their training.  Mossad has established that  due to the        clashes  which were  taking  place  among the  terrorist        groups based  in Syria, the PKK  and ASALA organisations        moved to  the Greek Cypriot  part of Cyprus,  where they        would  be  more  comfortable. They  also  transferred  a        number of  their camps in  northern Syria to the Troodos        mountains.         Mossad  revealed that  the  Armenian National  Movement,        which is known as the MNA, has opened liaison offices in        Nicosia, Athens and  Tripoli in order to  meet the needs        of the  camps. The offices are used to provide  material        support for the  Armenian  camps. Meanwhile, the  leader        of the  Popular Front for  the Liberation of  Palestine,        George  Habash, is  reported  to  have ordered  his  men        not  to   participate  in  the  operations  carried  out        by  the  PKK &  ASALA, which  he  described  as \\\"extreme        racist,  extreme  nationalist  and   fascist.\\\"  Reliable        sources have said that  Habash believed that  the recent        operations carried  out by the PKK  militants  show that        organisation  to  be a  band  of  irregulars  engaged in        extreme  nationalist  operations.  They  added  that  he        instructed  his militants  to sever their links with the        PKK  and avoid clashing with it. It has been established        that George Habash  expelled ASALA  militants  from  his        camp  after ASALA's  connections  with  drug trafficking        were exposed.

It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal civlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967 without civil and political rights.

All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians are concerned and as far as common sense has it.   It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens and the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.  Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel is entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be entitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel to enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.  To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a crime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss  to which Israeli society has degraded.   I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return and live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ? Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their religion or ethnic origin ?

If you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent.  However, if a professional thief wants your vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:  1) ignition kill or fuel cut-off 2) a flashing red LED  These two are basic to a decent alarm system.   To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock. That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target. But, then there's always car-jacking.   Why is life so confusing?

Note that the film industry in California traded their political support for an \\\"assault weapon\\\" ban in the state for an amendment to the bill exempting the entertainment industry from that very ban.  Note that the very issue of the Batman comic book (\\\"Seduction of the Gun\\\") that was produced as a tool for gun-control organizations carries a back- page ad for a \\\"Terminator II\\\" video game extolling the numerous and varied sophisticated weapons available to the player.  Note that Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of the NY Times -- one of the oldest and most incessant gun-control grinders -- himself carries a concealed handgun.

Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That means third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consulting a 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at  21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks. Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are wrong.  By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as California, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally  stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law,  but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors, willing to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was terribly upset about this.  I remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a clinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wondering a bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice doesn't have a grain of truth to it.\",\"From another space forum     When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56  solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers  lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB.  The tool survived  the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot  altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.      NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,      \\\"It's been a long time since something like this happened.  We've  lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this.\\\"      The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a  Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on  April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the  report and Discovery was launched with its \\\"extra payload\\\".  NASA  officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th  launch date.      The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB  technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster,  its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a  part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.      A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that  the Shuttle processor will take \\\"appropriate action\\\".  Thiokol is a  subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch.  _________________________________________________________  Karl Anderson  DEV/2000: Configuration Management/Version Control  Dept 53K/006-2  Rochester, Minnesota 55901 253-8044  Tie 8-453-8044 INTERNET: karl@vnet.ibm.com PRODIGY: CMMG96A\",\" Hi...

H. Welbon)]         For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?   There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses word \\\"on faith\\\", we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now. If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods?   The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing, rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?   I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found.\",\"    Just curious, Roger, but since you have such a vast knowledge of the game and the league, how come you haven't made a living out of it?

I will for the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes that the bible is God's word to mankind?  I suspect that what happened to him is what he'll call being \\\"born again\\\"?  Anyway, was that recent? If the answer is \\\"yes\\\" to all the questions above, it is quite understandable.  However, IMO, I'ld rather give advice to your friend! I think I've been through something similar to him, and one thing I can say is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to communicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things is because they are now \\\"obvious\\\" to him.  What is \\\"obvious\\\" to him is not obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because from his point of view, he has been on \\\"both sides of the fence\\\".  This I mean that before he turned \\\"fundamentalist\\\", you two are agreeable because both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if a new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the discovery of let's say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, he's got to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than where he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now. You have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to you, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that risk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand and listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because he is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about, however, he may not realise that he's really putting you off.  [...]   So far, I've only been trying to explain things from his side.  However, I do understand how you feel too, because I wasn't a Christian for a good part of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or \\\"fundamentalists\\\" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their faith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately, \\\"religious belief\\\" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism is also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is inevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise), it will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both sides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can do your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he's trying to convince you about, that it's beyond you or not your concern \\\"for now\\\".  Don't tell him it's nonsense, because to him it is reality - and that would be a real insult.  He'll also have to be careful not to insult where you stand too.  Like I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too. I'll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a Christian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little differently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited and just blabbered away about what I've found!  To me, it was too good not to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn't really care most of the time what they thought.  You will probably think he's crazy too - but God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in mind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real to him, he doesn't see why God can't be real to you too.  I don't know how helpful this is to you.  But all the best anyhow - this is quite a challenge for you to face.  By the way, personal conviction: nobody is \\\"beyond saving\\\" except the one we call the  devil and his hosts.\",\"We are getting a memory fault and a core dump whenever we end a Motif session under Ultrix 4.3, running on a DEC 5000/240.

It is not necessary to celebrate a pagan goddess in the process.  Paul answered your question in Romans 9.  In v. 4 he stated that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the promises were given to the Israelites.  It is a package deal.  He goes on to identify those who are true Israelites.  Vs 6-8 makes it plain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way but those who accept the promise of God.  Paul continued to emphasize that he was an Israelite in 2 Cor. 11:22, then in Gal 3:29 he says that all those who belong to Christ are Abraham's seed, and heirs to all the promises given to the Israelites.  The promises come with the law.  It is all or nothing.  Why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law?  Certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you.

In fact they despised Christianity as a weak pacifist religion, and were much more keen on pagan glorification of strength and warfare.

Unless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys from men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex (due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the children from abuse by members of the *same* sex.  If we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest that if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a practical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations in which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse them. By working together \\\"with good will on both sides\\\", we may be able to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.  Mr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for personal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long* stretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish and it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the future. \",\"     One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was the Mitsubishi.  I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just been released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed several monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the Nanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last year.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing criteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I scored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it scored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.  Incidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading reviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the criteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product testing was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly know what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the ranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet your needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of what we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply more closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you don't also understand the scoring.\",\"I live at sea-level, and am called-upon to travel to high-altitude cities quite frequently, on business.  The cities in question are at 7000 to 9000 feet of altitude.  One of them especially is very polluted...  Often I feel faint the first two or three days.  I feel lightheaded, and my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sea-level.

Many thanks,\",\"Your \\\"lite\\\" posting for the day, from rec.humor.funny:  -- \",\" What about the common joystick found in all computer shops?\",\"One not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guys...  For our class project, we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs:  Voltatge:  adjustable from 1-12V Current:   *limited* at 1A  Voltage must stay within 2% of designated value for I from 0-1A AC ripple less than 5 mV (rms)  Of course, we can't just use an adjustable voltage, current-limiting regulator chip ;^)  Our problem is with the current limiting (i.e. we've found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit).  What the supply must do, if presented with a load which would draw more than 1A, given the supply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp.  Thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we should read one amp.  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm  resistor at 12V, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by necessity, must be 1V.  The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output  power transistor, and therefore reduce the output.  So, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?  Thanks in advance.

Further, the early church bears testimony to the impact.   Of course they knew where it was. Don't forget that Jesus was seen by both the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker. Pilate was no fool and didn't  need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus' body to  make it appear He had arisen. Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a  man well know to the Sanhedrin, to say that they didn't know where He was buried begs the question.  Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think on this a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a  deliberate lie!? If not, then why do you think the disciples would!? Now, I'm not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth,  but unbeknown to you, it is a lie. Many have done this. No, I'm talking about dying, by beheading, stoning, crucifixion, etc., for something you know to be a lie! Thus, you position with regards to the disciples stealing the  body seems rather lightweight to me.  As for graverobbers, why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over  the body of Jesus? He wasn't buried with great riches. So, again, this is an argument that can be discounted.  That leaves you back on square one. What happened to the body!?

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?\",\"                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Wow!

It can convert bitmaps to Corel art format.  These can then be imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap. Result - the file is completely in Corel format and can be SCODAL'ed no problem!  BUT the slight problem with this, which makes the solution less than idea, is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments.  So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to image.  The obvious solution is time-consuming - stripping out the extra points by hand using Corel.  OUCH! I've done it a few times :-]                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  As I say, if you don't mind the problems, go via the route...

A similar law in the US allows chiropractors to practice in VA hospitals but I've never seen one there and I don't know of a single VA that has hired a chiropractor. There are a lot of Britons on the net, so someone should be able to tell us if the NHS provides homeopaths for you.   --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\": >: English cars:- : > : >: Rover, Reliant, Morgan, Bristol, Rolls Royce, etc. : >                  ^^^^^^ : >   Talk about Harleys using old technology, these : >Morgan people *really* like to use old technology.  : Well, if you want to pick on Morgan, why not attack its ash (wood) : frame or its hand-bent metal skin (just try and get a replacement :-)).   : I thought the kingpost suspension was one of the Mog's better features.

How about *this* question instead?  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a political opponent of a senior administration official and      intercepts a conversation...  Kinda changes your interpretation of the event, doesn't it?  And yes, the presence of the Clipper Chip DOES change things, because it will not only give the people talking on the phone a false sense of security, it will also give federal law enforcement agencies the justification to deny use of strong encryption methods that are inconvenient to them. Dang it all, it's SUPPOSED to be inconvenient (but not impossible). That's the ONLY sure way to make sure that abuses are minimized while still allowing legitimate law enforcement access.    Uh huh... sure.  I predict that within two months (weeks?) of the chip's debut, the full technical details will be posted to sci.crypt.  And if this has ANY impact on the security of the key escrow system, then we've been lied to.  Any cryptosystem worth its salt can withstand the light of public scrutiny, and there is NO WAY you can be sure that an algorithm has no \\\"unrecognized vulnerabilities\\\" unless you have half the world trying to break it for a decade or so.  Even then, you gotta be careful. \",\"     There's been extensive discussion on the CompuServe Cancer Forum about Dr.  Burzynski's treatment as a result of the decision of a forum member's father  to undertake his treatment for brain glioblastoma.  This disease is  universally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992, the  tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forum  member checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki's track record for this disease.   He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from  glioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had  audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive.   After the forum member's father began Dr. Burzynski's treatment in  September, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his  oncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of  shrinkage or necrosis.  The patient's oncologist, although telling him he would probably not live  past December 1992, was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynski's  treatment.  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynski's  treatment, she's since changed her attitude toward continuing these  treatments, saying \\\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\\"  Dr. Burzynski is an M.D., Ph.D. with a research background who found a  protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized it,  and administers it to patients with certain cancer types.

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin   e. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.  Your perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.  Similarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.\",\"I  have one of the original Powerbook 170's (with 4Mb of Ram) and find that 4Mb is a drag when trying to do my work.

Low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz (and THESE have significant temperature drifts, which one doesn't often notice while wearing the watch on one's wrist).  Low temperature sensitivity is available in other crystal types, which unfortunately are larger and higher frequency (1 MHz or so) and take more battery power.     Programmable timers might be less accurate, but they are more power-stingy than suitable crystal oscillators.\",\"Many of you at this point have seen a copy of the  Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act by now.

Several sets I've looked at use a 135 volt regulator.  The regulators have a tendency to short out, making the safety circuits shut down the EHT supply section.  Try putting the set on a Variac or adjustable transformer and lower the AC input voltage to the set to about 90 volts.  If the set operates nromally, then you know you've got a shorted regulator.

Leading the first Armenian units who crossed the Ottoman  border in the company of the Russian invaders was the former Ottoman  Parliamentary representative for Erzurum, Karekin Pastirmaciyan, who  assumed the revolutionary name Armen Garo. Another former Ottoman  parliamentarian, Hamparsum Boyaciyan, led the Armenian guerrilla forces  who ravaged Turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname \\\"Murad\\\",  especially ordering that            'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in            whatever circumstances you find them.

In March 1915, the Russian forces began to move toward Van. Immediately, in April 11, 1915 the Armenians of Van began a revolt, massacring all  the Turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy  conquest by Russians. Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a  telegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in  April 21, 1915, \\\"thanking it for its services to Russia.\\\" The Armenian  newspaper Gochnak, published in the United States, also proudly  reported in May 24, 1915 that   \\\"only 1,500 Turks remained in Van the rest having been slaughtered.\\\"  Source: Hovannisian, Richard G.: Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

Our artillery knocked the huts   into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable   and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets   completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for   howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the   scattered bones of the dead.\\\"                                Ohanus Appressian                             \\\"Men Are Like That\\\"                                    p. 202.

The main legal principles of the Turkish State  are summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:   \\\"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State  governed by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public  peace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;  loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental  tenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.\\\"  Freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The fact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be attributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution. The first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856. Although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force only temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.  The 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and the right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution of 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing the power of the Parliament and the government.  The First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the occupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was abolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the occupying forces.  During the Independence War, the \\\"Turkish Grand National Assembly\\\" held their first meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new Turkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish Republic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new Constitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal  backbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a  multi-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by others in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been based on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national sovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.  \\\"Major Principles of the Constitution\\\"  The constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic within the following principles:  - The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by    law; - It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,   human rights and the objectives of Ataturk; - The language of the State is Turkish; - Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.   Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation; - Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This   power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else; - Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers; - Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the   Turkish nation; - All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,   sex, or political beliefs; - Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.  \\\"Structure of the State\\\"  In accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the principle of \\\"division of power\\\" to create a balanced and self-controlled system. The power is divided into \\\"legislative power,\\\" \\\"executive power,\\\" and \\\"judicial power,\\\" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each other (self-control).   A. Legislative Power:   The \\\"Turkish Grand National Assembly\\\" is a parliament with one House, elected  by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on  behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:   - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;  - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;  - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;  - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;  - to ratify international agreements;  - to grant amnesty or pardons.   Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral  or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is  divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is  calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age  of twenty-one can vote.   Elections are supervised by the \\\"Supreme Council of Elections,\\\" which solves  all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local \\\"Board of Election\\\"  runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the  Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among   independent judges.   B. Executive Power:   The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government  as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:   - to represent the State and the Country;  - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;  - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;  - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;  - to ratify laws and government decrees.    The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven  years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may   call for a referendum.   Executive power is exercised by the \\\"Council of Ministers,\\\" headed by the  Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the  members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval  by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their  program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)  Ministers in the Council.   Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent  \\\"administrative\\\" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or  functions against any law.   C. Judicial Power:   Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can  instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be   discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the  reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories  of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:   - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The     decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice    upon the appeal of the parties involved.  - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime    Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in    administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.    The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the    high administrative court.   The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the  \\\"Constitutional Court\\\" if they contradict the Constitution. If found  contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.   Serdar Argic\",\"Well I am using The Home Office. I bought it for arounde $350. It does 14.4.

I imagine it has something to do with a missing screen driver, or something along those lines, but figured someone out there in Internet land might be able to help.  I am installing it on a machine that already has OpenLook installed, and would like to have both installed concurrently.  Thus, I set it up to compile to my /usr/X11R5 directory.  I worked out all the kinks in getting it compiled (with gcc), so that it compiles without any warnings.  I need it installed for PEX-SI, so I set all those appropriate flags.  When I run it, however, I get a message along the lines of:  Getting interface configuration : Operation not supported on socket  sunOpenFrameBuffer : Inappropriate ioctl for device  Fatal server error : no screens found    Any ideas on how I can fix it?

That statement must therefore say that any argument in favor of seatbelts or airbags is an argument against automobiles.  Any argument for lifeguards is an argument against swimming.  It says that any agrgument in favor of safety precautions is an argument for banning the activity to  which the precautions apply.  Extrapolating to that degree is ridiculous, there wouldn't be any normal human activity left to do; therefore it is a non-seqitur.  Also, even though most people do not ride motorcycles, they do boat, sail, jetski, climb, ski, fly parachute, hang-glide, glide, bungee-jump, bike, skate, rollerblade, skateboard, play rugby (ouch), mow the lawn, rewire the basement, operate heavy machinery,  and do a host of other 'dangerous' things that would all be as valid as motorcycling as activities to ban.

Whether this is your problem or not I don't know. I have had sporadic SCSI problems with my IIfx since I bought it. (I cannot connect more than three devices, fourth one causes major problems).  First thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system. If you continue to get errors it is probably the drive. If it formats fine then I would try to format it on your system with no externals. If this  fails then the SCSI controller on your IIfx needs repair/replacement.  Hope this helps.  \",\"        Well, lets see....I took a class on this last fall, and I have no notes so I'll try to wing it...           Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that  black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars, M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking appoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time, they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any of these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of the galaxy.           Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the various satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either Pion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our catalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic distribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of homogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE. Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I suppose you are saying, \\\"Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the disk.\\\"  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an  analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile away sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different, and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe find a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.           I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As I said before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short timescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of behavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources. When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk, but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources  in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of these characteristics.  \",\" I did say *any* invader, didn't I?

Assuming that they are using civilians for cover, are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country? If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working? Why is it  further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages? Why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone? You see, there is more to the shelling of the villages.... it is called RETALIATION... \\\"GETTING BACK\\\" ...\\\"GETTING EVEN\\\". It doesn't make sense to shell the villages. The least it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of civilians.     If Israel is not willing to accept the \\\"word\\\" of others then, IMHO, it has no business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks.    No, I am not Basil. I think Basil is a very intelligent person and I respect what he writes. Basil is a person that I would gladly call a friend. He is, however, not me. Nor am I Lebanese, as some seem to suspect.    Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. Of course, if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't make the Lebanese so mad as to do that. Furthermore, with Hezbollah  subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.   Tim, when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border? Not lately, eh?  Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use territory under their control to attack Israel. While Lebanon would be better off with Syria and Israel out of its borders, the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory (not on Israeli troops in Lebanon, however. Please note the distinction) in the past two years.   I disagree, Basil has always seemed to me to be a cool-headed person, slow to anger (certainly more so than I). What is most important is that he is an  actual witness to things from the other end of the Israeli guns. If only the  Israeli government would remember what it was like when the roles were  reversed perhaps they would moderate their \\\"retaliation\\\".\",\"Coming from a long line of \\\"hot tempered\\\" people, I know temper when I see it.

Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I'll give  your question a shot.   The key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really  have to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need  10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your  pages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not  toner.  But that should go without saying.  My PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little  while to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once  the computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out  every 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.    The BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I'm assuming that the DeskJet can, or  HP wouldn't sell many......  Size is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built  like a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.  Finally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200's resolution.  It looks like  a good laser quality print.  The HP's I've used.....they look like ink.

McConkie's views have been controversial (e.g. \\\"The Seven Deadly Heresies\\\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best, or erroneous at worst (\\\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation\\\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations (his book \\\"Mormon Doctrine\\\" is oftentimes referred to as \\\"McConkie's Bible\\\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.

I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email, followup to t.p.g.  1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get    a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I    was told by a police officer. 2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to    protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns    must be stored locked up and unloaded, however. 3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will    be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.    The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form    authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.      Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these    'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will    be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess    them, but will not be allowed to stock them. 4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will    not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations    specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some     manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.    (God knows how much they'll charge for these)  This covers most of what we discussed.

We know that early Christians suffered totures because of their witness to Christ.  For example:  ACT 5:40    His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had             them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of             Jesus, and let them go.  ACT 5:41    The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been             counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.  It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion to even hearing Jesus's name. ACT 5:28    \\\"We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,\\\" he said.             \\\"Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are             determined to make us guilty of this man's blood.\\\"  Finally, the first apostle's death, James of Zebedee was certainly not by Rome's hand any more than the first martyr Stephen.     The problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection, then one must believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what He stood for and preached during His ministry on Earth.  That would have been extremely difficult for some people, especially those that had plotted to kill Him.   \",\"Was going over some videos last night.....  Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very interesting.  And enlightening.  Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco, circa June 1986.  1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,     not gain more bulk.  2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's     lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.  3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like     Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is     released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -     Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his     stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,     they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard     to make adjustments in your swing.  What would I do, if I were Jose?  Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch, so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.  First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance, and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move the bathead more freely.  Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.  Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength  is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park.  If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could still hit 600+ HR.  \",\"In <sfnNTrC00WBO43LRUK@andrew.cmu.edu> \\\"David R. Sacco\\\" <dsav+@andrew.cmu.edu>    Yes.

I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a \\\"fake\\\" Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data.  Quest 1. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.) I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?  Quest 2. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

According -> > to the Federalist Paper's, a well regulated militia has a well defined  -> > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations. ->  -> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!  Perhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the \\\"well regulated malitia.\\\"  Here is what is says about its character:    To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes   of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through   military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to   acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the   character of a well-regulated militia,   It also talks about the \\\"well regulated militia\\\" having a nationally uniform in structure and disipline.    I will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:       Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with  respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed  and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it  will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of  a year.  But, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large group of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people every year, provide a basic training to new people so they can be integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it  requires a continually standing committee of organizers.    Since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and disipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim a \\\"well regulated militia\\\" is not well organized.  But I will concide  a \\\"well organized militia\\\" is not necessarily a \\\"well regulated militia.\\\"   Several people have stated that the \\\"well organized militia\\\" is what is defined under 10 USC 311, which states   The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied   males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in   section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are,   or who have made a declaration of intention to become,   citizens of the United States and of female citizents of   the United States who are commissioned officers of the   National Guard.  This deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \\\"well regulated.\\\" 10 USC 311 does not define a \\\"well regualed militia\\\" in any way, shape,  or form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia The Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \\\"well regualed militia\\\" as a proper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it talk above \\\"disciplining all the militia of the United States\\\" so they fit the \\\"character of a well-regulated militia.\\\"  This is what the paragraph states about the associated costs:   It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor   of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the   present numbers of the people, would not fall far short   of the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all   the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the   mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,  would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not   succeed, because it would not long be endured.   Another quote provide by Charles Scripter is: James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \\\"General Welfare\\\" clause):   \\\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first  to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a  recital of particulars.\\\"  So the phrase \\\"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall  not be infringed\\\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \\\"a well  regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\\\"   The definition of \\\"explain\\\" as stated in \\\"The American Hertitage Dictionary of the Enlish Language\\\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:  1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;     elucidate: \\\"It was the economists who undertook to explain      this puzzle\\\"  2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.  3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:     explain an error The second phrase clearly does not \\\"explain\\\" the first, therefore the second phrase must \\\"qualify\\\" the first.  The definition given for \\\"qualify\\\" is:  1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities     of; characterize.  2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or      task.  3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.  4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.  5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate  6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase) Since \\\"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed\\\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and it has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task. By process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since #3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it must be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \\\"the right  of the people to keep and bear Arms\\\" gives legal power to the \\\"well  regualated militia\\\" and this legal power \\\"shall not be infringed\\\".    I thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more  evidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the  people's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little  about the right of an untrained person to \\\"keep and bear\\\" a .50 caliber machine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm (something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun safety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine gun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with me.  -> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy -> our Liberties and Rights.

In the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized emphasis mine):  \\\"The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed to be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in this specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB), and that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be able to import any TIFF image, since there are so many image-generating applications out there now.\\\"   If a program (or worse all applications) can't read >every< TIFF image, that means there are some it won't- some that I might have to deal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?  I don't and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not that anyone does, of course! :-)\",\"I think you are too optimistic!

(if you are familiar with Insight, you know the kit I mean).  I believe the drive is either a Texel (265ms) or an NEC (280ms), but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the bundle (at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight answer as to which one; ah, yes, one of the drawbacks of OEM!).  Other questions:  - Excuse my ignorance, but is \\\"Texel\\\" a reputable maker in the CD-ROM   market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive?  - Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?  (Currently, $449 for the   TA-1000, and $699 for the TA-2000)  Alternatively, I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my uses (however, I *do* want full multimedia capabilities, Photo CD stuff, educational programs for my kids, etc.), and considered the lower-end TA-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something else useful, like a tape back-up drive unit.

I wrote that human brains \\\"are infested with sin\\\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.    Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your conscience is properly formed?  The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the formed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure that your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation can be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll grant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.  Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be certain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is `properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)   Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:   The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation? How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or another -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?  You write:   But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I am confident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way from `confident'.  This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain (really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is significantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that you are confident, that invites people to ask why.  Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely certain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any idea of his own fallibility.   I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of them -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible. The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.   Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu  [This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the original criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong answers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal consequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is at least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that -- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are fallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these basic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's unlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of confidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for example said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell, and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and intolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's some chance I'm wrong.  Don't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant Christians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least some cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger. If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for certain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I think it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that way.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most difficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell what I think is the truth.\",\" It would seem logical that the mask is Potvins.

Thanks, \",\"  : I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of : the world  if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group : of the population.   I've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties with Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority of people, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though 90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland, religious people are actually a minority.   Could it be possible that many people believe in god \\\"just in case\\\"? It seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal's Wager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn't care - it believes, but doesn't know what or how.   People don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle, they only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say that they are not \\\"born in the Spirit\\\", but this does not disturb them. Religion is not something to think about.   I'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless -  a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to. Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many people take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow (and unconsciously hope god wouldn't notice ;-) )  : Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a : higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The : typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the : same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the : other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn : somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core, : than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it : expresses its own selfishness.  If logic and reason are valued, then I would claim that atheistic thinking is of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessary assumptions they believe in - I've yet to see good reasons to believe in gods, or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do.  However, why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bears some resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematics works?

Gregg is not, as I understand his posts, giving any support to the bounty on Rushdie's life.  If that's correct, end of one point...  Gregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners don't accept. His comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him, and are even making a _little_ sense to me now - if a person is a member of a group (religion or whatever) they bind themselves to follow the ways of the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum. The big bone of contention here that I'm picking up is that in the West we have secular governments that maintain, more or less, a level of control and of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups.  I think the majority of us reading this thread are in tune (note - I didn't say \\\"in agreement\\\") with the idea that you are finally responsible to the secular government,  and within that to the group or groups a person may have chosen.  With that in mind, it not possible under secular law (\\\"legally\\\" as most people would define the term) to hold a person to a particular group once they decide to separate from it.  Only if the secular authorities agree that there is a requirement of some sort (contractual, etc) is there any secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or past group member.  A religion can, and often does, believe in and require additional duties of a group member.  And it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties in many ways - ostracism is common for example.  But the limit comes when the enforcement would impose unwanted and/or unaccepted onus on a person _in conflict with secular law_.  This is the difference.  In a theocracy, the requirements of the secular authorities are, by definition, congruent with the religious authorities. Outside a theocracy, this is not _necessarily_ true.  Religious requirements _may_ coincide or may not.  Similiarly, religious consequences _may_ or may not coincide with secular consequences (if any).

As published in \\\"US Industrial Outlook 1993\\\"  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be \\\"adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.\\\"                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  \\\"Space Business Indicators\\\" in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year  through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request \\\"launch on demand\\\"  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/\\\"Spacelifter\\\" program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all \\\"ELV upgrade\\\" programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \\\"Spacelifter\\\"  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \\\"GO-AHEAD\\\"    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a \\\"Star Wars\\\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \\\"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\\\"     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst's report Morgan Stanley said \\\"We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.\\\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \\\"Aerokosmos\\\"  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \\\"Severkosmos\\\",  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one's a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \\\"the main  alternative rocket supplier\\\" for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of \\\"off the shelf\\\" components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the  satellite's communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \\\"Asiasat- 2\\\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based \\\"Asiasat\\\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's  aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \\\"made in Korea.\\\"   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xt happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered,  the specification does not guarantee such a sequence, and supplemental  authoritative documents (i.e. the Asente/Swick volume) do say that the order is undefined.  Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.  In general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating  independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other callbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be  registered can explicitly call other functions necessary.  [4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?   XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not  actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?    It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback, which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer is set to one of the valid values. If it is not a \\\"yes\\\" answer, the code drops out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop:    void quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)  {   int             answer;   answer = AskUser(w, \\\"Really Quit?\\\");   if (RET_YES == answer)    {    answer = AskUser(w, \\\"Are You Really Positive?\\\");    if (RET_YES == answer)     exit(0);                 }  }   A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether  to overwrite it.  This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the calling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the  Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of  dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for \\\"OK\\\", \\\"Cancel\\\" and  \\\"Help\\\" or equivalents:    int AskUser(w, string)         Widget          w;         char           *string;   {         int             answer=RET_NONE; /* some not-used marker */         Widget          dialog;   /* could cache&carry, but ...*/         Arg             args[3];         int             n = 0;         XtAppContext    context;          n=0;         XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,                 XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;         XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;         dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);         XtManageChild(dialog);          context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);         while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {                 XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);         }         XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */         return answer;   }   The dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same  function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user  finally selects one of those choices:    void response(w, client, call)         Widget          w;         XtPointer client;         XtPointer call;   {   int *answer = (int *) client;   XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;         switch (reason->reason) {         case XmCR_OK:                 *answer = RET_YES; /* some #define value */                 break;         case XmCR_CANCEL:                 *answer = RET_NO;    break;         case XmCR_HELP:                 *answer = RET_HELP;                 break;         default:                 return;         } }  and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and continues from there.

I have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is.   Users of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function, which  will work on both widgets and non-widget objects.   If you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do  what you want. Note that it depends on the widget's internal data structures  and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt, including R4.   #include <X11/CoreP.h>  #include <X11/Xresource.h>  String XtName (widget)  Widget widget; /* WILL work with non-widget objects */  {  return XrmNameToString(widget->core.xrm_name);  }  [7/90; modified with suggestion by Larry Rogers (larry@boris.webo.dg.com) 9/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 125)  Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindow(widget)? I'm doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics within my Xt-based program:    The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the  realization of the widget.  Using a window id of NULL (\\\"no window\\\") could  create the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget()  before attempting to use the window associated with a widget.   Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call,  but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also  wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?  The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of  the screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can take the following steps to avoid the error:  1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture. 2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle. 3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap. 4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the image from the pixmap. 5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and  the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you  the parts of the pixmap which aren't good. 6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.  [10/92; thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com)]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 127)  How can my application tell if it is being run under X?   A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight character-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:    display = XOpenDisplay(display_name);  if (display)   { do X stuff }  else   { do curses or something else } where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following -display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case  XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].  This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line  argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is  adequate. [5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 128)  How do I make a \\\"busy cursor\\\" while my application is computing? Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?   The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is  as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel  window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other  application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the  user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual  desktop.) Substitute \\\"toplevel\\\" with your top-most widget here (similar code  should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):       unsigned long valuemask;      XSetWindowAttributes attributes;       /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */      valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;      attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |          ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);      attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);       /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by         its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */      XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,          65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,          CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);  where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen, particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767.  When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to normal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well.  In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor  resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events.

An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which  continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its  children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X  connection to the display.   What you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process,    close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget))); to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your  exec. You will then be able to exit the parent.  Alternatively, before exec'ing make this call, which causes the file  descriptor to be closed on exec.

Greg Holmberg (holmberg@frame.com), 3/93.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 130)  Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler?   No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical  sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which  might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave the library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by  Xlib or Xt functions.  You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added.   Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly  Volume 6 are in error.  [Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse  (converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 131)  What are these \\\"Xlib sequence lost\\\" errors?   You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error  handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or  Xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?   It's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input  both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but  which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or  the other file descriptor.  A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor, use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be  called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your  program's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt  callback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only non-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.  Most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an  input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.  Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file. You will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending. XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is  called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is new data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always  ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almost always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the  type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your  function to test whether there is new data:       if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return; But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a  busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting  a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.

You can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting the window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget which should receive the event.   If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use  XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you avoid a round-trip to the server.  Depending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call its action procedures in order to get the effects you want.  [courtesy Mark A. Horstman (mh2620@sarek.sbc.com), 11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 134)  Why doesn't anything appear when I run this simple program?    You are right to map the window before drawing into it. However, the  window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen -- until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will  generally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code  would appear after window was created and mapped:   while (!done)     {       XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);       switch (the_event.type) {  case Expose:  /* On expose events, redraw */   XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);   break;  ...  }     }   Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't  set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background  colors, so this program could previously include this code:   ...   the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */   the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */   the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,                 GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);   ...   Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is  black and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1  and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be  reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.  Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong  thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for  foreground and background.  And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program if you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may not yet have appeared.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?   The 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A  server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0, unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit -- the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available  Screens on this particular Display connection.  The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.  In Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine  the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.  (Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the Screen have \\\"Display\\\" in the names --  XDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11? Motif? XView?    The X11R4/5 header files are compatible with C++. The Motif 1.1 header  files are usable as is inside extern \\\"C\\\" {...}. However, the definition of String in Intrinsic.h can conflict with the libg++ or other String class and needs to be worked around.

It works by building a set of C++ classes in parallel to the class tree of the  widgets.  The C++ InterViews toolkit is obtainable via anonymous FTP from  interviews.stanford.edu. InterViews uses a box/glue model similar to that of  TeX for constructing user interfaces and supports multiple looks on the user  interfaces. Some of its sample applications include a WYSIWIG document editor  (doc), a MacDraw-like drawing program (idraw) and an interface builder  (ibuild).  THINGS,  a class library written at the Rome Air Force Base by the  Strategic Air Command, available as freeware on archive sites.   Motif++ is a public-domain library that defines C++ class wrappers for Motif 1.1; it adds an \\\"application\\\" class for, e.g., initializing X, and also integrates WCL and the Xbae widget set. This work was developed by Ronald van  Loon <rvloon@cv.ruu.nl> based on X++, a set of bindings done by the University  of Lowell Graphics Research Laboratory.

Versions of the CLX Lisp bindings are part of the X11 core source  distributions. A version of CLX is on the R5 tape [10/91]; version 5.0.2 [9/92] is on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/CLX.R5.02.tar.Z.   The SAIC Ada-X11 bindings are through anonymous ftp in /pub from stars.rosslyn.unisys.com (128.126.164.2).   There is an X/Ada study team sponsored by NASA JSC, which apparently is working out bindings. Information: xada@ghg.hou.tx.us.  GNU SmallTalk has a beta native SmallTalk binding to X called STIX (by Steven.Byrne@Eng.Sun.COM). It is still in its beginning stages, and  documentation is sparse outside the SmallTalk code itself. The sources are  available as /pub/gnu/smalltalk-1.1.1.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu (18.71.0.38) or  ugle.unit.no (129.241.1.97).

These prolog language bindings depend on having a Quintus-type foreign function interface in your prolog. The developer has gotten it to work with Quintus and  SICStus prolog. Inquiries should go to xwip@cs.ucla.edu. [3/90]  Scheme bindings to Xlib, OSF/Motif, and Xaw are part of the Elk distribution; version 1.5a on export obsoletes the version on the R5 contrib tape.   x-scm, a bolt-on accessory for Aubrey Jaffer's \\\"scm\\\" Scheme interpreter that provides an interface to Xlib, Motif, and OpenLook, is now available via  FTP from altdorf.ai.mit.edu:archive/scm/xscm1.05.tar.Z and  nexus.yorku.ca:pub/scheme/new/xscm1.05.tar.Z.

No.  Once set, the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be  re-read by clients.  The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap, set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The  window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're  sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea()  to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read  back that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and  it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD  and Stuart Marks of Sun]   Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a  (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the  original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved.  [courtesy Jim Fulton, MIT X Consortium]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 139)  How do I create a transparent window?    A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly window. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have several choices:  - the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to make non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers  support the extension.  - a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note  that there is no X notion of a \\\"transparent color index\\\".  - a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny  windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.  - a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly.  [thanks to der Mouse, mouse@lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU, 3/92; see also The X Journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for this last option]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 140)  Why doesn't GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values?   When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a background of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black and White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break.]  If you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be  allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre-computed values.  If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you  can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics  context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over  red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red.  This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and  blue.

Make sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red, green, and blue  fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is  full-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color)  the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is  usually black.

I have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the  standard colormap, but it doesn't work.    XGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does  not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists. Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.  [1/91; from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu)]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 143)  Why does the pixmap I copy to the screen show up as garbage?    The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there  -- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using XFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever  color you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a  mask). [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 144)  How do I check whether a window ID is valid? My program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it.   Because X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window  would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the event without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow  errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed  and its ID reallocated to another window.  [courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?   Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually, the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that  knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except for GCs and private color cells, can be shared].  The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple  applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the applications' running on different machines) is in the first application to  create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into it. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also knows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.  [Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]  Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level  cooperation among your applications.   Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to  use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it  should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.

A number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return  the wrong child of root. A general solution is to add this code or to use it in your own application where you would normally use RootWindow(dpy,screen):  /* Function Name: GetVRoot  * Description: Gets the root window, even if it's a virtual root  * Arguments: the display and the screen  * Returns: the root window for the client  */ #include <X11/Xatom.h> Window GetVRoot(dpy, scr) Display        *dpy; int             scr; { Window          rootReturn, parentReturn, *children; unsigned int    numChildren; Window          root = RootWindow(dpy, scr); Atom            __SWM_VROOT = None; int             i;    __SWM_VROOT = XInternAtom(dpy, \\\"__SWM_VROOT\\\", False);   XQueryTree(dpy, root, &rootReturn, &parentReturn, &children, &numChildren);   for (i = 0; i < numChildren; i++) {  Atom            actual_type;  int             actual_format;  long            nitems, bytesafter;  Window         *newRoot = NULL;   if (XGetWindowProperty(dpy, children[i], __SWM_VROOT, 0, 1,      False, XA_WINDOW, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems,             &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newRoot) == Success && newRoot) {    root = *newRoot;    break;   }  }   return root; }  [courtesy David Elliott (dce@smsc.sony.com). Similar code is in ssetroot, a version of xsetroot distributed with tvtwm. 2/91]  A header file by Andreas Stolcke of ICSI on export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/vroot.h  functions similarly by providing macros for RootWindow and DefaultRootWindow; code can include this header file first to run properly in the presence of a virtual desktop.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 147)  How do I keep a window from being resized by the user?   Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but  there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. You can try setting  the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best.  [1/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 148)  How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times?   It's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself [e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped --  imagine the conflict between two such programs running.    The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily assuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do  this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup  menus or other short parameter-setting windows).  [thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu); 7/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 149)  How do I make text and bitmaps blink in X?   There is no easy way.  Unless you're willing to depend on some sort of extension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself, either by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games with the colormap and changing the color of the contents.  [Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 7/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib?   Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help  get notification of double-clicking.  There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the  protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do  client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you  have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish  implementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of  the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.  Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should be the single-click action or the double-click action.  [Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 4/93]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 151)! How do I render rotated text?    Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics  capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics libraries.  Your only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to render the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it \\\"by  hand\\\" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via  XPutImage(); more specifically:  1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.  2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).  3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.  4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where    a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)   b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)  5) render I2  Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.  The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X  also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS, although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer.  In addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph.

(How do I reserve names?)   There are places in the X Toolkit, in applications, and in the X protocol that define and use string names. The context is such that conflicts are possible if different components use the same name for different things.  The MIT X Consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains: orgainization names, selection names, selection targets, resource types, application classes, and class extension record types; and several others.

The four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?) orbits, while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits.  Since this is the version that launched Mir and the Salyuts (and the add-on modules for Mir), as long as Centaur is smaller than Mir (which I believe it is), it should fit under the shroud.

Do you mean by \\\"omnipotent\\\" that God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless.  To be descriptive, omnipotence must mean \\\"being all-powerful\\\" and not \\\"being able to do anything/everything\\\".  Let me illustrate by analogy. Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the US see fit.  The US would be militarily \\\"omnipotent\\\".  But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current civil war in the former Yugoslavian states.  Technically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to  unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy  of non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to strongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it could actually do, although it had the power to do \\\"whatever it wanted\\\". The US would simply \\\"never want to interfere\\\" for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non-interference policy.  God is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but He cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what He, Himself is.

Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.  value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in  usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus.  The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound.   In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing.  In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the word \\\"value\\\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as \\\"objective values.\\\"  Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow. Just because the word \\\"values\\\" is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts.  If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  So, back to the original question:  And objective morality is.....?  If you can provide an objective foundation for \\\"morality\\\" then that will be a good beginning. \",\"I  am  cleaning  out  the coffers.

We use it for all our B&W image printing. \",\"Hi all,  I'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in Columbus.  I'd like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation consoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.  We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes, and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control circuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.  I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the cue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one problem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be a sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute, so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid cuetape!)  Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function. (A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film) This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second. What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit of some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!

Being a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic, I just don't know what to  think about my Honda.  She was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike  week this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and  was running only on one cylinder.

The US  has never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada  from the Cubans to protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion  of a strategic air strip.

My beliefs are those things which I find to be true based on my experience of the world.  This experience includes study of things that I may not have experienced directly.  But even then, I can only understand the studies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to what I have experienced.  Which means that by beliefs about God are directly related to my experience of God.  Having experienced God, I try to make sense of that experience.  I study religion and read the Bible.  I find things that echo what I have already experienced.  Out of this I build my beliefs.  I also find things that don't match my experience.  That doesn't make them false.  They just don't match my experience.  Maybe I will understand that stuff later.  I don't know.  Maybe all of my beliefs are wrong.  I can change my beliefs.  If someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what. Neither of us are necessarily wrong.  Someone else is making sense out of a different set of experiences.  Even though we have different explanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that the underlying experiences are similar.  Some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one form, and usually has a single revelation.  The more dogmatic and inflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to an outsider.  There is another approach possible, however.  God is a mystery.  I am trying to solve the mystery, so I look at the evidence available to me.  I try to arrive at the best understanding that I can based on the evidence.  New evidence may cause me to change my understanding.  When I encounter someone with a different belief than my own, it isn't a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discover something new about this mystery I can never fully comprehend.

My definition is this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous   Unless one classifies \\\"thinking and informal exploration\\\" as a mistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would consider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as unscientific.     Here is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not clear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be taken as describing what \\\"science is mainly about.\\\"  Consider, for example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and still not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates, that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that some invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are ubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the definition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are \\\"mainly about.\\\"  The misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition.   I agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.    As to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about \\\"absolute scientific truth.\\\"  I think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have proven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of degree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence.    One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim, the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to speculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence was presently available for them, and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)   I think a lot of scientists steer away from things that -- deserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many researchers' minds.    This is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one wants to become this generation's Rhine.   I think this is absurd.     I wonder why the results were not published.  In my field, dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly eases one's defense.)  Finally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either on NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.

The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and  Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding  Ranford. Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom   played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up  Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge  to Sweden in creating more opportunities.  Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi  made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but  Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada  started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked  hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson  who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and  made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.  The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot  that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.  Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took  a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by  the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.  Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure  but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.  At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to  cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.  That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in   the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he  explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close  to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.  Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a  bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas  then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.  The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a  rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds  in the dressing room.   A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing  great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better  than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best  goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.  Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is  easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,  Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.   The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-  Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the  task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.  Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering  that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very  well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because  of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake  on the 1-3 goal.

The Finns took the lead on a Jarkko Varvio slap shot from the  blue line, and a soft goal for an unscreened Mike Richter.  As far as the play in the second period goes, the Finns seemed to have the  most control, so a 1-0 lead was warranted as I saw it.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------       SWEDEN      CANADA   Goaltender: 30 Tommy Soderstrom  30 Bill Ranford   Defense:  8 Kenneth Kennholt   5 Norm Maciver   14 Fredrik Stillman  24 Dave Manson     3 Peter Popovic  25 Geoff Smith   55 Peter Andersson  19 Brian Benning     7 Arto Blomsten   6 Terry Carkner   28 Roger Akerstrom   3 Garry Galley         4 Derek Mayer   Forwards: 29 Mikael Renberg  15 Dave Gagner    9 Thomas Rundqvist  27 Adam Graves   34 Mikael Andersson  22 Mike Gartner    19 Markus Naslund  20 Paul Kariya   21 Peter Forsberg  88 Eric Lindros   18 Jonas Bergqvist   8 Mark Recchi     5 Patrik Juhlin  17 Rod Brind'Amour   20 Jan Larsson    9 Shayne Corson    4 Stefan Nilsson  11 Kevin Dineen    22 Charles Berglund  10 Geoff Sanderson   26 Michael Nylander  12 Greg Johnson   (34 Andersson/18 Bergqvist) 14 Brian Savage        16 Kelly Buchberger \",\" One word \\\"HEAVY\\\".

Christopher\",\"Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or contribution to:  In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine.  The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle (even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of the law is no excuse - they will get you too!  It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors.  Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \\\"no way!\\\"  But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one, and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.  Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.  For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave enlightment may be necessary.  So, the questions are -   What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?   Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by   a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector   antenna?   Are any brands \\\"quieter\\\" than others?\",\" Now you know why I am just a DOD member.

The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if you're grounded in some other way at the same time.    The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.    They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere, repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.)  What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact, depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.  There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and you should probably read it before asking any more questions.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port   If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard  (Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding  a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation  runs the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used  PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable  to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read  the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.   The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.   a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and  even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server  extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your  server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings  appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,  you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,  or bugging your vendor.   kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.  Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.   Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.      2. X terminals   Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use  PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all  set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the  trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add  extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around  for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.      3. NeXT   NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop  Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they  were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of  upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!      4. Silicon Graphics   Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and  beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't  believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not  possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by  upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more  details.      5. IBM RS/6000   IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||  Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||  cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||  smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||  it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||  works.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||  told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||  anything new, please send me e-mail.        ||          6. Other stuff   Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)  support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your  queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can  get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either  from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in  luck.  Contact the companies for more details.   Apple Adjustable Keyboard     Apple Computer, Inc.     Sales offices all over the place.      Availability: February, 1993     Price: $219     Supports: Mac only      Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The     keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate     backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are     arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.      The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.     A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.      The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not     directly attachable to the keyboard.      As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from     TidBITS available there.

Price: $489 (?)     Supports: PC only (highly likely)      Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's     another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both     the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.     The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.      Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will     probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.

The program is called a2x, and is  available via anonymous ftp:   soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/a2x.tar.Z  export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/a2x.tar.Z (most current)   If you want to use your Dragon product with X windows, you may want  to ask for Peter Cohen, an salesman at Dragon who knows more about  this sort of thing.      Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products.     Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles     (including PS/2's and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you     a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number     of popular word processors and spreadsheets.      Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions     to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple     people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file     for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.     On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between     words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.     I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000.      The DragonDictate-30K can recognize 30,000 words at a time.     The DragonWriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time.

The idea is     that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.  The whole pod     tilts in its base, to act as a mouse.

Did you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name?  Before 1827, before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians,  drove all the Turks/Muslims out, it was a Turkish majority town. Well, anyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the  Nazis.   \\\"Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously   pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,   as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and    anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient.\\\"[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,'      Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438.    As a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots)  was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in Boston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but  had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally Tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect of the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian who became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II. In 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central Committee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the  American-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local Armenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20 chapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters and became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization. Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:   \\\"The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.   Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.\\\"[1]  [1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), \\\"The     Armenian Displaced Persons,\\\" in 'Armenian Affairs,' Winter,     1949-50, p. 19, footnote.   Now wait, there is more.  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \\\"Hojali Disaster\\\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \\\"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\\\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \\\"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\\\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \\\"Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\\\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. \\\"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\\\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. \\\"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\\\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \\\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\\\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \\\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\\\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.

Comments   are invited. - Paul )  In alt.privacy.clipper, Steve Bellovin posted your message to him, which included a brief passage concerning selection of agencies as escrow agencies.  I am glad to see that the proposal as written states that the escrow agencies won't be law enforcement agencies. I would argue, however, that *one* of the escrow agencies shouldn't be federal at all.  As a private citizen, I would feel much more \\\"secure in my person and papers\\\" knowing that an organization committed to individual civil liberties- the ACLU and the NRA come to mind- was safeguarding half of my key. Both the ACLU and the NRA are resistent to government pressure by the simple expedient fact that they are not supported, funded, or overtly controlled by the government.  Of those federal and federally funded candidate agencies that you mentioned, I have the following comments:   - SRI, Rand, Mitre, and national labs: I agree that they have         great experience safeguarding sensitive information. I am not         convinced that they would adequately safeguard _this_  information, since in any case requiring disclosure, there's        likely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure- possibly   *wrongful* disclosure.   - GAO: perhaps. I would like to see more concrete evidence of   their fidelity and ability.   - *TREASURY*? Surely you're joking. Perhaps you'd ask BATF  to safeguard keys. Maybe the Federal Reserve would be a   better choice.  Ever since last fall's \\\"trial balloon\\\" was posted in sci.crypt, your name has been synonymous with those who place a great deal of trust in the ability of government agencies and agents to act within the law.  I agree with you in part: those agencies and agents *almost always* act properly.

I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210   and my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need   to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe   place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is   that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it   wrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this   could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.    It could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one   wrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further   correct actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also   my NeXT that way.  Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any   problem, and at pretty high speeds too.  I don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is   pretty standard.\",\"As quoted from <1993Apr17.025258.7013@microsoft.com> by anthonyf@microsoft.com (Anthony Francisco):   That's life.

Your 2F2 cap will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap. The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances, so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering the cold).  You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain, that \\\"rolls over\\\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every 1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would need a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz oscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.  I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.  Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't guarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable conditions.

The explanation    we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult    members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit    of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,    you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule    is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is    incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.  2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were    outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When    questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault    was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were    thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew    you could!  3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,    hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and    referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm    more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not    related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up    some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's    now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by    the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I    was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI    agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say    uncomplimentary.  4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that    the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the    reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing    this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references    to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around    the \\\"He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\\\"    flag.  Sigh.  5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege    reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought    processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button    because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My    only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to    the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to    an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in    the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the    forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In    that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones    Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:    Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and    other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the    BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have    been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it    was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's    paranoid delusions.     --   #include <std_disclaimer.h>\",\"As it says, I'm interested in buying one of the little label-makers, and I can't afford a new one.

Yes, there are still alot of MGBs out there.  The earlier cars (pre  74-1/2) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having  chrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power).  The older cars are  appreciating... slowly.  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the  moment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles. If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car  should last for a long time.  There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere.   The MGB is a great, fun little car.  If she is keeping it solely in the hopes  that it is going to appreciate, tell her to sell it.

Goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal (Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau), but Buffalo has no answer to Neely (not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's one of my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin :) ).  And the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway.  But I think it will go six.   Agreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, or does everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!  Final  I can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for 6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play in the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear territorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will not be putting money on this series. :-)    Agreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent of the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is credit to NY.   Agreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent team, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.   I think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don't think it will go six either...*maybe* five.   If Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They own the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once again I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the Habs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.    Chicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good, IMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.   Very true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out why Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three  at MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.   It _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all.  And yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.    Our first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their size *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team chasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.   This is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough.  I don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a non-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate Gretzky.  LA in six.   If it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be LA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.   Wow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I picked LA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.   If Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet against the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong because they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose, though, I'd have to take the Penguins.  A side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than Gilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from the age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team. I'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while he and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge), Gilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp. from Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best all-round players in the NHL.  \",\" Well, you really can't dig a hole with a stock Shovel; you at least need some performance mods like stroking and cams.

My OpenLook application has a few buttons. The first button turns red(gets highlighted?) as soon as the sprite(mouse) is moved into the application window. How do I suppress this?\",\"(please respond via email!)  Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working?  I'm not having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with O'Reilly's ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net.  The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does (which makes no sense to me).  The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors, apparently because the mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So you can't actually edit any colors.  We have X11 R5 patch level 22; 8-bit pseudoColor visual.  I've poked around  in the xcms code in Xlib, but without some understanding of the theory I have  no idea what's going wrong.  Can somebody confirm if either of the  above-mentioned programs work on their systems, or let me know if they fail  for you too?  Please include what hardware/software/patch levels you have.  Any hints?  Please respond with email as I don't regularly read this group.

What is the nature of eternal life?  2. How can we as mortals locked into space-time conceive of it?  2a. If the best we can do is metaphor/analogy, then what is the  best metaphor?  C S Lewis's essay THE WEIGHT OF GLORY deals with this question. I recommend it enthusiastically. You might also read the chapter on \\\"Heaven\\\" in his book THE PROBLEM OF PAIN. He gives a fictional treatment in his book THE GREAT DIVORCE. I have found all of these very helpful.  You might also be helped by the treatment in Dante's DIVINE COMEDY. Heaven occupies the last third of the poem, but I cannot imagine reading it other than from the beginning. I urge you to use the translation by Dorothy L Sayers, available from Penguin Paperbacks.\",\"I try to unsubscribe from this group by sending an email but that doesn't work.

It is extremely easy to use, make reports, etc.  I own both it and Paradox, and I almost never use Paradox.  If you need to  build up a complicated application, then Paradox is the way to go.  I have heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic. Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/ home use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach.  I  have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily: I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must  be different than what is the logical ordering.  To permanently reorder (to  use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records  appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order) exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach  database), and then copying the exported files back to the original  filename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really  like about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than  the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).  Paradox also  takes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12MB) and RAM).\",\"Dear Folks:  It's a pleasure to be able to announce the release of a new freeware program,  Xavier, an audio and video  extension to InterViews.  Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library that adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite multimedia objects to be built from media objects.  Specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the source code for the original classes (though several configuration files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file).    Currently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN workstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.  Xavier has been tested in the following environments:  SUN:   Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC   OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later   C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1  NEC(EWS):   Machine : EWS4800/210,230   OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2   C++     : C++ Release3.1  It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from            interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/           (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)  We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier. If you are interested, please contact                                    xavier@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp.   I will add your e-mail address to our list.

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger    economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a    lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,    but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing    military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than    just a \\\"we have the money, why not?\\\" approach.  Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European cooperation.  Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of money (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at the size of that multiplier :->).\",\"I have a set of four 235-60-R14 Big O tires that I had on my 1988 Thunder  Bird.

(818) 354-5011  Contact:  Mary A. Hardin  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993 #1506       Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to measure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.       The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airport reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took measurements as part of a program established to correlate data with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).         The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle Discovery.       \\\"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important ways,\\\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on the balloon research campaign.         \\\"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\\\" he continued.  \\\"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists, and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own right.\\\"       The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring.  Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps scientists construct more accurate computer models which are instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.       The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere; a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the atmosphere absorbs sunlight.        Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three- hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130 kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m. Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded to separate from the balloon.       \\\"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurements,\\\" Margitan explained, \\\"and we also needed to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\\\"       It will be several weeks before scientists will have the completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS scientists.           The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon Facility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a contract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.       The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).

Recently, I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 12-15 hours after birth. He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Boston and has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition. This has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with hospitals, procedures...etc.  I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but his condition was termed  quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight as a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs and that did not seem to help out. His MRI, EKG, cat-scans are all normal, but the EEG's show alot of seizure activity. After many metabolic tests, body structure tests, and infection/virus tests the doctors still do not know quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have alot of evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ).

God is just, giving to everyone what they deserve. As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf Romans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole of the human race except Mary, have sinned.  Which is why Jesus said, \\\"Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless he is born of water and Spirit\\\" which is the true meaning of born again (John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.  As St. Augustine said, \\\"I did not invent original sin, which the Catholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a doubt are a follower of a new heresy.\\\"  (De nuptiis, lib. 11.c.12)\",\" This is why I asked to be 'enlightened'.

Again, if we are truely intrested in eliminating the DEBT, we must REMOVE the DEFICIT, and do away with ALL PORK !!!    There have been several books written on gov. waste, network news programs  from time to time devote segments to this, and there have been bills proposed that significantly reduces expenditures without touching external programs by  changing the way 'congress does business' (and make it more efficent).  True, blame is easy, but also is spending someone else's money.    Clinton ran on a platform that he would '...not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these (his) programs'.  He has proposed a program that is not  specific, that counts on tax hikes to pay for.  --  ======================================================================  Ken M.

Thanks very much.\",\" I have been following this thread and figured I'd throw in my two cents...  The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus (7.16 vs 8.33 MHZ). The Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  OS since '85 and can operate with 1 MB RAM!  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.  A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data and moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate even better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape units.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be what I am doing while reading this group.  Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which, thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to completely get rid of IDE. --   Wayne Summer        //        AMIGA - Simply the Best.   Palm Bay, FL.

While I can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area. I rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is more likely to become such a tool, and that it IS such a tool in many instances.   I suspect that this is because \\\"improvement in the human condition\\\" as you define it is not the primary goal of libertarianism, and would not be the primary goal of a libertarian government.

A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are     using them and fewer deem drug use as risky.       For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results     from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is     being won.  But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by     eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students     nationwide.      Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If     drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will     have fewer \\\"drug-using contemporaries\\\" who act as examples of     substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,     one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths \\\"must be given     the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,\\\"     Johnston says.      This type of resurgence \\\"is possible,\\\" says Eileen Shiff, author of     \\\"Experts Advise Parents\\\" (Delta, $14.95).  But that's not the issue,     she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today     could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.      Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with     drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to     their children.  \\\"I've even seen parents serving kegs of beer\\\" to     their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,     Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, \\\"lock-in\\\" party where     no booze or drugs were allowed.  \\\"We need to fulfill that parental     role, otherwise the peer group takes over,\\\" she says.      Officials may \\\"talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven't     done anything that I've seen,\\\" says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,     Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and     other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a     member of USA Today's Teen Panel, says \\\"there's always going to be     experimentation\\\" with drugs.      A real war on drugs could be waged \\\"education-wise,\\\" she says.  But     \\\"some don't want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give     them ideas; it's the same with birth control.  I think you should     give the kids the information or have it accessible\\\" through classes,     pamphlets and speakers, she says.      Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in     kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores,     Fla.  \\\"I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs).  I think     kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds     (about using drugs),\\\" he says.      Scare tactics in public service announcements aren't working; only     one commercial has gotten it right, he says.  The commercial opens     with two \\\"good-looking girls\\\" in the restroom talking about having     no prom date.  Then they take a hit off a joint.  \\\"That hits home     because it's not attractive,\\\" he says.  \\\"You can't be doing drugs if     you want somebody to like you.\\\"       Adolescents' choices      Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:                       Estimated, per 100 students                              1991     1992   Pct. chg.

I think I could have used a Bat-mom. Would have made getting my license a lot easier!  There's a trend here: Stylish helmet, Stylish knee-dragging, rides only in Stylish cartoon precipitation.

We'll write and ask if Batman would like to become an honorary Denizen! Yeah!  Special To The KoTL: Is there a precedent for inducting an imaginary member with an imaginary motorcycle?

Ninja Gourmet Will fight for food.\\u001b  \",\"  Ed of course has never demonstrated remarkable knowlege of socialism,  or any other political system come to that.   That leaves Germany, Japan and the UK as examples of a country where the right wing government is on the verge of collapse. Oh and of course the USA which just elected a socialist government :-)   Etc, unfortunately you can't pin this on the left or the right, both are to blame. Both sides are equally deep into the corruption scandal. The only  untained party is the northern league which is a bunch of nationalist separatists and the communist party which has collapsed.    Ed should take a look at the budget deficit Regan and Bush created together before he starts to make claims about europe collapsing based on the budget deficits here. None of them are serious on the USA scale.  And here in Europe we have zero interest in Ed-Ipser type freed thank you. We do not want our countries to be run by a narrow elite of rich lawyers for the benefit of the super wealthy. We are quite happy with social  democracy and despite the fuss made in Time and Newsweek there is remarkably little being done to reverse the social welfare reforms brought in by socialism.  The problem with socialism is that it started with the aims of free education and health care and provision of the welfare state. This has been achieved across the whole of Europe, only the USA is struggling to catch up. The problem for socialism is what to do now it has succeeded.    Ed starts to discus LA, presumably he thinks that it is in Europe. On the other hand he most probably hasn't heard of a European city.   Rather the opposite. What is happening in Italy is that the communist party has collapsed. This has meant that the grand coalition between right and left wing parties to keep out the communists has also collapsed. The  magistrates have seized this opportunity to crack down hard on fraud and  corruption and have arrested half the politicians. The fact that the socialists are in charge this week is incidental, the right is into the corruption just as baddly.

How modern how daring how liberating How modern how daring how liberating they chant  The sophomore, being American Doesn't know That his ``question''     modern        skeptical            cynical  Was asked before, by a     modern        skeptical            cynical    urbane cosmopolitan  Politician (appointed not elected) Who happened to live two thousand years ago.  Like many politicians he cared      Less about ideals          than results      Less about ends          than means      Less about anything          than keeping his job               (and his head).  We might call him A bit brutal Though `firm' would be kinder (And no doubt Stalin, who let nobody go, laughed at his laxness) He didn't like his job; perhaps he no longer hoped for better (Nor feared worse, except regarding his head).  And when these wily Jews With their heads-I-win, tails-you-lose      conundrums Brought forth their madman, His first impulse was to play the Roman: ``I find nothing wrong with him,   See to it yourselves.''  But when they mentioned `King' and `Caesar' His heart froze.  If he killed their madman     He'd start a riot          and lose his job              (and his head)  If he saved the King of the Jews     He'd piss off Caesar          and lose his job              (and his head)  And when his wife told him to have    Nothing to do with the righteous lout She didn't tell him anything    He hadn't already figured out.  So he punted.  ``Not my jurisdiction!  Take him to see Herod!'' (who just happened to be in town....)  Herod appreciated the courtesy But wasn't worried         And sent the sharp-tongued fool      (Who suddenly didn't have much to say,     funny how people lose it under pressure....)   back In the attire proper   to his Royal State.  His ass is covered---if Herod has no problem, Caesar certainly won't.  The fool can be king of whatever world he wants as long as it's not Caesar's.  ``I'm letting him go,'' he said with a shout. (Looks like he'll last this one out....)  The crowd's reaction puzzled him.   They really wanted him dead. They didn't want the King of the Jews,   They wanted Barabbas instead (And, as Josephus records, they got him)  Oh well, he thought, They all look the same to me. And we'll get Barabbas next time.  And if I can get them to say    ``We have no king but Caesar!''    By killing a madman, Hell, I'll kill ten a day.

Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the visible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.  It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to be useful, but not dangerously so.\",\" Look, guy, I doubt anyone here approves of Drunk Driving, but if he's been caught and convicted and punished maybe you ought to lighten up?

What was \\\"fixed\\\" or changed from 2.0 > 2.2?\",\"I've been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington,  I think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of  etymology.  I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my  childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes.   I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very  angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It  carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some  time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and  `Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To  become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would  consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared  to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a  better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable  riches of knowing Christ.  As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that  they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time  they had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They  didn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.   For example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.    When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her  death, she said to me, \\\"As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew.\\\"  What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a  Jew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with  matzoh balls.:-))   I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My  sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who  do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people  Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.  This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their  experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while  following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.    I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.   It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have  a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small  sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it  and do not want to ask for it back.  And while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.   I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the  Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is  that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again,  being rooted in the past.   This is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess  around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of  Easter).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.  I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all  believers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish  Christian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. \",\" The following postscript works for LaserWriter IIg's with version 2 roms  %! 0 serverdict begin exitserver << /FactoryDefaults true >> setsystemparams systemdict begin realtime 10000 add { dup realtime le { pop exit } if } loop quit\",\"Hi folks,   what exactly is the maximum memory I can put in a Quadra 700.

True, Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still, these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with lots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereas Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.      That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb pitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of a chance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no pitching.  At least, to me.      I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team with Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real order, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but with a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.) Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig, Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.      I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by seasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in their best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all the players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.

The argument was  1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game. 2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%.  3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and earned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12% of defense and pitching is 88% of defense. 4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.  Pete is usually sharper than that. My own feel is that fielding is in the 25-33% of defense range; call it 30-70 between fielding and pitching.   I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe 45-5, or even 40-10.

How do I make a screendump or print my application?   The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window  or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window.  The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr  client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:   csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd & and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current display will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an undocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the  command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for  specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]   Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of  arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc. There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92] is the most recent.  xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders  XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr; see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.  A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information:  soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.  xprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.   To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr, which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps and XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for  use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive servers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.   The XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and save it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.   Also:    Bristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter  2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net in vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.   ColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen- capture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and  non-PostScript printers.   Some vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows)  include session managers or other desktop programs which include \\\"print portion of screen\\\" or \\\"take a snapshot\\\" options. Some platforms also have tools which  can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example,  have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals  have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.   Some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct  support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package  to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?   If you need color PostScript in particular, you can   - grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color  PostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv   - grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS. You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick  distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?   This can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider  instead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?   The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++  Portable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting  among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps,  gray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently; the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.  Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in  particular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary. It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).   Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are  later versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.   Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export;  see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.   xv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley),  can read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF,  GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity,  contrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned  formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on  it, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92;  see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.   The Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>. Conversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available via FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z,  and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.   The Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads and writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.   The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar  to PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*,  weedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.   Xim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential  interactive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is  a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and  Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif,  xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a library and command-line utilities for building your own applications.   ImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from  export's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display images on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF from other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.   xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining simple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90] xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.   A version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool is available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package  also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget.

The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the string which appears in the window titlebar.  A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell:   echo \\\"ESC]2;TEXT^G\\\" where ESC is the escape key, TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed, and ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character).   Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change directories:   alias newcd 'cd \\\\!*; echo -n ESC]2\\\\;$cwd^G'   The digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should  change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name  used in the icon, use the digit '0' instead, and use '1' to change only the  icon name.   Note: another way to do this, which prevents an incorrect display of the local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell, is to wrap the escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself.   Note: on an IBM RS/6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with a ^V.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  29)  Where can I find the xterm control sequences?  The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file  ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z.  O'Reilly's Volume 3, the X User's Guide, includes an R5 version of the control  sequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93, and a Motif version of  the book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version of the control sequences. [1/93]  Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document and also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a  compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100  sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was  published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).  In a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.  [last updated 10/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm, et al, fail against the R4 server? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?   In order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to  \\\"stty pass8\\\" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as   XTerm*font:  -*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1  XTerm*boldfont: -*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 [The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]  In addition, you may want to set this in your shell:  setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1          For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with  the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using `man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (')  is Alt-'.

You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give  a resource specification like this:   xterm*geometry: 80x24 then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to 80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size.  But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:   xterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?   You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command.  However, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for  manipulating the selection will help; e.g.   % xselection PRIMARY | lpr finds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a  window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties. A version is on export.  Also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be adapted to do this.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?   You can use several environment variables to control how resources are  loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and  XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for  application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.   Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a  way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies. Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also  have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could  set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up  app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located):  setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N  The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see  XtResolvePathname()):          %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the                 application's class name.         %T      The value of the file \\\"type\\\".  In this case, the                 literal string \\\"app-defaults\\\"         %C      customization resource (R5 only)         %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.         %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \\\"ja_JP.EUC\\\")         %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \\\"ja\\\")         %t      The territory part of the display's language string         %c      The codeset part of the display's language string   Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is  \\\"Myterm\\\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the  example omits locale-specific lookup.)  /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm  $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm   As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above  app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it  and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to  search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.   Let's consider another example. This time, let's set  XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working  directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.  setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N   The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands  to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging  because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file  Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and %S are useless.   With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization  resource value.  For example, you might run the \\\"myterm\\\" application like this:  myterm -xrm \\\"*customization: -color\\\"   If one of your pathname specifications had the value \\\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\\\" then the expanded pathname would be \\\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\\\" because the %C substitution character  takes on the value of the customization resource.   The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:   /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N   (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.)   The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is    <root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   <root>/%L/%N:\\\\   <root>/%l/%N:\\\\   <root>/%N:   <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory  if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other  than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.   Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find  your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR  to \\\".\\\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3  compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \\\"./\\\", a dot followed  by a slash.  [Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?  The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources; for example,  your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line   DisplayManager.0.authorize: false  to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also   DisplayManager*xrdb: /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:  #!/bin/sh  #comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources  /usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap  /usr/bin/X11/xrdb $* Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.  Note that this is a  general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client.  [Thanks to Jay Bourland (jayb@cauchy.stanford.edu), 9/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  36)  Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my .xsession file?   When xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login files. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script; or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and source it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or, if you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your  .xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting your .xsession file off with \\\"#!/bin/csh\\\".   If this doesn't work, also try starting off with:   #!/bin/sh   # Reset path:   PATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?   There are several ways to avoid having to do a \\\"setenv DISPLAY ...\\\" whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.  One solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It  includes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and xrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine. A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.  One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from 132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and $DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then  propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain   eval `xrlogind` where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special  format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to  recreate the environment variables. [11/90]   In addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on  another host, and you find   rsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY  too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh  can be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be    xrsh <HOST> xterm    #! /bin/sh   # start an X11 process on another host   # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT   # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu>   # rsh $host -n \\\"setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null\\\"   #   # An improved version:   # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson, jr@bbn.com)   #       (generalized for sh,ksh by Keith Boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu)   #   # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.

One way is to use the \\\"bitmap\\\" client or some other bitmap-editor (e.g. Sun's icon-editor tool, post-processed with pbmplus) to design the individual  characters and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate  them into the BDF format. See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X  Journal for more information.  The R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained  a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.  An easier way is to use the \\\"xfed\\\" client to modify an existing font; a version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is  available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63],  possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce BDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.  The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors, XPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in /pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed  [5/91] in export:/contrib.   If you are a MetaFont user you can use \\\"mftobdf\\\" from the SeeTeX distribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe, a font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.  The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these tools to modify a font.  Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?   After you have built the font using your system's font-compiler,  installed it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent (e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp  $dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the  directory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably  leaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in  the path.)  Sometimes your \\\"xset +fp $dir\\\" command fails with a BadValue error:   X Error of failed request:BadValue    (integer parameter out of range for operation)   Major opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)   This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The mention of an \\\"integer parameter\\\" in the message is spurious.)  -- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file    system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your    font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an    xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \\\"xset +fp ~/myfonts\\\") and    the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.  -- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server    (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file    \\\"fonts.dir\\\".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're    running OpenWindows, look for the file \\\"Families.list\\\".  If you can't find    it, run bldfamily(1).)  -- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a    proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for    example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.    Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for    Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work    for X11Rn.

A tool called \\\"snftobdf 1.4\\\" is part of the bdftools package, which is  available from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from  crl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?   der Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and  produces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be  used as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can  understand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools  such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail  from mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]  In addition, the R5 program \\\"fstobdf\\\" can produce bdf for any font that the R5 server has access to.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?   The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation, but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file  contrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is  for a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for  creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers  which do not use the MIT font scheme.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  43)  How do I add \\\".bdf\\\" fonts to my DECwindows server?   The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the \\\".pcf\\\" format. You can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc font-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a performance hit.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?) I want to be able to do something like this:  xclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave   You can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the  same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because  of this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since  there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore,  neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap  converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a  resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for  use in many of its widgets, however. [courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]  However:  A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of  the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick  (basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of  image formats as a pixmap.   The leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used  by Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by AT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM  distribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write  routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information on the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on  the R5 contrib tape. [A set of XPM icons collected by Anthony Thyssen  (anthony@kurango.cit.gu.edu.au) is on export in contrib/AIcons.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  45)  Why can't I override translations? Only the first item works.   You probably have an extra space after the specification of the first  item, like this:  basic*text.translations:  #override \\\\  Ctrl<Key>a:    beginning-of-line() \\\\n\\\\    Ctrl<Key>e:    end-of-line()            ^ extra space The newline after that space is ending the translation definition. [Thanks to Timothy J. Horton, 5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  46)  How can I have xclock or oclock show different timezones?   One solution is xchron, in Volume 6 of comp.sources.x, which can show the time for timezones other than the local one.   Alternatively, you can probably set the timezone in the shell from which you invoke the xclock or oclock, or use a script similar to this:  #!/bin/sh  TZ=PST8PDT xclock -name \\\"San_Luis_Obispo_CA\\\" 2> /dev/null &  TZ=EST5EDT xclock -name \\\"King_Of_Prussia_PA\\\" 2> /dev/null &  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  47)  I have xmh, but it doesn't work. Where can I get MH?   The xmh mail-reader requires the Rand MH mail/message handling system, which is not part of the UNIX software distribution for many machines. A list  of various ftp, uucp, e-mail and US-mail sites for both xmh and MH is given in  the monthly MH FAQ; one source is ics.uci.edu in the file pub/mh/mh-6.7.tar.Z. If you do not receive the comp.mail.mh newsgroup or the MH-users mailing list,  you can request a copy of the FAQ, which also includes a section on xmh,  by sending mail to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu containing the request \\\"send usenet/news.answers/mh-faq\\\".  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  48)  Why am I suddenly unable to connect to my Sun X server? After a seemingly random amount of time after the X server has been started, no other clients are able to connect to it.   The default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun (for 4.0.3, at least) delete \\\"old\\\" (unreferenced) files from /tmp -- including /tmp/.X11-unix, which  contains the socket descriptor used by X. The solution is to add \\\"! -type s\\\" to the find exclusion in the cron job.

How do I get my Sun Type-[45] keyboard fully supported by Xsun?   Many users wants the Num Lock key to light the Num Lock LED and have the  appropriate effect on the numeric keypad. The Xsun server as distributed by MIT doesn't do this but there are two different patches available.   The first patch is written by Jonathan Lemon and fixes the Num Lock related  problems. It is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in the file contrib/Xsun-R5.numlock_patch.Z .   The second is written by Martin Forssen and fixes the Num Lock and Compose keys and adds support for the different national keyboard layouts for Type-4 and  Type-5 keyboards. This patch is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/sunkbd1216-0314.tar.Z or via email from maf@dtek.chalmers.se.   [thanks to Martin Forssen (maf@dtek.chalmers.se or maf@math.chalmers.se), 8/92]  A set of patches by William Bailey (dbgwab@arco.com) was posted to newsgroups 11/92 to provide support for the Type-5 keyboard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  51)  How do I report bugs in X?   Generally, report bugs you find to the organization that supplied you with the X Window System. If you received the R5 source distribution directly  from MIT, please read the file mit/bug-report for instructions. [Look in mit/doc/bugs/bug-report in R4.]  [Thanks to Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>, 5/91; 12/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  52)  Why do I get \\\"Warning: Widget class version mismatch\\\"?   This error, which typically goes on to say, \\\"widget 11004 vs.  intrinsics 11003\\\" indicates that the header files you included when building  your program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking  against was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure.  However, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the  X11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun OW systems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library,  and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you have seen.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  53)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster?   Webster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster's Dictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became aware that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster  and gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access.  [The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. A Webster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu  (129.79.254.192) in \\\"pub/webster/NeXT-2.0\\\".]  Unless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site which can grant you access, you are probably out of luck.    However, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up the latest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file  xwebster.README includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and  non-availability of dictionary servers.

No. The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not  \\\"public domain\\\", which has a specific legal meaning. However, the X  distribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee.  Contributed software, though, may be placed in the public domain by individual authors.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  56)  How compatible are X11R3, R4, and R5? What changes are there?  The Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the  previous release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility  across releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary,  details are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the  network also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the  file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.

The Itar-TASS news agency announced the launch of Cosmos 2238 from  Plesetsk Cosmodrome, but provided little description of the payload's mission.       However, based on the satellite's trajectory, Western observers  identified it as a military spacecraft designed to monitor electronic  emissions from foreign naval ships in order to track their movement.       Geoff Perry of the Kettering Group in England... [said]  Western  observers had concluded that no more would be launched. But days after the  last [such] satellite re-entered the Earth's atmosphere, Cosmos 2238 was  launched.   \\\"Cosmos-2238\\\" Satellite Launched for Defense Ministry Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian  1238 GMT 30 March 1993 Translated in FBIS-SOV-93-060, p.27 by ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova      Moscow, 30 March -- The Cosmos-2238 satellite was launched at 1600 Moscow  time today from the Baykonur by a \\\"Tsiklon-M\\\" carrier rocket. An ITAR-TASS  correspondent was told at the press center of Russia's space-military forces  that the satellite was launched in the interests of the Russian Defense  Ministry. \",\"  First of all, \\\"ceremonial law\\\" is an extraScriptural term.  It is sometimes used as a framework to view Scripture.  But if you look at Collosions, without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be  a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.  against us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days, or the keeping of the sabbath.  The word for sabbath in this verse is \\\"sabbaton\\\" and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.  If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption \\\"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law\\\" then he will have to find some way around it, like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the 7tH day, Because \\\"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.\\\"  But Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal  statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings.  Also, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which talks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society that did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were slaves.  It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath if it had been mandatory.  Why is there no mention of this in the epistles?\",\"I think I've seen this bike.

Can we perhaps as the question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal to the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written with something else in mind and \\\"propoganda\\\" put out by its supporters.         But let's be honest about something, here.  When was the last time you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?         Or are they simply propogranda?  We can't know what Phill *really* means because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince.          If they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why on earth did you make a point of calling them \\\"propogranda?\\\"  That would seem to be irrelevent.          Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe they no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were good arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.          Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political system, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this particular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure and tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)           In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have had less power?           Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although badly) to the U.S. President.          Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives is \\\"in principle\\\" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate) but in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put those extra restrictions on the Senate in?         Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of government to \\\"attack\\\" which presents them with the best chance of getting what they want.  With national \\\"interest groups\\\" it is simply a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a law rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less  \\\"contributions\\\" to make.          Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at the Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance, medicine, and most other questions.        Local government has not \\\"failed\\\" in that it hasn't done what it should, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their rules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout, only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose its will on the lower.        I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus- and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed to a local crime?        The more people want the more Congress will take power to \\\"sell\\\" it to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of \\\"special interests\\\" is coincidence with the increased power of Congress.          Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness.          Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable of educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the \\\"pork\\\" in that state.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get what they want, individual voices have more relative impact.         The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must \\\"buy off\\\" states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.          But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself  that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem is significantly reduced.          The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable to action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those decisions a good thing.          The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is harder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing new deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out without a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different areas, different solutions may be called for.         And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local and state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to the city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in Washington with half a million or more constituents.         I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels are more corrupt.            Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators should be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was suppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this. Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders wanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them, I never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution, which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for the House.          The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration of Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other examples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the reasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)          To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something it wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which almost necessitates its abuse.          *BUSH?*  Phill, that's absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of which was over-ridden.  Go read up on FDR if you think that's anything resembling a record.          Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system against action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have not been successful.  When you're in a position of imposing federal power on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to got through something more than a bare majority          Now we're switching from a general question of a fillibuster to a specific bill.  I don't see how it make a difference.          Sure it's arguable.  Theyr'e *arguing* it.  However, requiring 60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they'll have to have a *good* argument.  Something that isn't based solely on party lines.          No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority for *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough about.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don't advocate the minority being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing the *federal* system against action. \",\"does anyone have Prez.

Frankly, the Saturn way of doing business and service was a *very* big plus. I hadn't bought a new car since I bought my Honda 4WD back in '85, and I was unbelieveably offended by most salespeople I met.  Saturn was indeed very different. I made three different visits to the dealer where I bought my car, and was never pressured. Saturn also had the best after-sales support, and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly what I wanted to buy. Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the dealer. He's been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a Saturn, based on what he's seen and heard from his customers.   Saturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year/60K miles,  fully refunded if you don't use it. That works out to an actual cost of $170 or so, based on the 6 year treasury rates. Using savings account rates it's more like $120. In the first three years it also buys you free rental during any warranty work, without counting against the refund.\",\" I think this is a weak argument.  The fact is, there are *two* references to Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least been altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage says the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for Jesus and may be authentic.    There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference to Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which lack the references.  It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but I don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in the scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes this position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view that Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to the historicity of Jesus.)\",\"Ditto...

Chiu knows the score and is just being silly. However, \\\"decibel\\\" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is right on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.  Strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels, and a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel, hence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).  The bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are all named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fine way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field. Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers, but had been left out in having a term or unit named after him until recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.) All the other units were defined many decades earlier.       --  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    \",\"I am using a 8507 IBM monitor (19\\\" greysale) with a Trident (1MB) card.

Oak Park also has an illegal handgun ban as well, but does allow those with a \\\"collectors FFL\\\" to possess (\\\"collectible?\\\") handguns.   Probably a fine in practical terms.   It wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident in Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a handgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand, a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend himself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA Director who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided not to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs has it's own drawbacks, like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his house, and told him: \\\"this is stepping over the line; this could get dangerous for you.\\\" Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers watched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief and his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family.

She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she  believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.   (Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the  food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit forming) ?  This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are: Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in  pet food?  ----------------------------------- I speak for myself and not Motorola -----------------------------------  \",\"Is anyone out there running a MS-DOS system with a LocalTalk board?

This topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion flap started.  As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice. They showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as hydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman constant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out of kilter, and you get sick and die.  I've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real life.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this book, I would imagine you would have to:  1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy    water.  2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other    molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.  During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingested was heavy.  You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both alarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here.  Come to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was no longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.  The most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids would literally be \\\"heavy\\\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and heavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by about 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that the victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test involving the specific gravity of a body fluid?

Arab governments generally don't care much about the Palestineans and their struggle but find it useful for political purposes back home. They are happy to leave the Palestineans largely under Israeli control because that leaves the job of controlling them to the Israelis.  The Israelis don't like this job any more than King Hussein of Jordan liked it -- and he managed to kill them off at the rate of thousands per month when they started an Intifada in Jordan.  The governments of Syria, Lebanon and Egypt all feel similarly.  However, proclaiming public support for the Palestinean war against Israel deflects criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to even the most brutal Arab tyrants.  Arab *PEOPLE* probably aren't much more sympathetic.  Palestineans have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in Jordan, Lebanon and Kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere.  You might still be right in sympathy to the war against Israel, but I suspect that many Arabs, far removed from the immediate border with Israel (e.g. in Kuwait or Morroco), couldn't care less. \",\"  Okay Mr. Dyer, we're properly impressed with your philosophical skills and ability to insult people.

In comparison, in  the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall  decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in  gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of  this disease from 1985 through 1992.       In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department  of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992,  reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively  (Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics  (15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases  with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7%  of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by  age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or  equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all  reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the  largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age  group-specific rate (639 per 100,000).       Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver  metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the  state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area  occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods  considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.       When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among  men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in  the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits  by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases  diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men,  the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised  94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among  self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992,  respectively).       Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO,  university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted  to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea  culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased  23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the  fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).       From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and  Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado  increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992,  the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for  whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000)  (Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from  1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases  increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.

Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992  may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more  complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH  surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea  cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories  suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact.  However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning  laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the  gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.       One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in  Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a  recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs  (2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area  coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires  further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated  previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6)  -- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom  gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs,  and gang affiliation.       The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the  national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective  19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for  gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at  greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race- specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as  socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.       In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado,  interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting  partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at  increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black  males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in  schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted  primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to  perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational  interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of  members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders  and health-care providers.

Child safety seats and safety  belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50  states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety  belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by  an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major  cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of  occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for  those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In  addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to  use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between  adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints  for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC  analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  (BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this  study.       Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to  18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based,  random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury  Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499  (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent  was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for  that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in  this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than  consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up).  Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software  for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates  and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined  by p values of less than 0.05.       Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six  (Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no  law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania,  and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a  vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse  of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary  enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a  safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states  used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use.  The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law  requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law  (no-law states).       Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not  consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and  adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square  test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus  43.2%, respectively).       High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1  year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than  consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported  high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age  (range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for  adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child- occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1%  for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of  consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult  safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age  groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).       Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded  that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition,  higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with  increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated  with increased adult safety-belt use (8).   Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National  Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others  indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely  to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these  nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit  other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater  risk for motor-vehicle injury (10).       Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with  child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs  should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low  educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such  programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve  low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are  directed at parents with young children.       Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In  addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment,  those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do  not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety  belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and  safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may  increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers --  the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the  highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES                                IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC                          AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88        Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance  systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance  in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for  the years 1983-1988.       Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program  and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population- based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The  prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983- 1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan  Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race,  sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.       Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal  alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the  kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general  diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand  limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are  probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these  defects are relatively easy to diagnose.       Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy  termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However,  the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be  related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene  pool, or random variation.       Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several  collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in  the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on  the impact of prenatal diagnosis.

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89       Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza  virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually  from October through May.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance  conducted from October 1988 through May 1989.       Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices  of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO  collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza  viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and  territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians.  Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received  throughout the year.       Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B  viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency  overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted  over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices  of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were  similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of  identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype  increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the  1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were  reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza  A(H1N1).       Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of  influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the  importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since  amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.       Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced  throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make  informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual  surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates  for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.  Authors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona                   High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies  Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF- ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been  developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT),  embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together,  these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive  technology (ART) procedures.   Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or  pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility  management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to  proceed with one of the ART procedures.   Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility  service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and  Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in  ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients  in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the  traditional therapies.   The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our  Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the  realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are:   o in vitro  o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube    transfer  o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation.  This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed  towards improved success of these technologies.

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then  subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA  amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization.   There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by  other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and  hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ  hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of  which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit  sex-linked disorders.   The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that  it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility  of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth  of affected children.

In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our  Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of  unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and  the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred  to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under  strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being  processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our  andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to  perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically  stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing  hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo  lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs  obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic  egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia,  we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our  Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.        Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal  deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male  factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall  success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per  cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173  IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.       Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is  disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological  factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well  recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous  ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle  attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant  of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an  Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of  traditional therapies.       The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not  been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs  available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates  significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years;  and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is  unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our  Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may  be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that  fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant  proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently,  the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our  program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs  of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.        GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room,  usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves  introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian  tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization  occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF,  with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for  transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such  pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility  and/or idiopathic infertility.          The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990  indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained  with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36  percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might  expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our  program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while  substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the  patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing  a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing  general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from  obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs,  and the developmental competency of resultant embryos.       The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial  environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between  January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT  cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.       Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when  embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos.  This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for  success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical  issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated  by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from  both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs  should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.       Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new,  is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but  who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in  combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10  percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the  procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under  the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm  through enzymatic digestion.       Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10  percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly  relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm.  Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques  for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such  efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology  offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to  establish conception.

That is, we  observe in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced  by a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be  its own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.  God, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject  to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being,  God's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence  of a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the  supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused  phenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the  supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very  nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.  This is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted  to clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the  natural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being  interchangeable.\",\" Yes.

It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   \\\"program\\\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even   hole filling.    The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.    GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,   documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been   developed by Spyglass.

It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,   tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting   things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of   images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined   convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw   data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also   does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,   though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac   that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version   from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)  PhotoMac --------   Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700  PhotoPress ----------   Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973  PixelTools and TCL-Image ------------------------   \\\"Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications   software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,   blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,   EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,   PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the \\\"auto selection tool\\\"   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close   hues, color range and mask.

One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by \\\"painting\\\" it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator \\\"paint\\\" with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr.

Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: \\\"Laplacian, medium noise filter\\\", etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,   the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu   (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)   Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,   VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic, etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is   available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - \\\"AIPS++\\\" - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and   Australia to name a few.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using   the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Been around for   a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000   with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display\\\"  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil   exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual   pages, and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.   For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun   console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X   windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of   convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,    byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or    without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,    line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp    masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,    line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan    bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to    region target mean, median, or modal value. o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,    brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive    background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical    aperture shape to image isophotes.  o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot    of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`    centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,    change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and    adjust cursor size on image.

As an organization their fundamental purpose is to translate the scriptures into the native languages which in terms usual means learning it and  developing a written language (along with teaching the natives to read). It is not associated with the U.S. govt. at all.  Many governments want the help of the translators.  To the best of my knowledge the  Mexican government now encourages them to come.  Their idea is not cultural interference but the presentation of the Good News.  To understand more about what they do, I suggest you read some of the books (autobiographical and biographical) about some of the translators.  One that stands out in my mind as an excellent is called \\\"Peace Child.\\\" This would give a true picture of what their mission is.  I agree with this statement, but we cannot also accept what others say without looking into the issues.  That would be the same as taking  Suddan's discussion about the CIA, etc. as being true.

(No-one has said how it will be modulated - want a bet it's a non-standard and hence easily recognisable baudrate?)  Devices to scan exchanges and detect modems etc already exist.  I've seen them advertised in the trade press.  Once you eliminate crippled crypto devices and ordinary data modems, what's left is crypto worth looking more closely at.

I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in \\\"contraceptive technology\\\" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.    Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't we teach \\\"safe drug use\\\" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it because we know that a class in \\\"how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs\\\" would increase drug use?  Why isn't \\\"drug abstinence education\\\" barred from schools because it teaches \\\"religion\\\"?  Aren't we abandoning those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe use?  \",\"We have recently purchased a Tektronix xterminal, and I'm having a problem with it.

JCAG and SDPA claim responsibility.   Source: Edward K. Boghosian, \\\"Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity Meeting,\\\" The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.  ATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties, including the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both Armenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the  Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.  The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of the Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of ASALA...  Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian people, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal... Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement  was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam  Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued  support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause,  pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be  open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr.  Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that  his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that this policy will continue. \\\"The doors of our camps are always open to  Armenian freedom fighters,\\\" he affirmed.  Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet; two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of the Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations, a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.  More than significant was the large number of messages received by the  organizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary Movement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.                   SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM  Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will continue to \\\"reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,\\\" to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag \\\"Bureau.\\\" The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement, open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.  The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the Greek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence. The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)    First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You  called Serdar Argic a liar!..  I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...  (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)    And now, you are lying again and talking about \\\"modified,re-published book\\\" (without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..  (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was   first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty    well suited theories', as usual)    And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who  wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number  and page numbers again for the library use, which are:                    949.6 R 198       and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215                           Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying \\\"it is  not possible...\\\" ..If not, what is your point?    Differences in the number of pages?  Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..  No need to use the same book size and the same letter   charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!    The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year  first published..   And you tried to hide the whole point..  the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about  how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given   by Serdar Argic exist!!   It was the issue, wasn't-it?      you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway?     You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a \\\"crap\\\"..

The working of both drivers is totally the same.  When I ran dos, I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat, because some programs won't run with some drivers and I could choose the ones I needed during startup. But with DRDOS6, this advantage is gone, because DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.  Michael\",\"  Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this approach.  It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences. The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case. You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits?  There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently, because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor- General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting.   Some people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating food that they have harvested themselves.  The pleasure derived from hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables grown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much  freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or the supermarket).   By \\\"cannot now be justified\\\" I guess you mean that you personally don't see any justification.  Fine--but what makes your opinion so important?   Certainly the last point is correct.

(I'm just assuming an Intel/Windows environment). Thanks in advance. --Jerry\",\"     I don't doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders. It's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology, and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, the proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what exists now.      The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs, probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say) a DES keysearch machine.      As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination could acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since it would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked jodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency or organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak- nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for (say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the complaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars to build a keysearch machine for.)      How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?  How about home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers? \\\"Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately. Maybe I can help...\\\"        Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistant to \\\"practical cryptanalysis.\\\"  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how several NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.  And NSA confidential data was *not* subject to being requested by thousands of police organizations and courts across the land.\",\"The DEA and other organizations would have the American people believe that we are winning the \\\"war on drugs\\\".  I'm going to dispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showing you the drug war's *real* status. To help prove my assertions I've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearly demonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on the rise.  If WOD is working, as we're led to believe, then drug abuse should have gone down substantially by now.  The reality is, is that it has not gone down very much.  If anything, substance abuse is on the rise.  I'm also going to supply a possible solution to this problem.  The following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music and pot entitled \\\"Hello Again, Mary Jane\\\" which appears in the current issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59).      Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing     smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed.  \\\"Perhaps     because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby     is out in full force,\\\" says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug     Enforcement Administration.  \\\"The fact is, they're losing the     battle.\\\"  In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said     they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner     says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that     studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of     nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.

I think you can see that one of the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that the \\\"war on drugs\\\" is being won is to selectively quote statistics--- only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone down.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is an excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to deceive the public.  Usage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same time usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution). Also, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down but drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore, if one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all* the statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called \\\"war on drugs\\\" is being lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs go, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants, then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed in its true perspective.  For those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then try drinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me that it's not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal* drugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless attempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to another drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.  The solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to legalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be within reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a few times) and then couple this with a massive drug education program. The reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution is because people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the government's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug interdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug education).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime because the profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often goes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact that addicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their money and posessions in order to support their expensive habit; legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall substantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.  IMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been done to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to employ heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating them.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less than they used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought about by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can light up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in order to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methods be used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried out.  They are as follows:      * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which       states the possible health hazzards involved with using this       product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.       Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used       ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.      * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of       revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs       through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from       drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law       enforcement.      * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of       18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the       taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.       Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning       information should also be a felony.      * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the       purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This       agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad       drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.  I'm sure that many of the things I've discussed in this article have been hashed out before in this newsgroup.

Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants in the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.      The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them, including data from state and federal agencies.      The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the governments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a \\\"a massive spying operation.\\\"      The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.      Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.      The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that Gerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.      The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles.      The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California, which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources. It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as other unspecified damages.      Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his wife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.      One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence Minister.      Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.      According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both kept information on thousands of California political activists.      In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and Bullock received confidential information from the authorities.      No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing.   REUTER AC KG CM    APn  04/14 2202  ADL Lawsuit  Copyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.  By CATALINA ORTIZ  Associated Press Writer    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued the Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy by illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network.    The ADL, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, intended to use the data to discredit them because of their political views, according to the class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court.    \\\"None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hate crimes, or any of the other `isms' that the ADL claims to protect against. None of us is violent or criminal in any way,\\\" said Carol El-Shaieb, an education consultant who develops programs on Arab culture.    The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense Minister Moshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably because he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians.    \\\"The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks politically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite,\\\" Arens said.    The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit because it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL's New York headquarters.    The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that the ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including white supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco public television station KQED.    Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government records, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit. No charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.    The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law, which forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information \\\"not otherwise public\\\" from state or federal records.    The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to \\\"persons and entities\\\" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate.    Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL's office in San Francisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.    Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADL informant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard. Gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed information on to Bullock.    Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines. Bullock's lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit because he had not yet studied it.

One of the advantages and draw-backs of requiring proof on the part of the government before they may take action against citizens.  (and part of the reason some of us believe weapons should be available.)          We are not arguing the absolute sanctity of the U.S. Constitution.  In fact, the fillibuster we're talking about isn't *in* the Constitution.  I objected to your suggestion that the Senate wasn't intended to exercise the power it was clearly given.          I'll point out again that Reagan only had a Republican Majority in the Senate during his first term, and his coalition in the House came apart at about the same time.  Bush never had any real support in Congress.         The real point is that everybody, *everywhere* got their pork, from the big corporations to the guy I saw last night leaving a convenience store with an armful of junk-food he'd bought with food stamps.  (He spent more in food stamps on junk than I *make* in a week and I'm not on government assitance.)          Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.         In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billion dollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase of approx. 884 billion dollars.         In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In 192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars. That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccounted for.  (This represented an increase of 230%)         In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs, Housing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare) cost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, or more than national defense started.  (This represented an increase of 230%)         In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars on Medicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of 368%)         In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housing credits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.         In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billion dollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.         Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.         Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.         Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.         Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.         Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.         Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.              About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under  the Energy category, primarily under \\\"Supply,\\\" and \\\"Community Development,\\\" in the area of \\\"disaster relief,\\\" and between the two of them represent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.         Where *was* this huge diversion?          Not that's a stretch.  If the current government was pushed by the President to create this mess, wouldn't one expect it to begin to equalize once the pressure is gone?          Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want to continue. I see very little positive about it.          The Constitution was *designed* to frustrate the democratic process, so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting what they wanted by the time it happened.  Nor do I see putting the brakes on the \\\"democratic process\\\" an inherently bad thing.  Califronia's riding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense it gets worse.          Sometimes, or perhaps most of the time, the people should be told, \\\"no,\\\" and pointed to their local government.                 Phill, would you do me the very great favor of repeating that in talk.politics.guns?          Cute.  We can eliminate violations of the law by eliminating the law.          Free speech alone is dangerous, Phill.          OK, Phill.  All you gotta show me is a clear pattern of *reduction* in homicide rates across several countries and that'll be it.  (Not current, mind, you, reduction.)            Who's chaining anything to freedom of speech?  By *calling* it a freedom?            Phill, you're a master of subtly changing the subject.  I haven't *based* my argument against raw democracy on the Constitution.  I've tried to explain why it isn't a good idea.  The only time I've referred to the Constitution is to point out it doesn't contain the restrictions on the veto and the Senate you appear to believe were \\\"meant,\\\" but just didn't make it in there.              The Constitution doesn't *contain* the 41% fillibuster rule. I only believe that the rule is a good idea.  You cn't dismiss that as venerating the Constitution because it isn't *in* the Constitution.\",\"        Tennessee, at least, does not require any sort of safety class to get a driver's license.  All that is required is one twenty question quiz and to drive a car around the block without crashing.         In all probability, no you don't.  You are required to be licensed to drive on public roads.  A license is not necessary on private property.          Most states do not require the registration of cars that are not used on public roads.  Those that do (California I know of) do so for tax purposes more than anything else.              Many states do not currently require this, and most, again, only make this requirement for public roads.  A car sitting unused  is not required to have insurance.          The two are not the same, as I pointed out above.  There are significant difference between making rules for *use on public property* and *making rules for ownership*.         The other half of the objection is trust.  Similar things to this have been tried in many local jurisdications across the country, and have been abused in far too many cases.   Safety classes which are never sheduled, never funded, or only one or two is held a year for a limited number of participants.  Registration lists in New York, Chicago, and California have been used for confiscation.  *Many* gun owners would, in theory, support these planes.

This happens to many of my friends and relatives too.  And, heh, we eat Chinese food all the time at home :) (but we don't use MSG when we're cooking for ourselves)  So, when we put one and one together, it can be safely assumed that MSG may cause some allergic reactions in some people.  Stick with natural things.  MSG doesn't do body any good (and possibly harms, for that matter).  So, why bother with it?

Mr. Natural?\\\", pinkboys will buy darn near *anything*, which means: 2) There's still plenty of $$$$ to be made in the False Jesus business by enterprising SubGenii.  Just remember that: 3) Once you've separated the pinks from their green, don't blow it all on automatic weapons from Mexico.  Put it in a Swiss bank account.  Smile a lot.  Have your flunkies hand out flowers in airports.  The Con will just shrug you off as long as: 4) You never, never, NEVER start to believe your own bulldada!  If \\\"David Koresh\\\" hand't started swallowing his own \\\"apocalypso now\\\" crap, he'd be working crossword puzzles in the Bahamas today instead of contributing to the mulch layer in Waco.  This is because: 5) When you start shooting at cops, they're likely to shoot back.  And  most of 'em are better shots than you are.   In short:  - P.T. Barnum was right    and  - Stupidity is self-correcting Thus endeth the lesson.\",\" Indeed, if the color teal on a team's uniforms is any indication of the future, the Marlins are in dire trouble! Refer to the San Jose Sharks for proof... But I have hope for the Marlins. I was a sometime member of the Rene Lachemann fan club at the Oakland Coliseum, and have a deep respect for the guy. He's a gem. And, of course, Walt Weiss gives that franchise class. But yeah... whoever designed those uniforms was guilty of a paucity of style and imagination. Ugghhh!\",\"[...]   I struggled with the margin problem for ages as well, until I finally got hold of the shareware binary editor BEAV133, and dug into NOTEPAD.EXE (there is no SETUP facility to force NOTEPAD to default to  0.0 margins- it's hardwired into code!!!).    Do a SEARCH for \\\".75\\\", then change the offending bytes to \\\".00\\\",  et viola. Who are the guys who hardcode these \\\"options\\\" anyway?   I'm interested in whether the problem only rears it's ugly head for  certain printers- I'm using an old Epson LX-800 (or is that EX-800? never can  remember).\",\"hey... I'm pretty new to the wonderful world of motorcycles... I just bought a used 81 Kaw KZ650 CSR from a friend.... I was just wondering what kind of  saddle bags I could get for it (since I know nothing about them)  are there bags for the gas tank?  how much would some cost, and how much do they hold? thanks for your advice!!!  I may be new to riding, but I love it already!!!! :)  \",\"Hello netters  Sorry, I don't know if this is the right way of doing this kind of thing, probably should be a CFV, but since I don't have tha ability to create a  news group myself, I just want to start the discussion.

I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted Flakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.  Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think \\\"Oh, oh, this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.\\\"  Ten  minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.  When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even he is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when a person has a seizure.  Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you can guess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there has.  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get across what is going on here.  Thanks.       \",\"Yes, I know it's nowhere near Christmas time, but I'm gonna loose Net access in a few days (maybe a week or 2 if I'm lucky), and wanted to post this for interested people to save 'till Xmas.   :-( Note: Bell Labs is a good place IF you have a PhD and a good boss, I have neither. --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Subject: Xmas light set with 2 levels of brightness  Another version of a variable brightness Xmas light set: This set starts with a 2 blinker 35 bulb string.

Only one blinker is used.  Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the string 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in parallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing and the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open, this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.   Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get one.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these draw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.  What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light  at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current  from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing  both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a  low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow  at reduced brightness. \",\" How can we resist a questions that says something like this?   If your Expose event handler is truly intelligent about exposed rectangle information, then you can use XClearArea to generate an Expose event (assuming that your background pixel is not None) for the enclosing rectangle of your new item.  This is still not great, since any other items contained within that rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn.  If your Expose event handler simply redraws everything, you'll be doing much more work than just drawing the new item \\\"on top\\\" of the existing scene. \",\"Regarding David Wilkerson's prophecies.  While I'm not real sure of his credibility, I do remember a book he wrote, called A VISION or something like that.  He made a prediction that people who bought gold would be hurt financially.  At the time, gold was up to about $800; now it is less than half that.  This prediction stuck in my mind because a lot of people where I worked were buying gold.  The problem is, we tend to remember predictions that come true and forget ones that didn't (a la Jean Dixon).

Daevid Bornhuetter-Machen, The Madison Edge  \\\"The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that  Hitler was original and showed initiative.\\\"  --Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show, ABC Radio Network,  October 27, 1992.  (NLNS)--Believe it or not, I was planning this comparative review of  Mein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant, The Way Things Ought to  Be before Sahl issued his comparative review. As usual, Sahl's was  independent and sharp as a scalpel.  My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At  least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the  idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for  delivery.  Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the  most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are  noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with  passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in  fact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost  identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German  election). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and  enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their  ideological quilt.  The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening  pages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the  German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway  line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923)  was \\\"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\\\" when  there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.  In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as  the Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost  succeeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic  claim in his introduction that \\\"in a school or during a commencement  ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\\\" Of  course, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of  God against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is  too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.  Of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books,  my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern  American Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version  of Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925),  and trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen  million followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book  after building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in  Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.  Thus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily  three-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary  propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way  Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a  translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the  printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since  radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of  luxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to  spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop  $22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.  But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some  cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of  their propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these  days.)  Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf  Hess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of  ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio  program's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk  show, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He  knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows  that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the  opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh  earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a  RICO indictment.  On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of  material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For  example:  On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society  Hitler: \\\"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who  individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly  perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in  order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of  imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight  for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of  thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\\\"  (page 577).  Limbaugh: \\\"Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The  show is devoted exclusively to what I think ...

After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that  haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened  Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed  Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s,  Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to  depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American  radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the  Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for  The Fascist States of America.  And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the  radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate.

Data files should be examined and repaired.   You're not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky stuff in a PC environment.   A reasonably accurate prediction...   Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files:  There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain, and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.  The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size, and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not important right now.  The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find the actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it holds a \\\"magic\\\" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad (unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file.  The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored. The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is doled out in \\\"chunks\\\" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster is 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.  To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster. Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file. Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump around and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a time, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker which says it's the last cluster in the file.  CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into submission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to double-check anything it \\\"fixes\\\".  Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:   All of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match the size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter the directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long. But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers, obviously, are made up.))   Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached to any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these \\\"lost chains\\\" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK through FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply be marked \\\"available\\\" in the FAT.    ...   These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously, one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that C:\\\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...  To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name. This will \\\"fix\\\" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces. Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to assemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  \\\"Missing pieces\\\" are likely to be found in those \\\"lost chains\\\" at the top...)   Your disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of the problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space...  In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT. There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the problem occurs.

For instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain blanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actually performed the action isn't the murderer (but I guess this is actually made clear in the below definition).   What do you mean by \\\"reasonable?\\\"  [...]  Yes, it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition.  But, even though the series is recursively infinite, I think the meaning can still be deduced.   [math lesson deleted]  Okay, let's look at this situation:  suppose there is a longstanding feud between two families which claim that the other committed some travesty in the distant past.  Each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family.  Now, let's suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you don't like dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, there is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty. How do you resolve this?  Well, they are all murders.  Now, I suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your \\\"problem,\\\" but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.  And, in any case, the nested \\\"murderer\\\" in the definition of murder cannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity. And, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition?  See, in a totally objective system where all the information is available, such a nested definition isn't really a problem.\",\"   I found the MS defrag looks very much like Norton Speedisk.

This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in.      Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the  peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway  documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals. The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office) was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and  has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a  lot to do with it.      It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications.  I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then \\\"maps\\\" the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can \\\"cd\\\" to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the  peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.     My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!

ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.        ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## #######################################################################               JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon  University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:  1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.   FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I actually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.  I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to invest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then I also passed my road test.  On May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a 4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb), I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late, skidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under a car and been killed.  Now this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff as I did.  So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until you're ready to use it.   While you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in DC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you save up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear, plus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure the machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up machine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration and licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.   I pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200 in Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be poor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo more expensive.   There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle magazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or recent models might be available.  You could probably look through past issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice instead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around and they were generally set up the way I wanted.  Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping, were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence cheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\",\"begin 644 outOfControl.gif M1TE&.#=AN@*6`?```````/___RP`````N@*6`0`\\\"_@Q@J)O-[XQ4#IYX::Z3 M9PUB4ZAY9`<NY59*:/!2L0C-J^W>2(>?[-C3Q70,6A`H9)&2OA=*ELQ)?RW+ MP3HT5F%1RQ%INGZNVMF4&WR0?4+>\\\"OO!,-7(-SO,K#^I=2_<=J?4,QB(`X-V MN)-X>+;C1^B&UI7C&#E)=7E&F)?9\\\"?9X`OEH.77CE(*I!5KI^08H-I8PMC9: M26HW\\\"RLFN]LK>@NH1PN[UT>YQ,&ETL#[)#=BVO0<ZZ=VB7S=**D)!?G+\\\\]M& M%`[<2MY]$=[*JFW8V>6ZYHSZG6V.#DVZ-XS?[8*X:`@M6;SB;5M'<\\\"\\\"U3VS& M-5E5J-JT8)P<%>&#$=I#_CH2O40*\\\")#=/6\\\\.3QW,(JY,IB,C4[6\\\\-Y(EPTW\\\" MRIP[*:AB'X>Z/\\\"K2MV5805T:/YD@28G&LIQ+AVY,6$%G\\\"@]4X]\\\"SVM2:THGS M;MIJ$9)1/W<AO'I]-S%F2S-!SU9URXFBW))7N[95E!'4W*':5+CZ*(/;W+'R M\\\\DK9Q-$HUH4/56*+.C5K6L<'$V-%*>HQQ\\\\O,P.+#:7>0RLJAS:+]LW:2Z:BC M8:KK.QAQW-2FK;+MR><?(Y-X<1:V,YEVQXB1;5\\\\&'E$.J]\\\\S>\\\\7;$!RSY7G2 MTGT]+%:WZW&B]=*%2U.U2(3>*<)[FRUT68-87I>_N_I:3DF2`\\\\/^UWLI1I^) M_L:?@]D18E6AIMQ1A2F6T&S-074@3R+(%$5V]ODCDGI(I71:=_&)UYHJL#4H M3(`U\\\",?67N?A@B!A$:18FQ$%O;C%;B>!4Z$OF!!(8BF**:21?@8.J(1++A5H MV&:118><=*PEEY^,$X)&6V;DL.B=@E)&.>1W[/&&TGL,;>FC<<:(R1]\\\\C9'G M!(.Y(1(-2,4YZ$]G5)H()7U!PHACBDQ5)I6<EH%YHD)P>,EDFF\\\"5XV&&U=G4 MD'KV:*C@HW0-Y^<V%FY7(G?[04E,F_;DV>\\\"??74*VF'7L4E=@N8IF1&5[&'S MVW%^018<8Q)-8YT5KQ[G!IAIK\\\"7A;KZ2Z%ELSUFZ_DI\\\\RI)W47@6+:@HA`DV M&DJ1ITK*:K,_X->K4=P\\\"I!M@-5Z:#YV>*IDH9$%N.I^DQ>F)WFS'+E83<GEA MB.I/)H4W)X>I601%I+PM9VZEPVXU+WA%FANP>U_86.>_CG(Y[KG<ZFO+*_RP MVJ^6'!-,%#6S=)D/O3:^:F#\\\"@9+\\\\W%\\\\W3A?AC,`@BF^U_\\\";9\\\\,+$+BMPGR]) MZS%S/&8YAXH2[ZP5Q#*&&Z.F8[);C,A0P3CUH&&HNZZJQ*#'Z9Z1Z@=KO7;A ME300BSP+8K`7GPTMM@9=60Z[)_+<6L^IPMGOCJ7B[0Q-SB)-,=<4^L9,6/\\\"M M'6*]I)(Y<7VQXIIR3R4G_FY-5B+#K)G-FMV-VLI>#UXLC0I/;F;!N08>](:- M2_=4EF.O&G3J3)YY,^H(&UOBAXP*FQUV`OJ5\\\"NQZUR65D24_[C6#I(L-XIVZ MQKLDN;1OF;OANB>)**>9.MPNDM,;&RVA>;]T\\\\-RN?U^TSH\\\";\\\\FU^K5[7Y/7* M_RF4<T[E$J;D(Y.)2\\\\AAW[N9`0GN;M#C%?^X%S5W:()M<(D=D1*X'N)`2WH_ M`A30;J>HZ55I>/!26<5^!9C:X2R$WQH5?[03+E,QC&I#XY,!*Z<4>RTI:?LS MTE7PQC\\\\8BDI(QZ!.0T0TL_B!2WRE:U%7E,&Z\\\"Y4F?'GP$/.26)+Y(5!>4FSB M_ODL`1W&?<U\\\"[0O(D5(\\\"CAGMBC3/RYE3=G*_,\\\\8J:_B;UCXHUR[@=7\\\"'-)RC M#SL&P5J@$%D1&YWG(\\\"B_[FD1:!MYS\\\\^&Y2X.;E%E'^M0``_904.A2FQFX-U/ M,$8?\\\\`UF5V#KT<MZY\\\"C@C<B*D&O$(Q>YA'LEXXJ)>1`F[V.W]!`1B4$13HZJ M()]9GL^`BJ2;EM#'LQ9N+D#54UN^=B@:9$7#<X1B(Z[X8;]FH**-SGGAY1K' MR#J6[UTMBV';.H2=^`&S#2SBG-%,IS/*G,9\\\\BD03BJ!&H$:R,S>3>@44L2G) M4NUM1(;@7>_DF3(*DJ$H]A-EYJ0YOQH&4!6G;,XH_L=&0_35R$RJ*6'&)CH^ MN0CH%+Q$&2Y?]QV!T/*>533=E,J7KEC:\\\\V`T8QRD9&G16S2O'ERLA6W$2$#C MI!(WB[G<-$TFJS)\\\"CHYJ<J,9=>J8>39R@9($H[_V=D&4EDT>VSLJDM3I1POB M,\\\"WH.)/;1C5%A&)0H/OJ#=MF]=5)BE.!TS'E$R-Z/VLJ1X;&\\\"X0$M[I!M![T MHX.DW=HNR30=-?,_BA/L^HPHCD+!+*4@S:A'+[78>HY%'04=Z3D7%A;$B?2R M3$7;*E=J2_WEL)IJS$5IU4C0,$5/:,W+GS2IJL&7LC6?:J-6'XE5NBQ\\\"2IX^ M@YL@'4E(DQ*S9YP]%\\\\[,_H%0ZU`P=W$B'&,X&,(*`==%YK,A'G\\\"37+[P,PZ6 M]&#?D!I'2OE,5B4][KB8ZT6#M<AE@K,2/<DZ3A,I-FJZ]*U7WQ))MDIUMMX% ME8;2:[3ZKBA?WC(N4/*81LMY\\\\F0)[531/`FDU2ZO2O-R[4K0])$]=I5BARV3 M+Q\\\\82T@6]S^'_&H_PI>I^!9ON\\\\YM4^\\\\\\\"8^!WP+BQ)HN;`.O3)6C&58Z\\\"RJWH M>-C1U':RL@<4$A$?BZ\\\\,?]\\\"=`AVF?0%*18FNIX`)317G5/?(`2X3N)Z@+'OM MMJ_H\\\"D].W-C64`E;U%/R-+PAFY8.9:PU03[%B>\\\"]B.8<FAD/[Y'`8$;N?.LK M_CN5\\\"@S*!*'Q\\\\;`HPFT:3)6\\\\Q>UF'4M\\\"$VKQ>2Z2])I=6E<W]SBUK\\\\4NV%2[ MK5,IH\\\\Z?BW.FLTS>SD$YR>R@V4E=-59AMFZ%O]T?)4&%.4?Z-UE$$R[+&%OJ M/SIYQ-?R78TQ&K.<&11B?0WH&C6MOQFV6<X&SFDU!!5);;+,KIBY\\\"0GA]V%W MP@/9EO5U8_!8R-6A6LF0OK.*VXMN$6ML14!4ZXM'O>-W:G4?U;PTCY?M;_SY M;\\\\':O;&#!WI1ZTE-JT,&\\\\JY_[4\\\"]I%>%A$FG*B4[V$D+[^(8?+C5\\\\%K=;$'V MT$4V]W(%/5,7JY\\\"/Q_`T3P`=\\\\#4CN-\\\\R[S&#+TTK_H0KK1TU].$T;_Q&N4&Q MOS4#EZ7X#%\\\\L$_:F%?-XK9J\\\\;>9Y>+Y)/T]2>EWRR$;=6EJC*>A\\\\$W-HAMU_ M-5]VOGGZVK-/.^PTKM_VR.C@M'>3:-I4L'@SMZBOAQ2(LV9X!6?>;NI*EI:.

Question is that the '91 TSi AWD was mentioned in the April Consumer Reports to a car to avoid!  In particular, the manual transmission, electrical system, and brakes were below par (in both models).  A friend of mine ownes a '90 TSi AWD and he has had 2 brake jobs (pads), one stuck valve, and some clutch/transmission problem, something about sticking/grinding into second gear.  This doesn't seem too bad if one \\\"beats\\\" on his car.  I am willing to suffer reliability--for speed and looks.  Seems you have to pay big buck if you want all three.  Anyway can anyone please let me know how you like your Talon, and any problems you may have had, and if the repairs are worth it.  Thanks for any responses!\",\" While I agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding, I disagree strongly with your original point. The point of formal training  must be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion to know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike  in a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular. Countersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among  new bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the  motorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the direction opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous. I have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she is to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the  motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right  handle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road.  A worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn the rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.  The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency  situations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) of countersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.\",\"I am testing IDEA block cipher implementations for correctness and needs some golden test vectors.

There are still a lot of languages without the Bible, or a part of the Bible. There are still many languages which we are not able to write, simply because the written version of the language has not yet been defined!  I guess this is one of the main goals for Wycliffe Bible Translators: To define rules and a grammar for writing the 'rest' of the languages of this world. I do not see that any of them will have any reason to become unemployed during the foreseeable future. (Provided they get their neccessary support!)

The bike has about 47,000 miles : and is around $4500. It has had two previous owners, both employees : of the dealership who, I have been told, took very good care of the : bike.  : I have two questions: 1) Is this too many miles for a bike? I know this : would not be many miles for a car but I am unfamiliar with the life : span of bikes. 2) Is this a decent price? I am also unfamilar with : prices for used bikes. Is there a blue book for bikes like there is : for cars?.  : Thanks for any advice you can give.  :                             --Mark --  Mark,    47k is not too many miles on a VFR750.  I sold my (well maintained) '87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition. All that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings and seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers to look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was mint.     As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800. There is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price. I've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all said low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.     A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain it at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my VFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot. Progressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.

Surely the whole point of all this madness is to make Joe Public think that his/her communications will be kept safe, while James Bond at the NSA can, if need be, have full, decrypted access to someone's communications?

As Daryl points out, Markus won't be joining the Pens for this year's  playoffs, since the World Championships starts April 18th.   But there is a good chance that Markus will join the Pens before next  season. MoDo, though, naturally wants to keep their superstars Forsberg  and Naslund, so the latest news on this is that MoDo is looking for  personal sponsors for Forsberg and Naslund in order to match the kind  of money they would receive in NHL.

It is Mats Sundin and  Calle Johansson that Curt hopes can join the team, although in a late  stage of the tournament.

Thanks, Jason\",\"  As a libertarian (with a small l) who voted for Clinton, I think that he should abolish the Selective Service and the draft.  If his conscience forbade him to go to war in Vietnam, it should forbid him to perpetuate this system of government-sanctioned slavery.   If our government would pay attention to SERIOUS domestic issues (the ECONOMY) and choose to stay out of other people's wars (Iraq, Bosnia, Somalia), we would not be in this fix.  An anyway, couldn't the jobs be replaced by improving our domestic situation?  (I'm not for continued deficit spending, but if Clinton and Congress want to spend, I'd rather they improve the  infrastructure than fight other people's wars.)   A novel idea:  Getting away from naval bases, what about refurbishing decommissioned Air Force bases as airports?  This would be SO much cheaper than building them from the ground up (Denver's new airport is one of the  most appalling examples of pork-barreling and cronyism I have seen in my lifetime).  Even if no more airports are needed, I'm sure Bill Gates or Ross Perot would LOVE to have their own private airfields, and the money from their purchases could be applied to the public debt. \",\" Actually detecting a BREAK is done by watching for a \\\"character\\\" containing all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt.

The probe was launched into this region for the earth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow down. The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without expending fuel, we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible\\\". The originator of the technique said that NASA wasn't interested, but that Japan was because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel for deceleration.

The problem in this case is at least as bad as that of trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary experience.  One can get some rough understanding, but the language is, from the perspective of ordinary phenomena, inconsistent, and from the perspective of what's being described, rather inexact (to be charitable).  An analogous situation (supposedly) obtains in metaphysics; the problem is that the \\\"better\\\" descriptive language is not available.

So, only the correct key(s) would reveal the presence of an \\\"illegal\\\" document.

Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started  with a solid single to right, moved to second on \\\"Bob\\\" Kelly's infield sneaker down the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a  rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.  Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only  given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double by Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after Joe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who  argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by \\\"drawing the line\\\" (really, he should know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting tossed.  The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must  have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's single, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell and turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson failed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:  Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly: Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended. (Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)  The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's ground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back singles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long fly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was hung out to dry killing the Reds rally.  Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game in late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended up walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a  week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went to Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings work, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit surprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.  The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory today.

No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.  I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I haven't seen IDE drives cheaper.  : The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card : (or PGA?) was $800.

No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read: easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.  : I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented : data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better : (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when : managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.  On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:  A (partial?) list:  1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them   concurrently.  2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac  and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice  with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)  3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For  instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor  212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will  work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the  termination, plug it in, and away it goes.  4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that  the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is  quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:  to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very  noticable, as many things can be going on at once.  One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card.    Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.

I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, just have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and   muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent  irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep,  wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the  spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot, and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 \\\" apart.)  This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.

What is important is HOW they are used, and what            else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )             (1) THE 7-DAY FAST.                 1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind            at a time, preferably grapes.                 2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half            raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape            clean the intestinal linings.                 3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice            you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune            juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from            concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to            your home bathroom.)                 4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and            dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS            CONTAIN LAETRILE.).                 5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from            two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and            add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).             Drink one glass per hour.           [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day            every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH            PULP.]                 6th day: Same as 5th day.                 7th day: Same as 6th day.                 All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each            day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements,            plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.             (2) THE GRAPE DIET.                 Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to            8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the            six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.                   (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.                Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple            cider \\\"flavored\\\" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a            glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.             Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a            week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal            healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially            effective against those types of cancer that resemble a            FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections.                     (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]                Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level            comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.             Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely            dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt            (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda.                 Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising            your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your            stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down,            chomping your teeth together, etc..                 Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes            the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the            book \\\"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\\\", by Frances Nixon, 1973.                 PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should            prepare it and drain it.           For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away            from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly            expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt            other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at            least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.             (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take            a 2-Billion-bacteria \\\"Acidophilus\\\" capsule, which is also an            EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \\\"A.I.D.S.\\\"            (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the            digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune            system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal            bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \\\"Lyme disease\\\".]           Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder            storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \\\"Major\\\" or            \\\"Minor Periods\\\" as listed in the \\\"Solunar Tables\\\" published            bimonthly in \\\"Field & Stream\\\" Magazine, (because of the            measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields            present at those times).           Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year.                    (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES:                         For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the                 affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons                 per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for                 about 2 months.                          D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to                 perform NORMAL cell functions.                  ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.                  To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.                  To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per                 day.                [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.                  IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer                 cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile                 into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is                 ALSO present in the digestive system.)]                  ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include                 Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most                 people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A                 (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide                 Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up                 to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-                toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime                 will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types),                 suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes,                 prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not                 cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST                 \\\"A.I.D.S.\\\", which is really a form of cancer similar to                 leukemia.]  (See the book \\\"Life Extension\\\", by Durk                 Pearson and Sandy Shaw.)                  HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3%                 hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably                 DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day,                 hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.                  Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers                 several times per day.                Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good                 daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants                 described above.                  VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and                 much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA                 doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources.                  Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell)                 NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on                 and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an                 aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-                radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with                 daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH                 magnetic fields.                  Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES                 can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well                 as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics                 Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos                 of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays!                  INTERFERON tablets.                 TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho).                             HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical                 problems (even drug addiction!).                  50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure                 prostate trouble.                  This list is NOT exhaustive.              The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-           DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent            and cure many other medical problems including heart-           diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work            effectively.             Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these            remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send            a strong message to one's subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it            to CURE the cancer.             In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer,            then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies            described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast),            BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations            and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer            treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!].

Instead, I wrote to Bentsen.  My letter was not exactly strongly-worded; I simply stated that the BATF approach was immoral (military-style assault, firing into a house where they knew there were kids).  Aparently, Bentsen forwarded my letter to the BATF and they responded to  me directly.  It follows the text of your reply pretty closely.  However, I intend to send another letter directly to them, in return.   This section is not in the letter that I received.  The parts about ATF logo and steenking badges or their loss of the element of surprise were not included, either.

They were acting in direct contradiction to scripture.  Jesus' Second Coming is something that everyone will know of.  Jesus also predicted that there will be false Messiahs who will use His name.  His prophecy has been fulfilled.   I agree with you there.    Me too.  I have already given my life to God.  If God tells me to lay down my life, it will be to save another life.    Do you judge all Christians by the acts of those who would call themselves Christian and yet are not?  The BD's contradicted scripture in their actions.  They were NOT Christian.  Simple as that.  Perhaps you have read too much into what the media has portrayed.  Ask any true-believing Christian and you will find that they will deny any association with the BD's.  Even the 7th Day Adventists have denied any further ties with this cult, which was what they were.  Do you judge all Muslims by the acts committed by Saddam Hussein, a  supposedly devout Muslim?  I don't.  Saddam is just a dictator using the religious beliefs of his people to further his own ends.

Maybe not precisely, but well enough to know if you should let him around before you try to pass.  I know what you are talking about, about the other driver being startled, because i myself have been startled by drivers cruising by at around 90-100mph when i'm doin 55-65.  The problem, though, as i saw it, was not their fault for barreling around me, but my fault for not paying the attention to my task-at-hand that i should have been. Oddly enough, since the 2nd time(happened 2x in around 4 mo. when i'd had my liscence for around 6 mo), i haven't been startled..and i've been passed by cars doing roughly twice the speed of my car.  Another odd occurance is the fact that this only seems to happen on LONG trips...and if i drive along with them, it doesn't happen at all :-) even on the long trips! :-)  (adrenaline will do that to you...i've had bad cop experiences with speeding, so anything over the limit is adrenalizing for me...scared i'll get caught :-)  Maybe they should raise the limit, so we can pay better attention.....  just curious, and my .otwo\",\"   Agreed.  --          \\\"Satan and the Angels do not have freewill.

Unless you have an accident, you won't need more.  If you plan on paying for the car with a credit card, check and see if your card automatically covers rental cars.  Also, your own auto insurance may cover rental cars also.  Most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent, and require you to initial in several spots if you don't want it.  The credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of coverage that the rental agency is trying to sell.  I have never rented from Alamo, so I don't know if they follow this same practice.  Yes.  It is a compact 2-door, probably a bit dull performance and acceleration-wise, but very adequate.

If they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and force compression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).  If you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend into,  then drag is reduced.

This person instead has posted one of the worst arguments I have ever seen made from the pro-Christian people.  I've known several Jesuits who would laugh in his face if he presented such an argument to them.  Let's ignore the fact that it's not a true trilemma for the moment (nice word Maddi, original or is it a real word?) and concentrate on the liar, lunatic part.  The argument claims that no one would follow a liar, let alone thousands of people.  Look at L. Ron Hubbard.  Now, he was probably not all there, but I think he was mostly a liar and a con-artist.  But look at how many thousands of people follow Dianetics and Scientology.  I think the  Baker's and Swaggert along with several other televangelists lie all the time, but look at the number of follower they have.  As for lunatics, the best example is Hitler.

(Around 5 MB.)  I have a Quadra 950.  I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.          (using block-mode transfers) I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can          achieve 6.8 MB/s.  Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.  It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer, then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)  So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer,   Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer. Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer. Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.         ... Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer. Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.  Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously, and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho') each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.  Why?  Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time.) Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use the same bus to mac RAM?  Is there anything I can do?\",\" I'm not sure about Juha, but another top center, Rauli Raitanen([ss{t) is drafted by Jets. Raitanen had very good year and he has played in the Finnish nationalteam.

Presumably only recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention. The necessity it refers to has always been there, but it's been implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of the new window.   [...]  This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a border-pixel, and the problem should go away.  There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.

Sigh.  Another naive illusion down the toilet....      ----- Tommy McGuire mcguire@cs.utexas.edu mcguire@austin.ibm.com\",\"I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of mite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years (since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained from painful experience:    1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.      Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more      sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.    2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear      that these things will itch for months.    3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of      it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,      since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could      find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special      collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is      required to get it.    4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old      folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall      reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers      burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I      think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some      sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.    5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.      A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally      applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is      another preparation called \\\"Chig Away\\\" that is a combination of      sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was      prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In      the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get      up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we      live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They      apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur      as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)    6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget      the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment      that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone      creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine      (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.      Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this      counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think      it gains nothing).    7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved      by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery      as well.  Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money.\",\"Heya all, I've got a pair of Oakley forsale  There are frogskins, with aurborn red.

Is it transmitted periodically in the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does the phone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever, or tries it to turn them into voice-output ? (Which would not be disturbing)    Second question: Why!?!? Why is such a strange procedure used, and not a real RNG ? This turns those S1,S2 in a kind of bottleneck for system- security.    So no (technical) provision will be taken to place a 'timeout' on these warrants? This would be a unique possibility to realize such a technical restriction, by letting the escrow-agencies perform the decoding of the session key. Just take modem-lines instead of secure fax.

It's a very biblical doctrine as Romans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church has always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free will.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also affected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and Jansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4).  For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect, who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those without that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need it, as they had freely chosen hell.          ^^^^^^^^^^^ People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own effort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined them to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were deserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.   Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little), for those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And those He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one or in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal punishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it (cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder were forgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I need not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is quite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from the Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira, Jerusalem in 70 AD, etc.  not a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we not >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more  We should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the U.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an isolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in the case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved, it would not be a \\\"just war.\\\"  \\\"Blessed\\\" after all, \\\"are the peacemakers\\\" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Our actions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us.\",\" I haven't seen any speculation about it. But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau)  was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost payload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from 2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competing with the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except now I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the  successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the early results are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in  Russia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue  their development.   The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton  is 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-D which sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know about launch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which are probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake things up pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragile thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now. Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know  how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track and erected on the pad?    They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads  (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the US at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are political problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention. \",\"I went to Staples in Framingham, MA, today, and grabbed the info-sheet on the 450 bundle.

About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes  under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement  of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of  the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced  the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor   suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.   While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being   manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently  increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (  palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part  the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had  been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the  pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is   persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3  and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides  minor reductions in pain and is only short term.     My questions are:        Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the      levels of pain?       Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?       Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?     Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.         Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.

I spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently,  by coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that  while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the  Church as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church  recoginizes itself as a community of believers, members of the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable to each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island, there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without the priest being present, but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area.     I remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus, married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the community.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with one another--the community should be able to rely on that  couple to be as one.   While couples may marry without witnesses, they  may NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An  anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage at all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half-hour later!!   I tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage, but I would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they intended to be married, assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a commitment, I believe, in God's eyes.   But I'm digressing....     God be with you,\",\"Okay, let's suppose that the NSA/NIST/Mykotronix Registered Key system becomes standard and I'm able to buy such a system from my local radio shack. Every phone comes with a built in chip and the government has the key to every phone call.  I go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key.   What's to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or  buying a used phone at a garage sale? Whooa. The secret registered keys just became unsynchronized. When the government comes  to listen in, they only receive gobbledly-gook because the  secret key registered under my name isn't the right one.   That leads me to conjecture that:  1) The system isn't that secure. There are just two master keys that work for all the phones in the country. The part about registering your keys is just bogus.   or   2) The system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks like this.

I thought you were gonna buy a BMW for its superior power and handling... \",\" Kratz comments above show otherwise.   Bingo - now the question is, does the Glock's qualify?  Let's see the evidence that Kratz uses.   But first an aside.  Having an air gun proves nothing.  Moreover, my comments are based on what Kratz writes.  He's free to argue that he babbles in text but actually knows something off-line.   Harder than what?  I note that almost all revolvers work the same way, so it can't be \\\"harder than revolvers\\\".   Sure they can.  (Moreover, we know now that Kratz' sample is unrepresentative.)  We can look at the reasoning.  It is basically \\\"these Glocks are dangerous because they're not like my 1911/S&W third generation.\\\"  Part of that is true, but since those same people don't claim that revolvers, which share the relevant property, are dangerous, we see that the argument fails.   Why would I care?  I'm not looking for more bogus reasoning.   One can make hundreds of simple statements without having anyone \\\"getting right on your ass\\\".

The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be depressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just about (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working correctly is totally drop safe.  Now, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single documented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because he failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely prevented the office from getting shot.  The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire. This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down intentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a 'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else. By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece. From the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of firing it.  The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be familiar with that particular type of firearm.\",\" Does this organization have an official e-mail address these days?

Let's check Mr. Cain's facts a bit, shall we?    FACT:  It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license to do so from PKP, whether or not one is charging for it.  Furthermore, any use of RSA, other than for research purposes allowed under US patent law, is similarly unlawful.  Therefore, the \\\"average citizen\\\" cannot use RSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP.  There is no licensed, freely available product in the US that uses RSA encryption other than RSAREF (and hence RIPEM), at least as far as I am aware.  If you know of another, please post it here.   FACT:  The last contact I had with RSA Data Security, Inc was with some guy trying to sell me a license (unsolicited, I might add) for TIPEM. Cost: $15K plus 2-5 percent royalties.  I suppose it is a matter of opinion as to whether or not these terms count as \\\"mucho bucks\\\" or \\\"incredibly reasonable.\\\"  Either way, however, this definitely falls into the \\\"routines *they* tell you to (use)\\\".   FACT:  There are no restrictions (yet!) on the use of cryptography under US law, although this is beginning to look like it will change.  The only impediments to widespread use of RSA cryptography in the US are PKP's patents.

When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this       menu you can press any function key except F5. If you move or copy       files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like       'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory. +       The header line in 'read' menu includes \\\"(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)\\\". +         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.       pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use         for reading current file.       pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This         program will automatically determine which format this file is.         The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check         standard extension. Still fail, report error.       pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.         If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key           (except ESCAPE).         If any error occurs, program will make a beep.         ESCAPE to terminate.       pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.       pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.     2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.       Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.       pressing RETURN: show image.         in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text         mode.       pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do         special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.       pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.       pressing SPACE: save current image to file.

This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image         to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program         will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another         directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after         pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change         directory to what you want. Then,          pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.         pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename                       (filename under bar).     3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.    4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,      the performance is poor.    5. If you want to save 8 bits image :        try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...       If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):        try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster        (No one is better for true 24bits image)    6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.    7. Not all subroutines are fully tested    8. This document is not well written.

I am trying to set up a Conner 3184 and a Quantum 80AT drive.  I have the conner set to the master, and the quantum set to the slave (doesn't work the other way around).  I am able to access both drives if I boot from a  floppy, but the drives will not boot themselves.  I am running MSDOS 6, and have the Conner partitioned as Primary Dos, and is formatted with system files.  I have tried all different types of setups, and even changed IDE controller cards.  If I boot from a floppy, everything works great (except the booting part :)).  The system doesn't report an error message or anything, just hangs there.

In April  1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A  number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian Paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku. Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the creation of an Armenian SS formation in order   \\\"to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the   spirit of the Nazi ideas.\\\"  He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]  [1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106. [2] Enno Meyer, A. J. Berkian, 'Zwischen Rhein und Arax, 900     Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen,' (Heinz Holzberg     Verlag-Oldenburg 1988), pp. 124 and 129.   The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any  official position. His views were represented by his men in the respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942. Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after a long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1]   A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not 'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy. As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August  1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.  [1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., pp. 112-113.  Need I go on?

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the system key   2) Recieve Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number      is necessary for local operation).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large, making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.  IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number.\",\"I am very interested in investigations of starvation for improving health.

He viewed himself as a resourceful man, and (IMO) decided to check out gracefully if he couldn't support himself.

On the non-pacifist side:]  (1) Killing to defend the innocent may be, if anything, _more_ justifiable than killing in self-defense.  I can turn my _own_ other cheek, but I have no right to turn someone else's.  (2) It seems to me that if Jesus had meant to teach pacifism, He would have made His position more explicit.  He didn't tell the centurion to leave the army, for instance; and the NT is full of military metaphors.  [B. On the pacifist side:]  (1) Apparently many early Christians refused to fight in the Roman army, or stated that one should refuse if given a choice.  But it's not clear whether they were objecting to war _per se_, or objecting to Roman policies.  (2) In modern warfare, it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only at combatants.  Bombing, both conventional and nuclear, kills lots of civilians.  (3) It's hard to tell whether any _particular_ war is justified at the time.

There is no planet inside of the orbit of Mercury.  The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to Newtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations and calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system of equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was afoot with Mercury.  But alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915 and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian  geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of it's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession of Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb's numbers rather than Leverrier's.)  Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequent efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar have been fruitless.  -Bill Gawne   \\\"Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe   are the laws of the universe.\\\"                       - G.

The Roman Empire lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The main reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by the men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city of Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of Mazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter of time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto the rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle should be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of Constantinople only hastened the inevitable along.

Note the early use of PostScript technology, predating many of this year's papers listed in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.  -- Eric   Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),  by Dave Baraff, Tom Duff   From: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu  Newsgroups: comp.graphics  Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem  Organization: Program of Computer Graphics   I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.  First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.  Now, the phrasing of this question says \\\"if a line intersects a polygon\\\", so this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.  In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript.  (See \\\"PostScript Language\\\", by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).  So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P, and then \\\"outputs\\\" the answer.  By \\\"output\\\", we mean the program executes a command called \\\"showpage\\\", which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original problem.  There are two small problems with this approach.    (1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the  reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of  Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of  Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.   (2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the  PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in  other words, will it halt?   Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a  Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is  undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn  out to be undecidable.   I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite precision and running out of ink, paper or both.  A couple of references might be:  1. Principia Mathematica.  Newton, I.

Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill NJ  The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know better, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc. 37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)  --------  From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)  Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative.  (I think there's an '89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that deals with this).  --\",\"  Well, if you're going to get upset with this, you might as well direct some of this moral outrage towards Glavcosmos as well.  They pioneered this capitalist application of booster adverts long before NASA. (Sign of the times: a Sony logo on a Soyuz launcher...)   This sounds like something Lowell Wood would think of.  Does anyone know if he's involved?   This may be the purpose for the University of Colorado people.  My guess is that the purpose for the Livermore people is to learn how to build large, inflatable space structures.   If this is true, I think it's a great idea.  Learning how to build to build structures in space in an essential step towards space development, and given that Freedom appears to be shrinking towards the vanishing point, I question whether NASA's space station is going to provide much, if any, knowledge in this area. (Especially if a design such as Faget's wingless orbiter is chosen...) If such a project also monitors ozone depletion and demonstrates creative use of (partial) private sector funding in the process -- so much the better.   And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the \\\"wild idea\\\" stage or does it have real funding?   Not yet.

A technician examined it and  pronounced the disk drive unusable.  My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides). When CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.  I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.

Hamas figures significantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israel deported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to Hamas's kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer version appears in the May issue of Harper's Magazine, which obtained and translated the tape.)        My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished high school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work for Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I'm married and I have two daughters.      The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine explicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is Palestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli] Security Services.      Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation, cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose the methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into collaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally, we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.      We don't execute every collaborator. After all, about 70 percent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into their misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is based on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many collaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli Border Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once. He's as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an Israeli soldier.      There's another group of collaborators who perform an even more loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become collaborators. I regard the \\\"isqat\\\" [the process by which a Palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious duty to execute him.      A third group of collaborators is responsible for the distribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the Security Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the drugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.      In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of uncovering collaborators, We can't afford to abduct an innocent person, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished forever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any doubt, then he is executed.      In many cases, we don't have to make our evidence against collaborators public, because everyone knows that they're guilty. But when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is a collaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for evidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be irrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually obtained in the form of a confession.      At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell him that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the last moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the information we need.      We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has been a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them confess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply pressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts confess as well.      Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an interrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working for the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself confessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the information to us. In addition, three members of his network of collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this much evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are very careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our principal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he himself confesses his crimes.       A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be executed without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of names, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not mark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for execution.      When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can't shoot him -- to do so might give away our locations. That's why collaborators are strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, \\\"What do you think? How should we execute you?\\\" One collaborator told us, \\\"Strangle me.\\\" He hated the sight of blood. \",\"  I didn't mean to offend or anything, I'm just quoting Stanky himself on the subject.

To which Stanky replied, \\\"I'm Polish, not Jewish.\\\"  So maybe that wasn't the most PC thing for Stanky to say, and maybe I was a little naive when I posted it.

These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible    courses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary    styles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further    reading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT    introduction...  Two other Intros to consider:  The \\\"Introduction\\\" by Ku:mmel is a translation of a strandard NT text. The references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense, but the book contains a wealth of information.  Perrin and Duling's Intro is also very good.  It's somewhat more modern than Ku:mmel's but not quite so densely packed.  Also the authors tend to go through the books of the NT in the historical order of composition; this gives a very useful perspective on the development of the NT.     ... There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  ... Probably the    best recommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.  A slight dissent: I think the Harper's is \\\"OK\\\" but not great.  One particular problem I have is that it tends to be pretty skimpy on bibliographic material.  My feeling is that it is OK for quick look-ups, but not real useful for study in depth (e.g. I keep a copy in my office at work).     ... (I think there may be a couple of books with this title...

It does not go into great detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in general, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM. It is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It is posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining specifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.  CRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS ---------------------  - Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,   in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign   messages with your private key.    RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard   cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with   RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a   huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.  - Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,   since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow   an attacker to claim to be you.    DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be   compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies   have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each   message has a different DES key, the work for each message would   remain high.  KEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS ----------------------  - Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking   RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived   from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy   of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network   packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.    The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the   private key file across an untrusted link.  So don't do that.  Run    RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of   you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)   which nobody else has physical access to.  - Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could    allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him   rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your   intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with   the other bogus public key and pass them along.    It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.   The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent   has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be    given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key   authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is   not always practical.  Having other people \\\"vouch for you\\\" by   signing a statement containing your key is possible, although    RIPEM doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as   PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys   in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for   authentication.  PLAYBACK ATTACKS ----------------  - Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could   still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message   with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)   to Alice which says \\\"OK, let's do that.\\\" Your opponent intercepts   it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is   authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may   interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent   could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,   figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the   opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register    your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient   will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the   unknown message.    To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should    include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique   identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM   should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be   sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within   the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that   the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be   automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at   automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated   headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in   the utils directory.  LOCAL ATTACKS -------------  - Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of   the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under   UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,   although it would take some planning and effort to do something like   replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of   the plaintext, depending how it's stored.    In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is   an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine   which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an   eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your   passphrase.)    RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In   the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine,   which you have total control over and which nobody else has access   to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of   viruses, and so on.  However, there's a very real trade-off between   convenience and security here.    A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation   where other people have access (even root access), but increase   security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of   course) executable on a floppy disk.    Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing   in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their   own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the   security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since   you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you've just   given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and   install traps in your account to steal your private key next time   you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the   situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of   cleartext password authentication.    I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my   security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that   potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are   in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not   carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated   with greater care for critical correspondence.  UNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS -------------------------  - RIPEM's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key   corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the   traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she   may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There    exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an   ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by   you and readable by anyone, although RIPEM does not provide this   functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically   states that such transformations should be possible to allow   forwarding functions to work.\",\"Hi!  I think VGA-Copy can do what you need.

Everyone,  Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess my question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:  The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere.  This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used. The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold internationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!! How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?  I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear) is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not analytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things complicated. Please give me a hint.  I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not. However, so many people involved in the problem \\\"sphere from 4 poits\\\". Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?

What's entropy?   * In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?    A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a   decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of   functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of   ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the   decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that   D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption   of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key   (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext   into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to   encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.  * What is an attack?    In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method   of starting with some information about plaintexts and their   corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out   more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state   mathematically what this means. Here we go.    Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,   and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.    An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an   algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that   there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have   f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this   probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).    The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at   least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and   g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible   ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other   words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions   E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).    An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if   n = 2, and so on.  * What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?    In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.   Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this   property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem   is strong!''    In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely   formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is   strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against   all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as   defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this   statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist   any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement   to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that   the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.    Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical   definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions   we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can   figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used   properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.    The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst   can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to   construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,   and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.    * Why is the one-time pad secure?    By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the   plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)   of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive   or) of K and P.    It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial   single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform   distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform   distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,   i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,   with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and   g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of   K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also   be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is   uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p   that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus   a fortiori A is trivial.)    On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used   for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial   multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be   thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';   this explains the name ``one-time pad.''  * What's a ciphertext-only attack?    In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is   constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about   n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some   information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial   if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given   G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.    For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can   easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply   guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use   the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no   matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which   produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.   If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is   a nontrivial attack.  * What's a known-plaintext attack?    The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,   G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.   In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption   P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the   other decryption P_2.    Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature   as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the   cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him   decrypt further messages.  * What's a chosen-plaintext attack?    A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical   series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the   cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into   our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a   chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and   look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured   out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of   attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''    A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption   attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a   way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.    There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:   for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as   T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew   for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash   function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.  * In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?    Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some   plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're   also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find   K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).    If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed   on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results   only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial   attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many   possible keys.  * What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?    Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys   randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to   for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which   are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English   words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much   faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.\",\" So what's your point?  Mark's comment still is valid.  To suggest that AIDS is \\\"deserved\\\" IS ludicrous.  I sin.  I can resolve to abstain from  sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail. I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided  the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation. If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.  To willingly judge \\\"others\\\" as deserving punishment seems to me to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.      So what's the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in \\\"deviant\\\" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS of deviant sexual behavior with HIV+ people and never be infected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors, many of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors carry the risk of transmission.      The end of all things is to know, love and serve God, growing daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  Even so I could get AIDS.  Anyone could, unless they remain forever celibate, IV-drug-free, and transfusion free.  Larry Overacker (llo@shell.com) -- \",\"    Just a quick question. If Mary was Immaculately concieved, so she    could be a pure vessel, does this mean that she was without sin    and, therefore, the perfect (meaning sinless) female human being?    Is this why she is held so highly in the Catholic Church despite    it's basically patriarchical structure?  She was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to Original Sin, but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life.  This was possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God.  She is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to God, and everything that flows from that relationship.  The Catholic Church sees her as the new Eve.

I agree that we'll probably never agree, and I'm starting to feel  frustrated, and I'm tired of having my conversations with my husband  dominated by this topic (just kidding, :-)).  I do have to say, though, that participating in this discussion has been a good learning experience for me.  My views on this topic have evolved and clarified through this, and I suspect that we may not disagree as  much as we think.   I admit that I'm strongly prejudiced against evangelical Christianity, and I may not always be rational in my reactions to it.  I grew up in EC, and went to an EC college.  It was definitely the wrong place for me, and I react strongly to any implication that EC or conservative Christianity has any sort of stronghold on true Christianity.  I shudder  when I remember the condescending attitude I had about other Christians  who didn't adhere to the EC model.  I have come to see that my real objection to this whole notion of  absolute truth is the actions I have seen it lead to.  I have had some  very bad experiences with evangelical Christians claiming to know the  truth, and judging me or others based on their belief that they have  the answers.  Knowing the truth doesn't seem to leave a whole lot of  room for others' opinions.  I can accept your belief in absolute truth as long as you* don't try to  use that belief to try to force others to comply with it, and you are  very careful that you don't hurt others with it.  Love your neighbor  seems to go totally out the window when one knows the truth and believes  that everyone should be living by that truth.  Other people have  convictions about the truth every bit as strong and sincere as yours,  based on careful searching, prayer, and their relationship with God.   Don't dismiss them because God didn't lead them to the same conclusions  as yours.  *This is not directed personally at you, Dean.\",\"In revision of history <9304131827@zuma.UUCP> as posted by Turkish Government Agents under the guise of sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic) LIE in response to article <1993Apr13.033213.4148@urartu.sdpa.org> hla@urartu.sdpa.org and scribed:   [(*]    Orhan Gunduz is blown up.

Side question:  how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with a replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles, after say 100/200/300K actual miles.

Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.  Right now, there are mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources (for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before uranium reached $200/lb.  \\\"Demand and supply balance will collapse\\\" is nonsense.  Supply and demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century? Not bloody likely.  New nuclear reactors are not being built at a sufficient rate.  Uranium from seawater is interesting, but it's a long term project, or a project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of self-sufficiency.\",\" I don't think they're paying for it.   Useful?

According to Demirok, Greek Cypriot administration not only  gives shelter to PKK guerillas but also supplies them with  food and weapons at the temporary camps set up in its territory.  Demirok disclosed that PKK has three safe houses in South Cyprus,  used by terrorists such as Ferhat. In the camps, he added,  terrorists were trained to use various weapons including RPG's  and anti-aircraft guns which had been purchased directly from  the Greek government. Greek Cypriot government has gone to the  extent of issuing special identification cards to PKK members so  that they can travel from one region to another without being  confronted by legal obstacles. Demirok's account was confirmed  by another PKK defector, Fatih Tan, who gave himself over to  police in Hakkari after spending four years with PKK. Tan explained that the terrorists went through a training in camps in South Cyprus,  sometimes for a period of 12 weeks or more.           \\\"Torture in Greece: Hidden Reality\\\"  Case 1: Kostas Andreadis and Dimitris Voglis.  ...Andreadis' head was covered with a hood and he was tortured by falanga (beating on the soles of the feet), electric shocks, and was threatened with being thrown out of the window.

The Israeli  secret service,        Mossad,  is   reported  to  have   acquired  significant        information in connection  with the camps set  up in the        Troodos  mountains   in  Cyprus  for  the   training  of        militants of the PKK and ASALA {Armenian Secret Army for        the Liberation  of Armenia}. According to  sources close        to Mossad, about 700 Kurdish, Greek Cypriot and Armenian        militants  are   undergoing  training  in   the  Troodos        mountains in  southern Cyprus.  The same  sources stated        that Abu  Nidal's special  advisers are  giving military        training to  the PKK and  ASALA militants in  the camps.        They added that the  militants leave southern Cyprus for        Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Greece  and Iran after completing        their training.  Mossad has established that  due to the        clashes  which were  taking  place  among the  terrorist        groups based  in Syria, the PKK  and ASALA organisations        moved to  the Greek Cypriot  part of Cyprus,  where they        would  be  more  comfortable. They  also  transferred  a        number of  their camps in  northern Syria to the Troodos        mountains.         Mossad  revealed that  the  Armenian National  Movement,        which is known as the MNA, has opened liaison offices in        Nicosia, Athens and  Tripoli in order to  meet the needs        of the  camps. The offices are used to provide  material        support for the  Armenian  camps. Meanwhile, the  leader        of the  Popular Front for  the Liberation of  Palestine,        George  Habash, is  reported  to  have ordered  his  men        not  to   participate  in  the  operations  carried  out        by  the  PKK &  ASALA, which  he  described  as \\\"extreme        racist,  extreme  nationalist  and   fascist.\\\"  Reliable        sources have said that  Habash believed that  the recent        operations carried  out by the PKK  militants  show that        organisation  to  be a  band  of  irregulars  engaged in        extreme  nationalist  operations.  They  added  that  he        instructed  his militants  to sever their links with the        PKK  and avoid clashing with it. It has been established        that George Habash  expelled ASALA  militants  from  his        camp  after ASALA's  connections  with  drug trafficking        were exposed.

It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal civlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967 without civil and political rights.

All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians are concerned and as far as common sense has it.   It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens and the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.  Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel is entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be entitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel to enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.  To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a crime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss  to which Israeli society has degraded.   I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return and live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ? Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their religion or ethnic origin ?

If you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent.  However, if a professional thief wants your vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:  1) ignition kill or fuel cut-off 2) a flashing red LED  These two are basic to a decent alarm system.   To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock. That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target. But, then there's always car-jacking.   Why is life so confusing?

Note that the film industry in California traded their political support for an \\\"assault weapon\\\" ban in the state for an amendment to the bill exempting the entertainment industry from that very ban.  Note that the very issue of the Batman comic book (\\\"Seduction of the Gun\\\") that was produced as a tool for gun-control organizations carries a back- page ad for a \\\"Terminator II\\\" video game extolling the numerous and varied sophisticated weapons available to the player.  Note that Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of the NY Times -- one of the oldest and most incessant gun-control grinders -- himself carries a concealed handgun.

Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That means third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consulting a 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at  21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks. Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are wrong.  By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as California, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally  stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law,  but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors, willing to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was terribly upset about this.  I remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a clinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wondering a bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice doesn't have a grain of truth to it.\",\"From another space forum     When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56  solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers  lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB.  The tool survived  the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot  altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.      NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,      \\\"It's been a long time since something like this happened.  We've  lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this.\\\"      The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a  Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on  April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the  report and Discovery was launched with its \\\"extra payload\\\".  NASA  officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th  launch date.      The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB  technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster,  its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a  part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.      A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that  the Shuttle processor will take \\\"appropriate action\\\".  Thiokol is a  subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch.  _________________________________________________________  Karl Anderson  DEV/2000: Configuration Management/Version Control  Dept 53K/006-2  Rochester, Minnesota 55901 253-8044  Tie 8-453-8044 INTERNET: karl@vnet.ibm.com PRODIGY: CMMG96A\",\" Hi...

H. Welbon)]         For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?   There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses word \\\"on faith\\\", we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now. If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods?   The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing, rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?   I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found.\",\"    Just curious, Roger, but since you have such a vast knowledge of the game and the league, how come you haven't made a living out of it?

I will for the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes that the bible is God's word to mankind?  I suspect that what happened to him is what he'll call being \\\"born again\\\"?  Anyway, was that recent? If the answer is \\\"yes\\\" to all the questions above, it is quite understandable.  However, IMO, I'ld rather give advice to your friend! I think I've been through something similar to him, and one thing I can say is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to communicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things is because they are now \\\"obvious\\\" to him.  What is \\\"obvious\\\" to him is not obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because from his point of view, he has been on \\\"both sides of the fence\\\".  This I mean that before he turned \\\"fundamentalist\\\", you two are agreeable because both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if a new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the discovery of let's say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, he's got to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than where he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now. You have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to you, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that risk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand and listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because he is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about, however, he may not realise that he's really putting you off.  [...]   So far, I've only been trying to explain things from his side.  However, I do understand how you feel too, because I wasn't a Christian for a good part of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or \\\"fundamentalists\\\" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their faith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately, \\\"religious belief\\\" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism is also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is inevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise), it will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both sides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can do your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he's trying to convince you about, that it's beyond you or not your concern \\\"for now\\\".  Don't tell him it's nonsense, because to him it is reality - and that would be a real insult.  He'll also have to be careful not to insult where you stand too.  Like I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too. I'll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a Christian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little differently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited and just blabbered away about what I've found!  To me, it was too good not to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn't really care most of the time what they thought.  You will probably think he's crazy too - but God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in mind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real to him, he doesn't see why God can't be real to you too.  I don't know how helpful this is to you.  But all the best anyhow - this is quite a challenge for you to face.  By the way, personal conviction: nobody is \\\"beyond saving\\\" except the one we call the  devil and his hosts.\",\"We are getting a memory fault and a core dump whenever we end a Motif session under Ultrix 4.3, running on a DEC 5000/240.

It is not necessary to celebrate a pagan goddess in the process.  Paul answered your question in Romans 9.  In v. 4 he stated that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the promises were given to the Israelites.  It is a package deal.  He goes on to identify those who are true Israelites.  Vs 6-8 makes it plain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way but those who accept the promise of God.  Paul continued to emphasize that he was an Israelite in 2 Cor. 11:22, then in Gal 3:29 he says that all those who belong to Christ are Abraham's seed, and heirs to all the promises given to the Israelites.  The promises come with the law.  It is all or nothing.  Why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law?  Certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you.
