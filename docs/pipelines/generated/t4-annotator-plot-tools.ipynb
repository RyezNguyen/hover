A single chip micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only costs about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell, use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want to try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut you a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.  If you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of  maybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than  you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add a power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count screams up to 9.  PD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros.  This application is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the  programmer's guide and create the binary with a hex editor.  John\",\"Does one exist, who makes it, and how much?

The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season.  Roster move:  Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill  Injuries:  Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes  Dominic Roussel  Game Summary:  I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts I didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by a few things I did pick up:  First Period:  Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51  Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp) Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda, Har (interference) 18:43  Second Period:  Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00  Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09  Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38 Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski, Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50  Third Period:  Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)  Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11  Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38 Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30  Overtime:  Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15. Penalties - None  Power Play:  Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4  Goalies:  Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)  Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)  On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off.  The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.  The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie.  On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner, Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play.  That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored, much less how.  From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy  Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark. But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????  What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...  #1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey next season.  #2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour, and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.  #3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season. Not a tough choice.  Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.  Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman in years to come.  Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome, he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year.  Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total. But consistency became a problem for him.

If you're interested, you can send him mail at:  att!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK  The FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning percentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in Patrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as many goals as they allowed, 319.  The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.  I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey News that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have no other way of getting them.

Maybe they're just UNLUCKY.  If a rapist pulls a woman into an alley in Boston, chances are almost certain that she won't be counted  as one of those self-defenders because our local constabulary didn't consider it important that she be allowed to arm herself.  Even though the shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the \\\"gun owner\\\" column.   Ironic words for somebody who lives in Florida.  The \\\"average threat level\\\" in Florida has been REDUCED by a liberal CCW policy.  It's well known that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because  they are less likely to be carrying than your natives.  Come on up to Boston, or NYC, or Washington DC, and see how much diddlysquat the  \\\"average threat level in the country\\\" means to a resident there.   Sometimes this works.  Sometimes it just lands your good neighbors  on the dance card for the next wave of drive-bys.  Someone here once told a story about LA gangs moving into Phoenix.  I've misplaced the original text, but the story started with one resident calling the  cops on a gang member.  Sure enough, a few nights later, there was a  drive-by performed at the resident's house.  Except that this time, unlike in LA, the entire street came out and returned fire, putting an end to the car's occupants.  The gang packed up and left.  Of course, in LA, or in a place like Florida after the hurricane, your first problem is to FIND an officer to step up to and tell anything.   Look, nobody is arguing this.  I have a fire extinguisher at home.   That doesn't mean I can be careless about tossing my burnt matches  on the carpet.  I live carefully, monitor the woodstove, get my flue cleaned twice a year, and test my smoke alarms annually.  But if -- DESPITE all this -- a fire does start, it's too late for any of these things EXCEPT the extinguisher.   You seem to be agreeing with your opponent.  You can't trust your government to protect you from abusers and violators -- white-collar, blue-collar, epauletted, or tank-shirted.  Ultimately, no one has the power to enforce your \\\"rights\\\" but you.  Unless you've given up that  power.   Too many people fit that category, that is true.  Some of us like to believe that they are uninterested in the facts behind the case for gun  ownership because they've been conditioned to believe that there AREN'T  any.  You seem content to underestimate the electorate; I'm willing to try to raise their consciousness.   I think we can.  HCI was founded in what, 1980?  In the mid-80's, they ran a \\\"One  Million Strong!\\\" campaign for two years before reaching this goal.   My understanding is that they \\\"reached\\\" it by the stratagem of including wide classes of people other than dues-paying members.  (I can't speak authoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they started running a \\\"Two Million Strong!\\\" campaign for a while -- but they let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they simply were never going to reach that level of membership.  In 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting point of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.   By 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had  about a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it the third largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA). And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historical figures from Kukla's \\\"Gun Control,\\\" pp. 61 and 420.)  As you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused by their T-bones and MTV.  That leaves hard-core gun-owners against  hard-core gun banners.  I know a number of ex-HCI members who have recently become NRA members. I've never heard of a single one who has gone the other way.  Yes, I think we can and will win this one.   I think they would be used far less to hammer nails, as well, but, like you, I can't give any citation showing that this utilization is CURRENTLY significant at more than an anecdotal level.

And yes, if they pierced you with the needles you probably should have protested.   euclid  \",\"     Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.    Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be, and isn't.     I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement.   First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ  could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the  male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.   Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.   Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option.   I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\",\"Note that if you get the external CD300 for your Centris or Q800 you will miss out on the sound mixing feature unless you are willing to run a wire from the motherboard sound input connector to the stereo output on the CD.

It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists  conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques.        Intuitive Graphic Interface   Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and  point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast.  This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image  layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.        Image Format Compatibility   Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.        Image Analysis & Processing   For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution  product or principal component analyses. An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions.        Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis   Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.). The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation, and 3-D image projection.        Easy External Program Interfacing   Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions.        Quick Quality Presentation   Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images, graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as  histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers.  Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external  graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?        Software Support & Development    Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)  of the Universite de Lille, France. The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features on-line help, is supported by an Internet address   sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and  version updates provided without delay.        Performance Tested    CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data  collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today, the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center and is widely used in many French laboratories, including the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure , Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire  de Meteorologie Dynamique.      A TEST VERSION OF SPHINX IS AVAILABLE AT loasil.citilille.fr    (134.206.50.4) anonymous (bin : cd SPHINX : get ALL_SPHINX.tar.Z)     IN THE TEST VERSION THE OUTPUT FILES ARE DISABLE.

It fails for several reasons :  1) You have edited out the context of the action under discussion.  2) I never brought the legal definition up. I use the English language and not the legal dialect. The legal definition of fraud changes from one country to another in any case. The context of the discussion is morality of censorship.     You are extrapolating from the statement I made concerning a circumstance in which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the Teel case. If you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you thought me you would have done rather better. The mode of argument I was using was a form of rhetoric. Argument by example, I describe a wide set of circumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they do not apply, thus the action is not permisable.  Obviously a company posting from a University adress would be squashed,  it would be contrary to the internet comercial use.   Now you are clutching at straws. In the context of the discussion it was the fact of association between the company and the post that was important. The typeface etc is inconsequential.    If you are implying that I am lying I suggest you read Mark Holohan and Ulick Staffords posts into soc.culture.british. If you are suggesting that  advocating murder is a trivial matter I would prefer that you state it directly.   Certainly I oppose the right of Dr Sidiqui and the Ayatolah Khomenhi to call for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Incitement to murder is not part of what I consider legitimate freedom of speech.    That is irrelevant, the case is not the incremental cost but the facility cost. If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe to USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the company. It is quite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and regulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy. For example if a Microsoft employee were to post \\\"Windows NT is crap don't buy it\\\" from a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to sack that employee. In the same way if a company decides that it has  political objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political manner. This is no worse than Rupert Murdoch using his papers as a political platform for his views.    ah yes you did not quote them, merely refered to them.    Your article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment, your signature and pretty well damn all else.     Are you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments on the substantive case?  The initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable judgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be harmed would be grounds for prior restraint. The second set of hearings on the substance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets act could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already. The part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate.  Here again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that information is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated to third parties. The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this case as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves.   The crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law. The censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government's ludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book.     Funny I saw that as a rejection of an assertion that you had made. Of course in rejecting an assertion I have to make a contrary assertion, since this assertion is unprovable I left it at that.   So far I have not seen you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to your own. You are attacking my anti-censorship view because I dare to accept the validity of some pro-censorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions.  Plus I am not an absolutist. I have this funny idea that the solution to this problem was not decided in 1789 by a group of white male gentry in secret session and sumarized in a single line. Furthermore I don't think that the issues are half as simple as you imply.   I don't think that you have geered your discourse to any audience save that of proving that you are the only person wearing a white hat. \",\" Oh, *really*???   I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed seperately on my pay stub.  While I'm not the only Canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks in spending, health insurance isn't on the table.  See our polls ... A better one might be the July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our major English newsmagazine) by Decima Research ... Decima president Allen Gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers, and Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of impossible election situations.  I haven't had a chance to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private system had support within statistical noise.  The Decima polls are considered definitive.  Even the new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \\\"libertarian\\\" faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these).  Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.

God's will can never be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  Jesus came to this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  If the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this cup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men and women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes. Is Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification was NOT the will of GOD.  God's will was that the Jewish people accept Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on the earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish people expected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what kind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very different world.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that age could have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on the earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would have continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to live with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to wait for Christ's return.  But when he returns will he be recognized and will he find faith on this earth.  Isn't it about time for his return.  It's been almost 2000 years.  Mike    And the two simplest refutations are these:  (1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded \\\"impact\\\" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.\",\": >What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost? : Since the Quadra is the only Mac able to deal with 5MB/s and Hard drives START : at 160MB I have NO idea. : For the Mac I have the following {These are ALL external} :  20MB $299 {$15/MB} :  52MB $379 {$7.3/MB} :  80MB $449 {$5.63/MB} : 120MB $569-$639 {$4.75-$5.33/MB : 210MB $979-$1029{$4.67-$4.90/MB} : 320MB $1499-$1549 {$4.68-$4.84/MB} : 510MB $1999-$2119 ($3.92-$4.31/MB} : etc  I thought you might want the latest prices:  As of MacWeek 4/12/93:    Meg:   Int   Ext   20M - couldn't find one available.   42M - $159  $219   85M - $199  $269   127 - $279  $349   170 - $299  $359  All above are quantum, low profile (1\\\") 3.5\\\" drives   240 - $369  $449   525 - $899  $979   1225- $1499 $1569 - the last three are quantum 1/2 height 3.5\\\" drives.

The dinner was instigated by the aunt of the hostess, whom I had met while visiting my wife in Galveston last October.  The dear old aunt (now  deceased) was very proud of her Jewish heritage, although not especially devout.  Her parents were both murdered in Nazi concentration camps in Austria during WWII because they were Jewish.  While conversing with her about politics, world affairs and religion, she remarked that it would  be a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to Atlanta.  Within two days of returning to Atlanta, her niece called to invite me over for dinner with her husband.  I went, not knowing really what to expect, other than stimulating conversation and fellowship.  What I got, however, was rather unexpected.  The thrust of the evening's discussion was to condemn the Reagan-Bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling  in federally funded family planning clinics, prohibiting the sterilization of minorities on welfare here and in Puerto Rico, on the ban on fetal tissue research, and against the Mexico City policy, \\\"which denies U.S. foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion.\\\"  The crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of \\\"overpopulation,\\\" rampant domestic crime, African starvation, unwed mothers, etc., on Christianity, rather on the fall of Adam.  Now, this is not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to  bring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesus and admonish me against converting to Judaism, \\\"because it involves too much study and effort.\\\"  And I did not even raise the prospect, nor try to convert them to the truth of Christ!  There was certainly no Jewish proselytism going on there.  And again, last November I toured a \\\"traditional\\\" Jewish synagogue and was subjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in general.  I realize that these are two isolated incidents, and that the best supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish, but from my experience, the modern Jew is not known for his proselytism.    --  boundary\",\"   I might suggest giving the management some more mumble time by asking the very leading question (in two or three parts)    What are your long term expectations of space market, what projects specifically are they funding by internal funds and at what levels and what competition do you expect in this  area.

It's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology, and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, the proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what exists now.      The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs, probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say) a DES keysearch machine.      As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination could acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since it would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked jodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency or organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak- nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for (say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the complaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars to build a keysearch machine for.)      How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?  How about home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers? \\\"Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately.

I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such \\\"storys\\\" about them. OK ? Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:    -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.          It has an hightech \\\"boiler\\\" but the rest is still verry verry           conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-          powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.          If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find          a chapter about the \\\"CARNOT-process\\\" which describes how to          get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason          for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an          temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one           side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water          again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the           energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to          let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \\\"cold\\\"          steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.          And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of          energy that carnot will give them.          The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !          The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,          because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in          AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent          radioactive pollution of the environment !              -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-          Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still          verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere          around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with          the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the          metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.          This is only for BWR's.

Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that would *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool.  Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ... Both Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just because his gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head  for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from  end-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by  Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall  for most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero  because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.  Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very  well, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over  Bellows' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all  those opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them. Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ...    Sure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.   I disagree. Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night.  The defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic, Nolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.   This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities, as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.   And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. Roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5, when you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of him for most of the season.   The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should they read the papers? They played 58 minutes of \\\"Burnsian\\\" hockey to shut down Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the  extra 2.  Red Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That's a guaranteed way to end the series 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ? The fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.   If you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should never have been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of work by Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped the puck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.\",\"BOOKS FOR SALE                           ================  Tally up any and all of the books you want and send me a message.

It is contagious and kills by attacking the covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose and the brain to swell up.  It is very treatable if caught in time.  There isn't much time, however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible to dying from bacterial meningitis.  Any infant with a fever who becomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where a spinal tap will show if they have meningitis.  Seizures can also occur.   It can live in the throat of carriers.

Just in case: it is two strips of different metals bonded together, which  when heated bend to one side (check out the blinker globe in your  christmas tree lights).  So when you turn on the power, this causes the bulb to work like a neon,  heating up and shorting out, thus providing a loop to power the heaters in  the main tube. When the tube fires, insufficient current runs through the  starter to keep the heat up and the bi-metalic strip straightens out  (O/C).

The service techs I talked to said, \\\"Oh sure, we stock those.\\\"  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to hold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.

They advertise these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the 5.25\\\" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for their CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.

If the chances of  promiscuity are larger, yet the rate of promiscuity is lower in the heterosexual community, doesn't that imply that the homo/bi sexual population is then  even more promiscuous than the raw statistics imply?   (No axe to grind here I'm just a scientist and I hate to see statistics abused.)   I am a hetero man and have had sex with one woman in my life (my wife).  It is  very pleasing to me to be able to say that.  I hope you have the same feeling as I do.  I also wish that you could (if you wanted) experience the joys and trials of being committed to someone for life (there is something about marriage that makes the commitment much greater than one might expect).    Don't forget about the culture.  Sadly, we don't (as a society) look upon homosexuality as normal (and as we are all too well aware, there are alot of people who condemn it).  As a result, the gay population is not encouraged to develop \\\"non-promiscuous\\\" relationships.  In fact there are many roadblocks put in the way of such committed relationships.  It is as if the heterosexual community puts these blocks there so as to perpetuate the claim that gays  are immoral.  \\\"My, if we allowed gays to marry, raise children ... we might just find out they're as moral as we are, can't have that can we?\\\"   Just some thoughts.

The Last Byte memory manager (which I downloaded for a trial) reports the chipset is an AddTech PCCHIP1 chipset, and it is able to activate the ram behind segments A000-FFFF, which can then be used for UMBs (except for video/BIOS).  I would like to write my own driver to activate the memory.  Does anyone know where I can get programming information on this chip?\",\" ..    Hmmm... Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was   trying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210   and my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need   to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe   place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is   that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it   wrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this   could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.    It could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one   wrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further   correct actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also   my NeXT that way.  Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any   problem, and at pretty high speeds too.  I don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is   pretty standard.\",\"  The Leafs have always been kind of comical.  During the second  Imlach era, when Darryl Sittler was called a \\\"cancer on the team\\\", he tore the C off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain.  Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly captaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead, Sittler got traded to Detroit.  Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and they took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago.  During Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach, in an  attempt  to  kiss the  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman, the Leafs took the A away from Brad Marsh to give to Leeman.  Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  tried to give it back to Marsh, he wouldn't take it neither.  The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late of the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably one of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  of playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be- came the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a captain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the players.  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  making sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.   -- \",\"This is a two-sided problem.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.       WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE      Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     \\\"scooped\\\" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study, Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:         Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year    Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year    Shuttle sources:   725,000 kilograms/year      The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \\\"the bends\\\", certainly some     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,     you're dying. The limits are not really known.

HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED      The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin     team's medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team     examined them, they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE \\\"FACE ON MARS\\\"      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

However, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against muslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and open hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know that historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone by the death penalty.  My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the law of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy.  I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \\\"fasad\\\". This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.   I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book. However, the charge of \\\"fasad\\\" can encompass a number of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the \\\"crisis\\\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people, not books.  The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz, presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred.  Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this point that the fatwa on \\\"fasad\\\" was issued.  The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The crime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being played out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\",\"      You're being too generous to the communists, I think.  In practice, communism has \\\"solved\\\" the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_ productive, and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the rest of the group is a bunch of sluggards.  The mass butchery of \\\"kulaks\\\" in the USSR is a good instance of this.     A poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to which people of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee.  I often wonder just what Castro would have done if the Cubans presently in Miami would have been forced to remain in Cuba.  Would they have revolted and killed him off, or been killed?     Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in, load it up so heavily with attack dogs, barbed wire, and land mines that most people fleeing over it die, and then give everyone the choice of obedience, prison, or flight.  This would be a bad science-fiction novel, if the East Germans hadn't actually done it.  The last person to die crossing the wall, as I recall, was an unarmed woman who was shot in the back.  Erich Honecker was going to go on trial for that, but he fled to socialists in Chile.

To a virgin espoused to a  man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's  name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\\\"Hail,  thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed  art thou among women.\\\"_  Now, now, hold that line of thought - \\\"the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women\\\" - while you read on....  In the book, \\\"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of Devotion to Mary\\\" by Peter Lappin:  The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible that the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title \\\"The Conception of Saint Anne\\\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary is the incorruptible timber \\\"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christ's sinless body\\\"; she is \\\"God's Eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\\\"  Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus, she was hailed as \\\"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\\\". ... At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a  greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_. ...  Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. From \\\"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\\\" by John A. Hardon:  Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism. Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).  Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall: In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over: -They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the  power to think and to choose freely. -The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality  and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. -They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,  the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding  title to enter heaven. By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely.  Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day...  Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ (I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):  Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born  AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was: \\\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst women\\\".  Even Mary was confused about this greeting.  Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (Adam and Eve before their sin):     Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)     Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)     The Lord is with you (At those times, God would                 definitely want to be with those He                 has made _blessed_)     Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)  At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body of Christ and so,  Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart. \",\"  What I was talking about was using an Tek terminal as your X display.

The FBI and the BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their stupidity and lies.      Now before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as  a bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.  They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet,  whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into town on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and  wondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers. First, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they didn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got it.  After the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were coming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that. Well, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.  Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to them they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised Koresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                   The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he  \\\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out. His grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise David Koresh.\\\"  Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a logical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.  Here's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must be done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?  I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how much money this was costing.  That was the start of the \\\"Justification\\\" part part of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.  But, back to the plan.  It is considered \\\"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\\\" to execute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.  They knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not sure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the  compound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.  I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR (Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were subjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical  agent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.  I have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of thing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.  We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these people 51 days.    I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole thing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks changed my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:  \\\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\\\"  It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.  One more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic weapons on the premises.                                                                 HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!  THEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!  Still, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him. For all of this my President takes full responsibility.  What a guy! I hope he gets it.                               \",\"As I won't be able to make the Joust this summer (Job related time  conflict :'^{   ), I plan instead on going to the Rider Rally in  Knoxville.

We don't know if it actually applies to reality, we don't know if anything in the world is infinite.   You don't know if the universe is actually continuous. Continuum is another mathematical concept (based on infinity) used to explain things in a certain way.   I have a pretty good idea of what infinity is. It's a man-made concept, and like many man-made concepts, it has evolved through time. Ancient Greeks had a different understanding of it.   Precicely. We don't even know if infinity applies to reality. \",\"Read this through once or twice.  Then replace \\\"prince\\\" with \\\"government\\\" or \\\"president\\\", as appropriate, and read it again.    [From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by Daniel Donno.]   In order to keep their lands secure, some princes have disarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against themselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have destroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular circumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself will allow.   To begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince disarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal, while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all, nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties and dangers should receive advantages.     When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by showing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you. Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful subjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired state has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is full of examples proving that this is so.   But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire it; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to his original domain.   ...\",\"     1.

Second, I disagree with the Pen's weak spot being defense and goaltending - for a couple of reasons.  Barrasso has had a spectacular year - no slow start, consistently sharp, GAA < 3.0, and  leads the league in wins.  Tommy deserves the Vezina.  Given the lack of  respect he commands, though, I doubt he will win it.  The other reason  concerns the Pens' team defense.  They are hovering around 3rd or 4th in the fewest goals allowed.  That is a big improvement for them, and it indicates that they are playing better team defense.   We'll see.  It'll be fun.\",\"   Yes, there is such a thing as eye dominance, although I am not sure if this dominance refers to perscription strength.

I was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this film for handling infectious diseases (and similar toxic substances). Clearly they \\\"faked\\\" a lot of the computer & robotic technology; certainly at the time it was made most of that was science fiction itself, let alone the idea of a \\\"space germ\\\".

John McKay vax2.concordia.ca \",\" Every city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in the last two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though I haven't seen any Glock's).   With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a  large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand him and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something  like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that \\\"different is good\\\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in  more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a certain \\\"propriatory nature\\\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to  learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.   Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.    I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time.    Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off.   The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always  take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later).     Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).     All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and  shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.   Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.   I think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it's a small one B^)).   I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.    9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the street cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry the \\\"Highway Patrolman\\\".

I bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles) after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude,  and Celica.  Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.    My criteria: a \\\"fun\\\" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K. I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out. The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag. Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS). The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy. The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.   I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me. The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went. The Celica was \\\"ok\\\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat overpriced too) in non-turbo form. I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it for its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind. I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more. Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)  The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its reliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:  My dislikes: Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal. Headlights have \\\"stuck\\\" up a few times (weather?) air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch) condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely. crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical) parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical). assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not  stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke. Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies! Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when I bash my head on the corner. horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference) Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car   My Likes: engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1 handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits) transmission (the 5 speed is a must) usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere) Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive) stability at 100+mph (high gearing though) low cowl (good visibility in front) Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather) ABS/Air bag (see above) rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important) No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!) Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)  As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.    The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a  potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable. If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently (if that's \\\"better\\\" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass around you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with the heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine. Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so I can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).   I prefer cloth to leather anyway.    I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water  generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the Eagles (and I was really trying).   There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \\\"pouch\\\" but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO. And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!  Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the  water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.

The region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and Ossetia, but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former Soviet Union to fight for independence.  Lezghis, who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about the conscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared war with Armenia.  They also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia, which were effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national borders that had been only lines on a map.  A rally of more than 3,000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription and demand a separate \\\"Lezghistan\\\" alarmed the Azerbaijani government.  Officials in Baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot six demonstrators to death. But the government announced strict security measures and began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of Lezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.  Visitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon after the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.  At the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a war they say is not theirs.  \\\"I have been drafted, but I won't go,\\\" said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth glinting in the sun. \\\"Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have nothing to do with Armenia.\\\"  More than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.  Malik Kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 locals drafted in 1992 had served.  \\\"The police don't force people to go,\\\" he said. \\\"They are afraid of an uprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan.\\\"  All the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but disagreed on how the protest came about.  Some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was about to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.  Others said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the Lezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan.  \\\"We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about draft orders,\\\" said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval.  \\\"We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis,  the Russians.\\\"  In the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties, in what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.  By 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they came under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the  600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.  About half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan.  \\\"We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine,\\\" complained Mais Talibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar, included brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan.  \\\"We want our own country,\\\" he said. \\\"We want to be able to move about easily. But Baku won't listen to us.\\\"  Physically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other Azerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same  jobs and intermarrying to some degree.  But the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and Persian with strong guttural vowels.  Azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest ethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary  school classes in their language.  Autonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from Azerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the  Talish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern Azerbaijan.    \",\":  [ . . . . . ] : : Personally, I feel that since religion have such a poweful : psychological effect, we should let theists be.

In this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd, then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache.  The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then it is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.

I will oblige.  My name is Elias Davidsson, Icelandic citizen, born in Palestine. My mother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables' (at that times this group was defined as 'Jews'). She was forced to go to Palestine due to many  cynical factors. I have meanwhile settled in Iceland (30 years ago) and met many people who were thrown out from my homeland, Palestine, because of the same reason (they belonged to the 'indesirables'). These people include my neighbors in Jerusalem with the children of whom I played as child. Their crime: Theyare not Jews. My conscience does not accept such injustice, period. My work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism and racial discrimination. Those who protest against such practices in Arab countries have my support - as long as their protest is based on a principled position, but not as a tactic to deflect criticism from Israel. The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.  The Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activities undertaken under my guidance in different domains, and which command the support of many volunteers in Iceland. It is however not a formal institution and works with minimal funds.  Professionally I am music teacher and composer. I have published  several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe.  I would hope that discussion about Israel/Palestine be conducted in a more civilized manner. Calling names is not helpful.\",\"   More info please.

Historically even the most uncivilized of peoples have exhibited     signs of compassion by allowing humanitarian aid to reach civilian    populations. Even the Nazis did this much.     It seems as though from now on Turkey will publicly pronounce     themselves 'hypocrites' should they choose to continue their    condemnation of the Serbians.    --\",\"Archive-name: space/addresses Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:38:55 $  CONTACTING NASA, ESA, AND OTHER SPACE AGENCIES/COMPANIES  Many space activities center around large Government or International Bureaucracies. In the US that means NASA.  If you have basic information requests: (e.g., general PR info, research grants, data, limited tours, and ESPECIALLY SUMMER EMPLOYMENT (typically resumes should be ready by Jan.  1), etc.), consider contacting the nearest NASA Center to answer your questions.  EMail typically will not get you any where, computers are used by investigators, not PR people. The typical volume of mail per Center is a multiple of 10,000 letters a day. Seek the Public Information Office at one of the below, this is their job:  NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is the civilian space agency of of the United States Federal Government. It reports directly to the White House and is not a Cabinet post such as the military Department of Defense.  Its 20K+ employees are civil servants and hence US citizens.  Another 100K+ contractors also work for NASA.

JPL has different requirements  for unsolicited research proposals and summer hires. For instance in  the latter, an SF 171 is useless.

So  this is consistent. It is also consistent with the new \\\"Comercial  applications\\\" that NASA and Clinton are pushing so hard.   Did anyone catch the rocket that was launched with a movie advert  all over it? I think the rocket people got alot of $$ for painting  up the sides with the movie stuff. What about the Coke/Pepsi thing  a few years back? NASA has been trying to find ways to get other  people into the space funding business for some time. Frankly, I've  thought about trying it too. When the funding gets tight, only the  innovative get funded. One of the things NASA is big on is co-funding.  If a PI can show co-funding for any proposal, that proposal has a SIGNIFICANTLY higher probability of being funded than a proposal with more merit but no  co-funding.

Even if it were possible, I think it is a bad idea since it smacks real strongly of double jeopardy.  A civil case for damages is fine since that is a trial that would proceed regardless of the first.  I think a bad precedent has already been set in the King trial in L.A. and something like this would make it worse.  Regardless of how bad anybody feels about this decision, it must stand that charges of assault were not not proven against the three marines and that's how it should stand.

Since there is a lot of crossover between gamers and science fiction and fantasy fans, I will mention that I am the editor and publisher of RADIO FREE THULCANRA, a Christian-oriented science fiction fanzine.  It is not a Christian magazine with a special interest in science fiction.  It is a science fiction fanzine with a special interest in Christianity.  Gaming is not a major topic of discussion but it has come up in some letters.  (No, there are no arguments about whether D&D is satanic.  People who think it is are not likely to be reading RFT.)  Anyway, I am now working on the April issue.  I will send a sample copy to any reader of soc.religion.christian who requests it.  It is printed on paper, so requests should include a snail-mail address. ------- Marty Helgesen Bitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu\",\"The  following  jazz  magazines  will  go for the best            OFFER  received.

The JNF offered a premium deal, so the owners took advantage of it.   It's called commerce.

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.  Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch.  That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game, Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about  winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch.  Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible.  Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games.  I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.  But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan.    -- The Beastmaster   \",\"Is there a fast 'n dirty way to kill the line spiking that occurs when an inductive load is turned on sometime other than at zero-crossing of the AC cycle?

As for how foods taste:  If I'm not allergic to MSG and I like the taste of it, why shouldn't I use it?  Saying I shouldn't use it is like saying I shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor has an ulcer.  People have long modified the taste of food by additives, whether they be chiles, black pepper, salt, cream sauces, etc.  All of these things cloud the flavor of the food.

I will attempt to construct a facsimile of what was previously said, and  then address Kermit's offering.  John Redelfs originally wrote...    jr> I learned that a man cannot frustrate justice by repenting on his   jr> death bed because repentance is more than a feeling of remorse.  It   jr> requires faith in Christ proven by following him, by keeping his   jr> commandments.  Such cannot be accomplished on ones deathbed.  Tom Albrecht responded...    ta> So Jesus must have lied to the thief on the cross.  John Redelfs wrote back that...    jr> Paradise and salvation are not the same thing.  Salvation is better.   jr> Refer to John 14:2.  I responded to John that...    rw>    I don't see the effort to equate salvation with paradise.   rw>   rw>    Rather, I see implied the fact that only those who are saved   rw> may enter paradise.  To which Kermit wrote...  kt> Incomplete reference: kt> kt> See also the discussion: Did Jesus go into Hell in the BibleStudy group kt> for the arguments that Paradise and Hell(sheol) are places after death kt> The discussion (no LDS were involved as far as I could see) argued using kt> standard Christian argument from the Bible that pretty much support the kt> LDS position. kt> kt>    Christ went to paridise after his death and burial. kt> kt>    He taught the prisoners and freed them from Darkness. kt> kt>    When he was resurrected, he had not yet ascended to his father. kt> kt> The arguement centered around what was or wasn't the proper biblical kt> terms for those places.       I respond.       The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise      before entering into heaven. No one has made a point for or against       that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox      belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16),       the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).       The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent      on their death bed. Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was      contradictory to what John's position put forward. The thief on the       cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of       the righteous dead. John's position possibly needs to be reworked.      Kermit needs to address the topic at hand.\",\" I totally agree.  Really, the only people this is going to benefit, are those who live in the cities where the train stops.

They include the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli, the fact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people, and the historical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem.   When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948, the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit religious shrines.  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan, who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  The Jordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned a Jewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in their latrines.   Israel has allowed individuals of all religions into Jerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness to control the city.   Also, I should point out that Islam is not centered in Jerusalem, but has holy sites there.  The home of Islam is Mecca, where all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).  Unlike Israeli Jerusalem, Jews and Christians are not allowed in Saudi Mecca.

(AP) -- A police officer afraid he would be fired for allegedly assaulting a teen-ager walked into an auto body shop wher the youth worked, said \\\"You're going to die\\\" and fatally shot him and two others, police said.  A fourth youth was wounded.  A fifth escaped injury by hiding under a car.  The wounded youth ran about two blocks to a house after the shooting at about midnight Tuesday and called police.  He was hospitalized in satisfactory condition Wednesday.

In this configuration, X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.     The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables.

Around a million Americans every year defend themselves with firearms.  In many of these cases the defender doesn't even have to fire a shot!  The mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the deterrent that is needed.  I don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  But, taking away the right of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent crime problem in this country.  If honest, law-abiding citizens are unable to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will be able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling guns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns should be banned by the Klintonistas.   Statistics, por favor?   See my previous post.  That ought to set you straight.   People have the right to keep and bear arms no matter what the Constitution says.  That means that even if the 2nd Amendment is repealed the *people* (that's all American citizens FYI) will *still* have the right to keep and bear arms.

I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment      before the white throne. Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate. They cried for the rock and the mountains. They prayed, but their prayers were too late. The soul that had put off salvation,  \\\"Not tonight I'll get saved by and by.  No time now to think of ....... religion,\\\"  Alas, he had found time to die. And I saw a Great White Throne.  Now, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for motivation, yet Jesus thought it was.  Paul thought it was.  Paul said,  \\\"Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.\\\"  Today, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don't tell people anymore, that there's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.    As Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a place called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to experience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we can to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going to \\\"outer darkness.\\\".    Jesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He prepared it for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere, that God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the elect are the \\\"whosoever will\\\" and the nonelect are the \\\"whosoever wont's.\\\"  Whether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but its practical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, \\\"Ye would not.\\\"    Now, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be Christians.  Have you ever said to somebody, \\\"I don't believe in hell.  I believe in the religion of Jesus.\\\"  But did you know that Jesus talked more about hell than He did about heaven!  \\\"Oh I believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount.\\\"  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the mount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire.  Several times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over in the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah.  Not Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God.  The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't want to see them go there.  Now, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus, not some angry Baptist preacher, that said, \\\"where the worm never dies, and where the fire never goes out.\\\"  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell a \\\"furnace of fire.\\\"  It was Jesus that used the word, \\\"condemnation.\\\"  \\\"And this is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.    How can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?  Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about.  When my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, \\\"outer darkness.\\\"    Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not a party.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it \\\"outer darkness.\\\"  \\\"Outer\\\" -away from God.  \\\"Darkness\\\" -God is light.    No when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated Jesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As my son would say, an \\\"awesome\\\" thought.    \\\"My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?\\\"  Hell is isolation.  There's no fellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embrace in hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement in hell.    \\\"I thirst.\\\"  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it eternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, will crave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way and I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost.    In a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life ministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the illustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to Jack.  \\\"They sing these songs and read Bible verses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you think God would send me to hell?\\\"  Jack answered by saying, \\\"Yes I think he would!\\\"  Of course the barber said, \\\"What do you mean by that.\\\"  \\\"Well if you can't stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to God now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'd be miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match what you really are.\\\"   It makes a man think.  The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't ask me how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He died, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He purchased eternal life for the \\\"whosoever wills.\\\"  He suffered eternal judgment.    A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying \\\"Everybody is going to be saved eventually.\\\"  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separate them.  The sheep from the goats.  \\\".After you die there's a probationary period in which God prepares you for heaven.\\\"  No, my Bible says that \\\"It is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment.\\\"  Some of the cultist believe in annihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squished out.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven.    I don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy listening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a place called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any hope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't found it.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a God of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placed us in a \\\"uni\\\"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications.  1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others.  Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out.  \\\"Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we persuade men.\\\"  2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awful chance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if you are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and suffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its like Dirty Harry said, \\\"You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well do you?\\\"  \\\"A man's got to know his limitations.\\\"  Don't be one of the \\\"whosoever wont's.\\\"  \",\"I replied to your message, however, it is listed as a new topic with the title: \\\"rnitedace and violence\\\".

None of this sounds like a \\\"small fishing village\\\" by any stretch of the imagination.  Centuries later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had \\\"opulent and flourishing bazaars\\\" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was \\\"noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware.\\\" During the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held by Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)  In [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: \\\"other *major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and Zahlah.\\\"  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of the Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982) on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's withdrawel in 1984, \\\"Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy.\\\"  If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present, why is it always called a city (or, above, a \\\"major city\\\")?  Why does it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities in Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the list (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?

(One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also, so I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for the cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In particular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.      I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed. Don't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to  the other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make a case for Tyre having been singled out?   They had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]: Tyre \\\"receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes and from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a large series of coins, occasionally in gold ...\\\"  The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fit your characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems to have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching when you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small fishing village.   A Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low. He happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian, _Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969). The same sentence, in fact.  He defends the fulfillment of the prophecy using the same argument you are using, an argument that I haven't seen in print anywhere else, which is why I jumped to the conclusion that you were quoting Josh.  (I tried to find the Jidejian book, but it isn't listed in Books in Print.  Can you tell me more about it? Her descriptions are so much at odds with everything else I've read; I'm curious to know why.)\",\"I have a Sega Genesis (barely used) that IUd like to sell with the following games:  Sonic the Hedgehog (I) Revenge of Shinobi Thunderforce III  I'm asking $160 OBO.

When someone claimed that guerillas were manifestations of popular sentiment, the topic arose:\\\"When does a civilian stop becoming a civilian?\\\".  If he houses and shelters guerillas of his own free will, aiding them, has he violated his \\\"civilian\\\" status?   But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways? If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Afterall, Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.   That is not exactly true.  The Hizbollah and their affiliated groups have made several attempts to infiltrate the border of Israel.   True, but the Syrians did allow (until at least 1984) guerillas to operate in the areas that were under their control, provided that those guerillas were attacking Israeli lines.  The problem is that Syria is also not as stable a partner for long term peace as others in the area might be. \",\"A friend of mine is seeing an acupuncturist and wants to know if there is any danger of getting AIDS from the needles.

Ryan> Another good place for your helmet is your mirror (!). I kid you not.  This is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbing layers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer. Most helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner compacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or delaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years following his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose up to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I have a video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.  Puncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, and other relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when the comfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously degrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of \\\"parking your lid\\\" on the mirrors, I suggest you look under the comfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantly damaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet.\",\"  The problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about the Bible which they don't actually believe or practice. I've known all sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to the fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the  conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is a (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyone who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition. While I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official position of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).  The particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in terms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact  that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane  and give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this  (other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would  show them that what they claim about the Bible and what they  actually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.  While this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians, I would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this case, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually put into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and look at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying to express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the Christian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as \\\"Word of God\\\", \\\"inerrant\\\", \\\"infallibale\\\", \\\"The Manufacturer's Handbook\\\", \\\"The only rule of faith and practice in the church today\\\" to describe the Bible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at the mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably false and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even when the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical example is from the garden of Eden where God asks \\\"Where are you?\\\" and Adam explains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had answered God's words he would have said something like \\\"I'm here in this tree.\\\" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these words are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of the place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases and explanations that others use.  I hope this helps. --                                                                      ___ Bill Rea                                                            (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---\",\"I recently attended an allery seminar.

(formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the process of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0  and C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent Graphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through  June 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with  ansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge  tape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products.   X Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts:   1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types    available through a large collection of X resources. 2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers. 3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization. 4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback. 5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget     library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar     to X programmers. 6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge's UIM/X product.    This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical    layout of an application.   C Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:   1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library    is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C    standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C. 2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse     interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control    with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization. 3. Large collection of high-level application functions for \\\"two-call\\\"    graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available    with minimal programming effort. 4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling    the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot    the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can     control the event loop.

I have heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic. Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/ home use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach.  I  have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily: I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must  be different than what is the logical ordering.  To permanently reorder (to  use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records  appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order) exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach  database), and then copying the exported files back to the original  filename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really  like about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than  the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).  Paradox also  takes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12MB) and RAM).\",\" Okay, that's good.  I'm typing this from exactly the same setup.

Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography. Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something like DES) for the encryption.  How could the \\\"back door\\\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers used in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.  Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most straightforward to me.)  Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the message itself has a \\\"dual key\\\" property, that possession of either of two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from the DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.  It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early knowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with Clipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.\",\" I disagree.  People marry each other.  When they commit fully to each other as life partners, they are married.  The ceremony may assist in emphasizing the depth of such a commitment, but is of itself nothing.

However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!).  On a related topic, who is to say that \\\"color\\\" is more or less correct than \\\"colour\\\" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API terms such as \\\"XAllocColor\\\" and \\\"colormap\\\".  In a world that uses the term \\\"Windows\\\" to refer to Microsoft Windows, perhaps the time has come to accept \\\"X Windows\\\" as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say, \\\"the X Window System\\\" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it. Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short, snappy, descriptive title (\\\"X\\\" is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called \\\"Microsoft Windows\\\" or \\\"the Microsoft Window System\\\" or how about just plain \\\"Microsoft\\\"!  To summarise (or should that be \\\"summarize\\\") the point of this message: I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be \\\"windowing system\\\"). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System. \",\"I also suffer from these video \\\"artefacts\\\".

It can convert bitmaps to Corel art format.  These can then be imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap. Result - the file is completely in Corel format and can be SCODAL'ed no problem!  BUT the slight problem with this, which makes the solution less than idea, is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments.  So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to image.

I'm not trying to be    contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction    and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?    What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that    Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?    This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically    stood by the Pope.  The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This is the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his departure from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands from *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be disobeyed.  My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it would be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the present situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated. Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the Catholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.     It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is    disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over    authority and discipline.    The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic Faith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the Catholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.  There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the Catholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an hour, probably.  Take the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book on what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio de Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old catechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the Catholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He innoculated the people against what was coming.  Well, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came when the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope recovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really wanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence. The Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.  The injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop was installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's clergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New Mass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass. The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop was *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The priests would just start building new churches; the people were completely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the bishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.  The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to canon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V. Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.  During all this process, the people of Campos, not just private individuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending petitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist bishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome. Eventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.     My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)     If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.    If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and    there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that    I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end of the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in Catholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an instant non-Catholic.  The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are doing, they would be shocked!     We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\"    traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter    East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.  This isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body of traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are especially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is.     I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow    error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`    I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  That's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job since the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors spread that it's pitiful.  Infallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the short term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In fact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large sections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been much more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long run.     What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement    regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how    do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?    Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.    Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,    one way or the other.  Yes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what is he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of the Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic schools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?     It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the    Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\",\"  If anyone gets the New York Times, the Edit page has a transcript of a VHS from Hams describing their methods of torture and  execution.

Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois. ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.  The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king, who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which  the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million, His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual, seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of slots.  The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions supporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from  70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside). According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and  the Pacific Rim.   RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money. Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began  negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in  Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time. Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way that people operate.  For example \\\"everybody can sell you everything.\\\"   Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.  Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who  went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually, he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the  Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to  allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.  The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied  Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in  Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners :-)  Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is  apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them  specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their  satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They  have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place now.  Tidbits:  *  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big business because big business is just like what they have over there, except that \\\"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\\\"  *  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months.  *  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia, and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.  *  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith.  Italy gets a new government \\\"every two weeks\\\" but we don't worry  because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.  *  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting 25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \\\"equivalent\\\" value in  rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government.  *  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western  satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites, which was rather reassuring.  *  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much  shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the  difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition, shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date hardware. \",\"I sent a response to the White House at   0005895485@MCIMAIL.COM (White House)  and received a nice, automatic reply from MICMAIL noting, in passing, that if I had included a SNail address, I would get a reply in due course.

(Much thanks to Jayne K who is already supporting me with kind words and prayers!)  I've been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs.  I'm female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that on seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this company.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one; someone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.  I'm really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.  There was no note.  I do not know if it was:   - someone's idea of an innocent joke, that went awry  - someone's sick idea of flirting  - an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)  I dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question, I don't know the answer so I take a military specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a Bible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to Corinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love Association?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.  I can lock up my desk, but I can't lock up every book I have in the office.  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into my briefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home to find such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone wants to do to my body.  To make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for leaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go to the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one could be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my number was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a neutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite the fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer.  I need some prayers --- I can't stop crying. I am so deeply wounded that it's ridiculous.  I feel like I'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel like I'm a sub-human piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simple phone call saying \\\"We're leaving for Mary's lunch a little early so that Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting...\\\"  Please pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously turned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing me so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray for my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a whole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This company, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment isn't tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or threatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven times in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company do me no good when I'm terrified or healing from the latest assault.)  And please pray that I don't turn into an automaton because of this. That's my bad habit: \\\"ignore it and it will go away\\\", \\\"you're not worth anyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this\\\", \\\"you're right, you are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this way\\\", \\\"you are just an object\\\", \\\"you prostitute your mind to this company so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there as well?\\\", \\\"what makes you think women aren't just possessions, and nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\\\" This is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major depressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don't come into my head and stay there, triggering depression.  Please pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and God. In a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to God, and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesn't drop me from his loving hand, but it's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand, look down, think I'm falling and forget that God's still holding on to me.)

The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan, head of the Armenian defence ministry press centre, as saying Ankara had been sending  planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops.  It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey about the impermissibility of such actions,\\\" the journalists quoted Duliyan as  saying.  \\\"If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate measures. We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft units.\\\"  Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in the conflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in which more than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.  The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to Azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.  A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly on a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket launchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.  Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops and arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from where they were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku.  \\\"All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the country which is affording military assistance over our airspace,\\\" he said.  Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops  involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.  Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive along the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front.  \\\"The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's) leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire,\\\" the agency said.  Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in Karabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of Commonwealth leaders.  \\\"The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the protection of the Karabakh population,\\\" Tass quoted him as saying.       At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have collapsed.  \\\"The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the legal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh,\\\" he said. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not  been recognised by any other country.  Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future peace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.  Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender Gamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with Armenia, had resigned.  Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office. Khabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of Baku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev. There was no official confirmation.  \",\" a lot of batters lean in when pitches come.  rickey's crouch tends to exaggerate that, i think.  \\\"a great player to watch if you forget who he is\\\" - \\\"unbiased\\\"... hmmm...\",\"      That's true, but according to your stats, Chicago has just as good a record as Toronto.  It's interesting that you should list Toronto ahead of Chicago.\",\"-*-----   I hope Gordon Banks did not mean to imply that notions such as hard-to-see candida infections causing various problems should not be investigated.  Many researchers have made breakthroughs by  figuring out how to investigate things that were previously thought \\\"virtually impossible to test for.\\\"  Indeed, I would be surprised if \\\"candida overbloom\\\" were such a phenomena.  I would think that candida would produce signature byproducts whose measure would then set a lower bound on the  extent of recent infection.  I realize this might get quite  tricky and difficult, probably expensive, and likely inconvenient or uncomfortable to the subjects, but that is not the same as  \\\"virtually impossible.\\\"\",\"Add me to the list of bugged 230 owners.  I had a bunch of problems regarding sleep/wakeup/restart with the 230 when I first got it, both with and without the techworks ram.  Finally it \\\"died\\\", wouldn't start, until I  opened the docking door (which snaps open) and  the machine came up fine, but with the clock a few decades off.  Apple  replaced the processor board.  Now,   twice the machine has frozen (no mouse action)   twice the machine has refused to wake up.  Acutally, the backlighting     came on, and the disk spins when the power adaptor is plugged in     (but not with a good battery).     The first time this happened removing both power adaptor and battery       for ~1 minute brought the machine back.     The second time this happened the machine wouldn't wake up until       powered down for about 30 minutes.  The screen had what looked       like red horizontal lines accross it.     Both timse the file \\\"fax modem preferences\\\" has been corrupted       according to disinfectent).  I have removed all the fax and modem software, and the third party memory, and am waiting to see if it happens again.  forrest  \",\" And another survivor claims he heard someone shouting \\\"The fire's started!\\\". Odd terminology.  That's what one says when you know a fire is planned, not  when one occurs by accident.  We will have to wait and see what the evidence  shows, assuming one is willing to believe any evidence offered by the  \\\"distrustful ones\\\".   Neither.  Again I was merely addressing the sanity level of the players.   I agree that the BATF handled the affair badly from day one.  BTW, I heard  on the news today that the affadavit behind the no-knock warrant was unsealed  today.  Grenade launcher was the only thing on the list that I found  unusual.   Ambitious news reporters could use the documentary filmed by an Australian  in 1992 on the compound grounds to help identify survivors.  I, for one,  will check their stories for consistency with what I learned in a long  news story about that documentary.   Certainly there is some room for doubt.  I certainly reserve the right  to change my opinions when new evidence warrants such a change.  If I  were conspiratorially minded, however, I would never be able to change  my mind, because any evidence I disliked would have to be a lie  fabricated by the \\\"distrustful ones\\\".  \",\" I just talked to a rep for my AT&T mastercard regarding this:  There is no maximum claim, and you only have to notify them of the warranty when the  item needs repair.  If it can't be repaired, you get the amount you paid for it. Curiously though, the AT&T Gold mastercard has a limit of $1000 on claims. Definitely not upgrading to that card...:)  -Bryan \",\"  Most of the points you made about Lopez v. Berryhill/Olson have been made by others, and realizing that Lopez must be the second coming of Frank Thomas, I have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom of his supporters.   See?  This is essentially what everyone was doing  -  comparing Lopez to one of the best players in the game.  I'm really looking forward to seeing this can't-miss superstar now.  As for Thomas, I remember being an advocate of his being brought up in 1990 even though he was only 21 or 22 (can't remember).  But who did the Sox have at first? Calderon?  Martinez?  Kittle?  The spot was there.  The talent was there.  Sure, I say go for it.  I am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomas was after his AA season in 1989, and I am not convinced that Olson/ Berryhill are nearly as bad as Kittle/Martinez were.  BTW, I don't think Thomas was hurt by those three months.       Well, if we can't compare our guy to one of the best in the game, let's compare our decision to one of the most \\\"Boneshead\\\", right?  Cal Eldred was 24 when he came up, with a full season at AAA and a longer minor league career.  Frankly, I don't know why he didn't make the club in 1992.  Bones is a year younger with a lousy prior history, and just watching him makes me think that I missed a  career as a big-league pitcher.  No one -  I repeat NO ONE  - laughed louder than I did at the Sheffield trade.  (Though I guess Mieske has a future.)  (I take it back. McIlvaine may have laughed louder.)     aw, gee, shucks.  thanks guy.  except I missed the part where SDCN's admit they're wrong.    -- The Beastmaster \",\" The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.  Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple (early March).  Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is it because too many people take French and German in college to make the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance. Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.   For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.  Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.   Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care.  At that point, they wouldn't even consider a \\\"voucher\\\" approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.   It is \\\"free\\\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda.  The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer  1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For  1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance. Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.   Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.  When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's public health insurance plan.  gld\",\"I'm trying to figure out how to operate a Pioneer Laserdisc LD-1000 that I bought at a surplus store.

If the NSA comes up with the numbers, that's a trap door you could drive a truck through.   Me either.     It seems from the following that the CPSR is atleats starting to question this bogosity:      ---------------------------------------------------------------- April 16, 1993 Washington, DC                 COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC            DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE          Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today called for the public disclosure of technical data underlying the government's newly-announced \\\"Public Encryption Management\\\" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super- secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.          According to NIST, the technical specifications and the Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of such standards.          CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the so-called \\\"digital signature standard\\\" (DSS), a communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard. NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the DSS.          David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications, as reflected in today's official statement,  \\\"a step in the right direction.\\\"  But he questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  \\\"At a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation.  It is not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the development process.\\\"          CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society.

Why do you say that? It sounds like you're suggesting  Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella.      Which reports are those?      I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter. Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem.       I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners. Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.     As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak  defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have.

And to be honest as well, I believe you have not asked my god to come to you.  Why do I say this? Because by the things you write on the net, and the manner with which you write them, you show me that you made up your own god and are attempting to pass him off as the real thing.  I got news for you. Yours doesn't at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn't come to you because your god doesn't exist.   I am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind. What I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.   Be true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain  knowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the Bible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond our shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself   to seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a person who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find  something to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one will gain with that attitude is folly.  Be careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even though they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not. Be assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such deep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied.  I will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \\\"You will never be thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\\\"   From King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):      \\\"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;      to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\\\"   Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55:     \\\"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\\\"   And in John 3:16:     \\\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,    that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal    life.\\\"   You are included in \\\"whosoever\\\".  And I also pray that the Father is drawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting to talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the making.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure stoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became on of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.  You see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because you could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack Christians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul, proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.  Or you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would  probably say to you: \\\"Satan would surely like to have you.\\\"  Why so? Because Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great moments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task he did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the faith to walk on water as Jesus did.  You asked \\\"Why not believe in Zeus?\\\"  Zeus didn't offer eternal life. You got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus. \",\"Hello Netlanders:         I am a novice X user with a question for any Xgod.

I have loaded the Basic OS (which includes nsu) and        inet utilities (tcp/ip).        I ftp-ed the XFree86 (X11R5) binaries and installed properly.    I can execute startx and run X-windows with no problems.  However, if I try to access the tape drive while in X, the  machine locks up instantly.  If I am out of X and access the  tape, the tape drive works fine.  Soon as I try to  startx again; the screen changes modes, but, the grey background  pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked.  I have to login  from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system.   I've contacted Esix about this problem.  They claim THEIR X-window X11R4  server (which I have) works with the Wangtek tape drive.  They also   claim I only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run X; I don't  need inet (tcp/ip).  My experience has been that I need BOTH to get  XFree86 to work.  I'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet  packages to get X to work unless the inet package is causing my problem.

The hardware will automagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg, anything with high IRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now.     I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1 on IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of the interrupts in between. Works just great.    If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the higher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.    It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the   first IRQ serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response --  especially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no problems.

Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the faces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing the two shared vertices).  Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.  Using the edge dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face.  And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently orienting the entire surface.  Find the average of the vertices in this surface.  Using that point, calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face's orientation.  If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces are oriented correctly.  If it is negative, reverse their orientations (mark them CLOCKWISE).  If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another face and go through the algorithm again.  At the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed before facet normals are found.

Later, in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford, a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis Alicea, a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter.  What the Hell is he thinking.  Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt, But torre said he liked Gilkey coming off the bench.  Gilkey hit over 300 last year, what does he have to do to start, The guy would be starting on most every team in the league.  Furthermore, in Sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate,  The replay showed Bucky Dent the third base coach looking down the line and waving lankford home,   I can't take this anymore  brian, a very distressed cardinal fan. -- \",\"The following is available in some FTP archive somewhere, I insert my comments liberally throughout this demonic memo of Big Brotherdom:      Look!

Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring and tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on  the frontend.  Also remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm equivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets dropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly 12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.  But dropping it that far down is probably a big no-no.

I hear Vida> that pilots and steward/esses have a limit as to the maximum Vida> number of flying hours -- what are these limits?  What are the Vida> main problems associated with too many long-haul (over 4 hours) Vida> trips?  The crew rest requirements are to prevent undue fatigue.  The cockpit crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew limits for this reason.  Crew rest requirements address amount of time on duty plus rest time.  A tired crew is an accident-prone crew.  The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military aircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably pressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members DNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.  Flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear.  If you don't have big pressure changes, you may not know that you've got a problem.  But if you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an airliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem. Ears don't clear readily because of allergies, colds, infections, and anatomical problems.  The last won't change; the first three can. Medication (decongestants or antihistimines, usually) can help. Chewing gum, sucking hard candy (or a bottle for babies), yawning--these will help all four causes.  \",\"I recently had a case of shingles and my doctors wanted to give me intravenous Acyclovir.  It was a pain finding IV sites in my arms...can I have some facts about how advantageous it is to give intravenous antibiotics rather than oral?\",\"To what follows, our moderator has already answered the charge of  arrogance more ably that I could have done so, so I will confine myself to answering the charge of illogic.     This is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was, taught to think. It is the fundamental premis \\\"A is not not-A\\\". If a thing is true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic  asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word \\\"believe\\\", however. The weak sense means I am not sure. \\\"I believe Tom went to  the library.\\\" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense means I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. \\\"I believe  that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.\\\" (despite  the fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian belief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological  topics.)    Note that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the  majority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that if Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be false, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity.  (And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)    It is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless  they have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks and wants.   Most Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living tradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly by the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.   If depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we  may both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive that he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.    Thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being  can find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find  absolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who does not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.   Here I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the knowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass  is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half full: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist and the optimist express the *same* fact.)   It is, of course, quite true that different people may express the  same belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail to understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great scisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal agreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs are equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict some other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have been stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must, **necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical to say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct,  but if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long as we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other  as in error.\",\" PC Magazine, January 12, 1993 had a review of several personal finance management programe, as did PC-Computing, January 1993.  PC World, December 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money. I can email you copies of these articles if you can't find them at your library.  I've been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have several friends who use Quicken, though I've not used it myself.  My overall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager while Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your finances.  Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:   The ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:  checking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile  your account statements with the records the program keeps.   The ability to make a budget and track your spending against that  budget.   A Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill  paying service to pay your bills via your modem.    The ability to print checks on your printer.   The ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.   The ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts  up to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically  via modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I'm not sure about it.   The ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation  programs.   Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that Quicken does not:   A tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to  predict your tax liability for the coming year.  It's usefull to fine  tune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn't get his due too early.   An insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep  records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.  It can also compute your life expectancy.   A financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest,   effects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to  maturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and  loan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you   decide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford  a particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good  investment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether  a particular investment's cash flow is adequate for your situation.  This module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping  your kids with their tuition.     A net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets  and liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this   information.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules  are automatically included here.   A \\\"desk\\\" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file  you can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital  information about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a  rudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment  list, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to  track such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list  can be made to display automatically when you start the program.  There are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I'm almost sure that Quicken doesn't do everything I've listed.  If I'm wrong, I'm sure hordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.  One thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a  Windows version.  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version of Managing Your Money for release late this year.\",\"As I've mentioned in the rules posting, I will be out of town until the day before the entry deadline, so I won't be able to respond to your messages until April 18.

I was picked from my softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand, left eye) which put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  To control the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  Since I was used to slow pitch, I didn't come close (actually I think I foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of people like me in her study (i.e., those who can't hit fast pitch, or are not used to hitting off a machine),  I would seriously question the results of that study!!  I think there have been some studies of major league players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was \\\"better\\\" - but I don't know the results.  (The woman who ran the study I was in said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major leaguers than across the general population - but I'm not sure whether I'd believe

[...]   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips  N, a 30-bit serial number  U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted    with the chip  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then  fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:        E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and      E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    Three questions: 1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output:   E[M;K] = 64 bits   E[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits   E[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits    Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,    or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?       All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications    like cellular phones (or even regular phones over   2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?    Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,    or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only    transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into    everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?  3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself?    Does the block have to be present at all?    Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,    it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's     limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,    and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness    (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets    it recognize a valid E[K;U].)        In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT    wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?    (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.)    Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;    paranoid people can use someone else's serial number.     On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,    presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,    like use message encryption that's really E[M; K,U,N] ?    Thanks!\",\"Hi.  My last question for the year.  I have a mail-order no-name notebook with 4 meg ram.  I never have problems with my huge ramdisk or when running desqview, but Win3.1 and W4W2.0 constantly crash on me, most commonly citing a \\\"memory parity error.\\\"  The only thing I can do is TURN OFF and re-boot.  My CMOS ticks off & counts all the memory every startup, and there is never a problem with this either.  Could it be a bug in my Windows copy instead of the hardware?  I remember having some disk error problems when installing it.   Is there any change I could make to lessen the frequency or likelyhood of this happening (I think win vs win /s produce different crashes, but both crash frequently nonetheless)\",\"--------- Forwarding begins here ---------  Date: Wed,  7 Apr 1993 15:39:55 -0400 (EDT) From: Women's Center <women+@andrew.cmu.edu> To: +dist+/afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr0/women/dlists/happyhour-announce.dl@andrew.cmu.edu Subject: PROGRESSIVES HAPPY HOUR  Enjoy good food and interesting company at the Progressives Happy Hour, Thursday 8 April, starting at 5:30pm at the Women's Center (located next to the laundromat in the Margaret Morrison Plaza).

Something atypical of the net, but here it goes.         Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr. King.  From many of the newspaper, radio, and tv news reports I have seen, this adjective       is commonly in front of his name.  I have NEVER seen anyone complain about the use of this adjective when used in a benign manner.  I did not say that Mr. King was a no good black!  I do not know Mr. King and would not make this ascertian without some evidence to this effect.  I used it PURELY as a  descriptive adjective in the same manner than many ( most ) news people have used it in the past.         The entire second trial was about race, Ted.  I don't feel compelled to discuss Mr. King's racial background, but had Mr. King been white there would not have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating would not have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult call to make.  It is possible the case, but not definately.          I still think your actions are crap, Ted.  They are far more divisive than me using the adjective 'black' in a non-derogenory manner.  Would you have been happier if I had used 'African-american' ?  If so, then you really are lost in the world of PC.

As I mentioned in the Tradition # cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory # about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the \\\"evil\\\" # which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as \\\"satanic.\\\"       Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is      metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not      the same way?  # The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane # in human language is something like describing \\\"color\\\" to a person # who has been blind from birth.  You may want to read the book # FLATLAND (if you haven't already) or THE DRAGON'S EGG.  The first # is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con- # cept...  [some deleted for space saving]  # When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe # another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then # such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be # necessary.  The \\\"unseen\\\" is described in terms which have reference` # and meaning for the reader/listener.  But, like all models, a compro- # mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness # of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all # crippled.  But what else can you do?       This is why I asked the above.  How would you then      know God exists as a spirit or being rather than      just being metaphorical?  I mean, it's okay to say      \\\"well, Satan is just metaphorical,\\\" but then you      have to justify this belief AND justify that God is      not some metaphor for something else.       I say this because there are many, many instances of      Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in       the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the      New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is      described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know      one is metaphorical and not the other.       Further, belief in God isn't a bar to evil.  Let's      consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were      metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe      in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a       case where someone does believe in God, but by      religious standards, they are \\\"evil.\\\"  If Bobby      does see this, let him address this question also.

Born 1959    Teacher    Sumgait Secondary School No. 10    Secretary of the Komsomol Organization at School No. 10    Member of the Sumgait City Komsomol Committee Office     Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15    Microdistrict No. 3    Sumgait [Azerbaijan]  [Note: The events in Kafan, used as a pretext to attack Armenians in   Azerbaijan are false, as verified by independent International Human Rights  organizations - DD]  I'm thinking about the price the Sumgait Armenians paid to be living in Armenia now. We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the price was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide our lives into \\\"before\\\" and ''after.\\\" We talk like that: that was before the war. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole epoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live, it will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even  sharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now . . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that happened.  Nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and  those who didn't.  That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you  could already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was near and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as my parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children.  My parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought that they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.  In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the afternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all our family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel like it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our  apartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in  his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely  locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a  hospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people  who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends of many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.  My parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my  mother, \\\"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\\\" But Mother was detached, pale, as  though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never  expected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A  girlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said,  \\\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out  of the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment.\\\"  We went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl  crawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that  perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside  me. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to embrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina  was thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to  say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout.  There was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from excited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time Karina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back, but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us  immediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at  least so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their  eyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst in, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They  came into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other  room. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma  snatched the axe from behind and said, \\\"Tell them not to touch the children.  Tell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\\\" She said this to Father in Armenian.  There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They  understood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian,  they don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \\\"You and  your children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your  children that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls,  our mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\\\" and  so on and so forth, \\\"and we came to do the same thing to you.\\\" This whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They  were mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people  among them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town,  all the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm  a teacher.  So they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took  him in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there, because he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all  but a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were  doing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off  Mamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \\\"I'm old enough to  be your mother! What are you doing?!\\\" He struck her. Now he's being held,  Mamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina,  who's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying  to lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their  consciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they  mustn't do it. She said, \\\"Come on, let's straighten this out, without  emotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we  ever do to you?\\\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come  into our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and  coming--said, \\\"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We  came here to kill them.\\\"  They pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she  didn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \\\"What did we do to you? What did we do to you?\\\" And even later, when she came to,  she said, \\\"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\\\"  That group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only  broke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they  were beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain  nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do  was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they did to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off,  they beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but  didn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they  could to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists,  kicking her, using anything they could find.  Mamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain,  just didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they  did. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the apartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the  corners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \\\"Let's take her  outside.\\\"  Those beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they  weren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time  I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't  afraid of what would happen to them.  When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered  with blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several  times from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though  I were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm  vengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold  a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time  I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them,  and I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me  \\\"forget,\\\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.  At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and  despite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had to do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering  to an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that he's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me and took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over me. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that they planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up with their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a  really deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I  suddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly  I felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I  just imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the  ground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was  still lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all, they became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with their feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe- cially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.  I came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it.  Some people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't  need any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had  even forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth  living.  There was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman  pain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come  because I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself,  and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to put an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The  person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well,  because he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he  has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person,  one who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see,  even during the investigation he almost called me \\\"daughter,\\\" he apologized,  although, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that  I can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my  words, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes, but then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never  forget it.  I wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one  could protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of  beasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything. I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.  And Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to  kill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an  end to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into  the other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it  was, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was  thrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her  and made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all  the deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor  from the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a  little. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku, how we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said,  \\\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes, I, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\\\" he says, \\\"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and  think I never shall again.\\\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw  everything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken  the father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He  saw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven people. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the  brothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that  they were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to  do something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I  After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and  Lyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even  remember my sister's name. I wanted to cry \\\"Marina!\\\" out to her, but could not. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus I saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both there by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell  right away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad  that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . .  although her spirit was murdered . . .  At some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that  mob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his  name, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \\\"Igor, help!\\\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were  taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and  Lyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the  neighbors.  And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment,  something like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.   Then they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one,  they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out  onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already  sure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone  said, \\\"She's already dead, let's throw her out.\\\" When they carried me out onto the balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I  heard someone say in Azerbaijani: \\\"Don't kill her, I know her, she's a  teacher.\\\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't remember whose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an  accent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks Azerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and  I having opened my  eyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had  been beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only  remember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately  I can't remember anything more.  What should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot  about him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too much. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that  women usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan, if he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated very sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in  Ufa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that  all out later.  Among the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary  of the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is  Najaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure, she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she  didn't want to endanger him. She said, \\\"He was there,\\\" and a little while  later, \\\"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else.  No, it seems like it was he.\\\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see  us the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something  entirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to see us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought  groceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started  crying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting  us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned  him to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait.  The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is  right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the  investigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone  to Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility.  Ill now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she  bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her  wedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's  lives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A  Russian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised by his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a  special school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm  a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that boy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine,  and analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too.  After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.  He beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \\\"Lady, if you give us all the gold  and money in your apartment we'll let you live.\\\" And Mamma told them where  the gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and  everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other  over and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one  another right then.  Mamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was black and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she  ran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil- low. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead,  halfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see,  and was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth,  it was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.  The bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father  out of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room, a small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people  were standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants,  everywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee service--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \\\"I was afraid  to turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the  threshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and  dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'.\\\" Mamma remembered one of the  criminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her,  out of one eye. She says, \\\"I realized that my death would come from that  person. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\\\" Later they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.  I was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina  was already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all alone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and Lyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out. I went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another.  But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones  I had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the  ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and  that all of that would die with me.  At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I  didn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that we were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \\\"Neighbor, is that you?\\\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived I would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been  taken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to  take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he  started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room.  The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in  the air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the  presence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities  or not. He said, \\\"Enough, let's go to the third entryway.\\\" In the third  entryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once  again that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as  they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they  found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had  already taken the other.  Four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They had to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over those 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I  identified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an  Azerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian: \\\"Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\\\" That's just what he said, \\\"those Azerbaijanis,\\\" as though he himself were not  Azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \\\"I'll drive them out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails and nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41.\\\"  That's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the  person in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened  to, the \\\"general,\\\" said that they were going to the third entryway.  Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself.  Marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer.  He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut.  But the door was lying on the floor in the hall.  I went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt  from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find  anything. He told me, \\\"Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the  neighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're  alive.\\\" He told me all this in Armenian.  Then he returned to the others and said, \\\"What are you waiting for? Leave!\\\"  They said, \\\"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her  yourself. No, we want to do it to.\\\" He urged them on, but gently, not  coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just boys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went down to the third floor with them himself, and said, \\\"Leave. What's the mat- ter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\\\" And he came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that  he couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I  told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really good terms with them.  We knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman  opened the door and immediately said, \\\"I'm an Azerbaijani.\\\" He said, \\\"I know.  Let her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows about this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\\\" She says, \\\"Fine, have her come in.\\\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I  had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into  tears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a  half-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \\\"Do you know where my family  is, what happened to them?\\\" She says, \\\"No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid  to go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see  who's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian.\\\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my  neighbor says, \\\"You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you,  or my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\\\" During the butchery in our apartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl earrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was  still there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I  touched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it to her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.  I went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I  don't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I  end up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the  apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor.  I had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had  hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near  some broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing.  Then they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I  think that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were broken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay  there without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town  could hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were  burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started picking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport  jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the one end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out.  And again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to  strangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on  my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me afterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got  burned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was protecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know  how. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if  I found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I  had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on  living without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I  thought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her.  I tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in  Afghanistan, he should protect her.  While I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I thought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would  she live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among  themselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter.  Another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good  job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was  all over. They started to argue. A third one says, \\\"How come you get it? I  have four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need.  All these years I've been living in God-awful places.\\\" Another one says,  \\\"Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave.\\\" Then someone said  that Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their place. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and left.  Oh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite  frequently, \\\"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let  them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\\\" Then they  said, \\\"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\\\" They repeated it  very often.         - - - reference for #008 - - -  [1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,     Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by     Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Hentrich        baba@Tymnet.Com -    I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling himself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first in the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal term but may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotations are quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the eightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar Max Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the Nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is synonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who originally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans and possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word by Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is nontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claim to call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor- shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.    If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``In search of the Indo-Europeans\\\" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica. The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and for Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible things done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have no clear claim.\",\"   Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else, one can get too much of a good thing.   Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries, essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her, necessarily.    Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected.     These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.    People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that \\\"pisses off\\\" their body. Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard, causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it.    See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly.  and brain damage.   The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin, and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.   poisoning.   Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating , say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home, plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of things.  But it might be the MSG.    If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.   Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.\",\" As one of the \\\"Clintonites\\\" cited above, I'll try to clarify since this is not a case of Clinton's \\\"dishonesty.\\\" (I won't necessarily defend him on other issues.)    There were NEVER any specific projects included in the Community Development Block Grant portion of the President's proposal.  Congressional Republicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what they felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL  projects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus package was ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the White House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted to Congress.  It didn't work.)  The $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close to covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it were passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and at what level.  In the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one ever expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the  Republicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS PACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total  amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus  package for ALL projects.    The plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are places where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing priorities.  If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects that will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton administration has been publicizing the issue.  A final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is worth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to them is new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally  supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending, arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending priorities than \\\"Washington bureaucrats.\\\"    Is it clear now?

The real fear comes from them doing more than this.  This is a voluntary program, and thus harder for us to object to on the surface.  Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one.  They are pushing to get a standard in place, a secret standard, and if they get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market. It will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't have registered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan for most phone companies.  You see, with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to any cellular company, or other phones or ports because they will follow the standard.  AT&T has already announced a clipper chip encryption product.  The government has marketed hard to get major vendors to use these chips.   If they get enough market share, they will rule.  And thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be tapped by the police.  The public isn't that concerned about it now, after all.  They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listen to today!  They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure them only from the police.  Well, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work with other proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phones expensive.  Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them cheap, only the Mob will buy them.  And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of better encryption phones, because \\\"the only reason a person would want one is to evade the police.\\\"  Interesting.\",\"  Wow.

I can't imagine how to estimate bat speed, but its pretty obvious that Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit, likely due to his back.    I don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the A's, and had no problems with it then. It might be that pre-back problems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're cold, its a hitch.    The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable with for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses track of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was  clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because he's changed his stance so much.  I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting all the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw himself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco's famous batting practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged bad hitting habits.   \",\"Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for Windows 3.1.  I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia's MS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some sites in the U.S.  The three I found were:  1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)                                 This was the smallest and simplest    of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.    It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra    button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the    title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press    a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would    have been nice if there was an \\\"ALWAYS ON TOP\\\" setting for the little    window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified    strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be    a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace    manager makes it an attractive package.  2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)                                While this workspace manager offered a    few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming    to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace    is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take \\\"snapshots\\\"    of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what     applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,    but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.    With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in    a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this    viewing functionality which is quite useful.  3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)                             This is an interesting package, which contains    a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies    include \\\"Backmenu\\\", which provides a pop-up root menu when you    press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu    is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,    which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could    say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also    bundled in \\\"backdesk.zip\\\" is a program called \\\"WRUN\\\", which allows    you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS    instead of using the File Manager to run applications.      The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite    differently to the other two workspace managers in that it    doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.    In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,    and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to    focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different    viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which    each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window    allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically    the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area    while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up    of a particular section.\",\" I am no expert on this.

Yep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the #1 spot.  It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.    Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean. --  Dale J.

I don't know what a \\\"low grade\\\" fusion reactor is, but the major problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some fractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith would have to be processed.  This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn't content with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust, average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound. This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.  On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; \\\"high-Ti\\\" basalts (Apollo 11 and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but... terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in titanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and sometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are *enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the world (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If even 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2 at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being mined today).\",\"// Hope I am in the right group!

[]  Define \\\"armed better\\\". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to 3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).  A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.  - A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull   the trigger again. - A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,   but will fire merely by pulling the trigger. - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again   to rotate to the next round. - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an   easy motion, even one handed. - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.  - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell   first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often   lost as you realize \\\"hey, it's jammed!\\\" before starting to do anything   about clearing it. - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round   and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the    chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider   this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed   of employment as a revolver. - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of   operation of many of them requires more training.  Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having accidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks require rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a VCR.  Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay attention. I do not seek here to say \\\"semi-autos are junk\\\" merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot.  Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a  wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything. Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit. I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit what I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously wrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than 5.  What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple .38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police  prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....  ObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they          introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking         as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal. \",\"day    Brent shows his ignorance once again.

Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats) will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed.  Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from key escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.  Because life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal very large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assume that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous property (a cipher cellular phone).  Just as we have seen in the past with \\\"blue box\\\" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones, we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakes criminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen instruments.  Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days, a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.  There will be a continuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.  In other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, and persistent threat to the general public.  On the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a device in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at least stand out as being unusual, and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation.  Finally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments, there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications in the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered, and the instruments involved have been identified).  While recording and archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks, it is probably feasible across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks.  The existence of these recordings could open up vast potential for abuse.\",\"=I think that's the correct spelling.. = I am looking for any information/supplies that will allow =do-it-yourselfers to take Krillean Pictures.

That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.   Excellent point.  Perhaps you aren't so naive after all?   Taken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's make it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been taken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.   In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though, were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or were they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just registering the shotgun?   \\\"Come on down to honest Erik's Used Swords!

You guys still slicing each other with long knives, or is this really not a problem?   I'm all for that.  What gets me is that scandanavians (and yes, I'm only a couple generations off the longship) used to be some of the most feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago, yet now seem to spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing. Maybe you had a bit more time, and a more homogeneous culture, to become civilized with?   Yes.  We're too damned violent, partially I believe because we are not a homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as \\\"Americans\\\" first and foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage, whereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in your veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good. In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother tells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke \\\"low Dane,\\\" whereas others spoke \\\"high Dane.\\\"  It was shortly after World War II, as I remember, that \\\"low Dane\\\" was abolished so there was one common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem, because we have even more obvious means of identifying an \\\"outsider.\\\"   Take heart, yours is better than 90% of what gets posted by native speakers.

PDT                  Q   I had two questions for both Presidents, so you  could probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)              THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll  give you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)              Q   The first is that this is the meeting of the  Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government  money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the  government.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going  to be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian  businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What  are the priorities, because there are several association of  Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to  participate in setting up priorities for investment?                This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know  that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans  are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls  say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times  published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war;  42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent  if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to  sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not  very enthusiastic?  Thank you.              Q   I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going  to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the  answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.              THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is,  it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example,  the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will  obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be  good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will  be used to support the privatization of existing public  enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the  Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have  some influence over the distribution of.                With regard to your second question, let me say that  I would think that there would be people in both countries who  would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government  giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to  that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history  there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That  is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole  history of America, any kind of aid program has always been  unpopular.                What I have tried to tell the American people is, is  this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that  this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion -- trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments  because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in  Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them  working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies  going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it  possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the  economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and  investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce  nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on  our side and on the Russian side.                So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an  investment for the United States.  This is very much in the  interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the  second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next  week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for  the taxpayers and workers of my country.                Russia is a very great nation that needs some  partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share  her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view  this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not  what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful  investment.                Like all investments, there is some risk.  But  there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than  the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier  of the Cold War.              Q   Mr. President, first of all thank you very  much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory  of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American  President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind  of a very measured breakthrough.                I have two questions.  One, in your introductory  remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief  that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you  tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to  what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification  of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how  confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager  to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions  inherited from the Cold War?                PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of  Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with  regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent  states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States  develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing  that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of  the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude  our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that  would provide not only an important economic opportunity for  Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out  on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed  off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and  we agreed to continue to press that.              I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to  reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the  Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the  United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine,  but that, in order to do what we need to do together to  strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States  be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join  the NPT regime is critical.              What was the second question?                THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and  COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the  Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will,  as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other  restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on  relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies  of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of  them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the  leadership of the Congress.              With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be  an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there  are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to  emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there  is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed  to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be  much less.              With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing  more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my  own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement  out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to  begin it in the fairly near future.              Q   Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in  Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely  different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not  political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of  Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the  difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the  difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of  Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the  last part of your speech?              THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to  compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say  what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a  boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the  music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been  thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music  for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists  and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know  as much as I could about your history.                And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then  the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last  presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone  in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr.  Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I  was following events there very closely and hoping for the day  when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a  personal feeling about Russia.                I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like  music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a  musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York  Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony  to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly  than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically  so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it  occurred.                These are things that have always had a big impact  on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever  had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two  countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)              THE PRESS:  Thank you.\",\" The problem with \\\"Let's assume\\\" reasoning is that, taken to the extreme (and you're close), you arrive at \\\"Let's assume this is perfectly OK.\\\"  The assumptions you make are big ones. If the system is really secure, then why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?  There are plenty of encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure, so why in the world use one that does?  There are reasons, of course, but I certainly can't think of any honest ones.  Next, you assume we can \\\"trust\\\" the escrow houses. But the last time I checked, EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure, corruption, and even fabrication, of supposedly secure data. The govt is saying \\\"Yeah, but NOW we're serious, so you can trust us.\\\"  Bullcrypt.   And finally, although you didn't state it explicitly, you implicitly assume that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. The case in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this score.  Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers, right?  As others have pointed out, the current proposal will, if deployed, render truly secure encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sam's brand. Who will be able to afford, and be sufficiently motivated, to purchase this expensive, inconvenient higher protection?  Somebody with lots of extra cash...

The long answer is yes - but a few have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unix's are the same, you know! As far as \\\"many bugs\\\" go, it would probably be more useful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-)  Platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: RS6000, Dec Ultrix Sun Solaris so it is possible.  The main problem is that I don't have access to other platforms than the RS6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way I hear about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to how to fix it.  As far as the software not doing anything, do you really think I would bother releasing it, if that was the case? Perhaps you didn't read the few docs that ARE supplied. The dogfight world is made up of clients only, so if you're in there on your own, then you're not going to see anything! The dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary - so if you don't see anything there, then this is definitely a problem!  One final word - if you're not interested, don't bother with it. If you are interested, then please remember that I'm not asking for any money! So why not try a little patience and constructive criticism, maybe that will get results??\",\" Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that...I sounds to me, your UPS takes in AC, rectifies it to DC to charge the batteries, and then takes the battery DC and chops it to AC again, feeding your equipment.  This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since, as you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.  Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you lose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to replace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time and you've got to resync the AC in no time flat.  Unfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption that AC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to be usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.  Similar story with our telephone system.  It was first invented back in the 1800's.  We're still using the same damn system (media) as they did back then.  If I have a phone from back then, I can assure you it'll work on today's phone system.  It costs too much to overhaul everyone to a new system, so they make it work with what is out there.\",\"[A lot of this article has been deleted for space.] \",\" Probably within 50 years, it will be possible to disassemble and re-assemble our bodies at the molecular level.  Not only will flawless cosmetic surgery be possible, but flawless cosmetic PSYCHOSURGERY.

The threat is not from bad genes, but bad memes!  Memes are the basic units of culture, as opposed to genes which are the units of genetics.  We stand on the brink of new meme-amplification technologies!  Harmful memes which formerly were restricted in their destructive power will run rampant over the countryside, laying waste to the real benefits that future technology has to offer.  For example, Jeremy Rifkin has been busy trying to whip up emotions against the new genetically engineered tomatoes under development at CALGENE.  This guy is inventing harmful memes, a virtual memetic Typhoid Mary.\",\"  Yep.  There's truth in all those religions, even in science.    Christianity doesn't claim to know it all.

Check out a medical supply catalog, the thing you are looking for is called a woods lamp (so you can check for woods sign, certain skin conditions flourecse (sp) under UV light)  They come in disposable penlight like types and larger ac powered types.  It is also used in eye examinations, a flourescent dye is introduced to the surface of the eye, then UV is shined on it, shows up scratches and abrasions very clearly that would otherwise be very difficult to detect.  (for the completest the dye is called flouescien, and in normal light appears orangish, and leaves a mild burning sensation to the eye for 10-15 minutes, until the tears flush it all out.

Do an intersection calculation in the plane in 2D, where you're guaranteed a unique solution (unless they're parallel which won't happen in this case), and then use parametric distance along the lines from the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest.  This bypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in 3d.  Hope I haven't put my foot in it again!  steve ---\",\"  You'll probably get one when you realize that your $100 vesa super dooper local bus ultra high tech controller sucks...

Here Here....    don't stick your foot in your mouth when you make a statement you know nothing about.   I'd rather wait a second compared to the 5 minutes and ide would take. (obviously exaggerated).  Have you ever tried to backup 2 gigs of disk?  Oh I forgot you can't because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.   I guess you probably bought a 486sx too   What?  The SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE spec has much more bandwidth than any stupid vlbus ide crap....  Stop this thread now, Its just cluttering up bandwidth.  If you want to read about scsi vs ide just pay a visit to you local usenet archive.  the best SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE,etc is clearly faster than any the best ide drive. All the response given are based upon personal experience with 1 or 2 drives.  You can't judge such completely different interfaces.   IDE has the low cost adavantage + a descent performance. SCSI has the ability for super high capacity expandibility and speed.  neither one is better in all cases.

looking for a program that will let me use a windows common dialog box to select a file to use when running a DOS app.   Basically, I have several DOS apps that I use now and then with different files.  They all accept a file as a command line  parameter, but the only way (at least that I know of) to do this easily when running them from windows is to set up the PIF file so that it prompts me for additional parameters (at which point I type  in the file name).    Problems are:   1) Sometimes I can't remember where the file is exactly located and it would be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the file manager.       and 2) I'm lazy and hate to type long pathnames for files burried  several directory levels deep.   If anyone can point me to such a program or let me know of some other way to handle this, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks,  Tim --   The Net isn't organized enough to be considered an anarchy\",\"   While I can't think of any Corvettes with side mounted backup lights, I know that Saab started using them about 15 years ago.  My 1975 Saab 99 didn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In addition to the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another set integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who don't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic growth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out of the front fender, which incorporated amber \\\"parking lights\\\", amber side marker lights/reflectors, white \\\"cornering lamps\\\" (like American luxury cars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators on, and white \\\"backup lights\\\" aimed towards the back of the car when you have selected reverse gear.  The glossy brochure showed how these front mounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards (pot holes, kid's toys, etc) that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the wheels turned while backing up.\",\"  Interesting discussion.  I limit myself to *one* 'standard serving' of alcohol if I'm going to ride. And mostly, unless the alcohol is something special (fine ale, good wine, or someone else's vsop), I usually just don't drink *any*.  But then alcohol just isn't really important to me, mainly for financial reasons...  At least one of the magazines claims to follow the aviation guideline of \\\"no alcohol whatsoever\\\" within 24hrs of riding a 'company' bike.

Good.   I would hope so.  Let's define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon whose majority of energy comes from fission and/or fusion of atomic nuclei.  Let's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses  in such state, quantity, and with such a vector that they could cause  death or serious disease [further defined] to a significant number of people if released in a city, similarly populated area, resevoir, or cropland.     Nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined.  Other poisonous gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there is no use not related to weaponry.  Licenses should be available for research purposes on such chemicals.  I am not a lawyer, but these ideas could certainly be a basis for  definitions.   Nope.  It is not considered a weapon.   It is not defined as a weapon of mass destruction.  Many things are banned for other reasons.   \",\" : In any case, I think Viola would have made a better signing.  Why? : Viola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does : Toronto have?  Well, I agree that Viola is a better signing.  However, why does everyone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthanded spot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters than lefthanded batters.  I just don't understand why people insist on lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium). Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters. I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams may be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probably only a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters for this reason during the regular season.  I think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of whether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to have higher ERA's than righthanded starters, precisely because managers go out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of the platoon advantage).

The good drivers now pay through the nose to spread the cost of the crappy drivers' actions, and that's not fair.   Any plan that caps rates for crappy drivers is inherently a piece of shit, because the rest of us end up paying more.   Any plan that uses speeding tickets as a basis for raising rates is also a piece of shit as it is based upon the lie that faster drivers are inherently less safe than slower drivers, and the NHTSA disproved that two years ago now.

I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is essentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civil liberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get involved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good reason.  When I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a security point of view, but wouldn't tell us how to fix it.  I always figured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix the problem.  Then I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason. Auditors don't like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The auditee can say, \\\"Well, you told us this way would be OK.\\\"  It compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's job.  Taking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar. Suppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU's part, a key half gets away that shouldn't, and is used to deprive someone of her civil liberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court. But they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant and of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.  There are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one place where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum was kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and was brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.  I believe the difference between this situation and the key registration situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll checks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again today, he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can be destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are legit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could put the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU conflict of interest.  As always, my opinions are my own.\",\"tes:   A friend of mine who smoke pot every day and last Tuesday took 5 hits of acid  is still having trouble \\\"aiming\\\" for the bowl when he takes a dump.

By the 1920s, there was a very active \\\"good roads\\\" movement, which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so, and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco \\\"America on the Road\\\" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called \\\"The Devil Wagon in God's Country\\\" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or John Bell Rae's auto histories.  As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel.

Clearly, occupation is an    undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate.   Ok, let me re-phrase the question. I have repeatedly asked you if the  Israelis have less human rights than the palestinians, and if so, why.

Re: your statement of  occupation: I'd like you to define the term, so I don't have to repeat this 'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary.

Is it distressing Brendan?  The point is that any eugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacks of pure Nazism.  The fact that Elias' proposal cast the entire \\\"problem\\\" as one of the abnormal presence of Israeli society in the Middle East, and that he buried a slam against U.S. aid to Israel in the midst of his \\\"even-handed\\\" solution of the Jewish Question, made it obvious what  he had in mind: disolving the Jewish polity.  That *is* a Nazi doctrine: rectification of the \\\"abnormal presence\\\" of the Jewish people within a  larger body politic.  Whether your \\\"solution\\\" involves gas, monetary  incentives to the poor Jews to marry out, or as Feisal Husseini has  said, \\\"disolve the Zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal  surrounding Arab culture,\\\" you are engaged in a Nazi project.

I am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense. You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this  compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless  to me.  I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't  stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me  sad and sick.   Have you ever heard of Jonestown? The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority  worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these  people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot  more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as  last year.

I remember driving 700-800 miles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I   would have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles. No problems with winds and curves.   Then there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where we were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.  b) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see no difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip back from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind you, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better than the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still get 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.    Now now, you can't compare a diesel with a gasoline engine. I see enough bmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have 100-150k miles on them and advertise  rebuilt engines. If honda was to build an accord for 30k, I'd darn well expect the sucker to last 300k miles.   Ever got caught behind a early 80's 300SDL at a stop light? It's not pleasant. The newer MB's are a lot better though. The diesel Volvos and VWs are probably the smelliest offenders.  As for economy, why should we care? Gas is cheap!

Then he goes on the make statements which make me shudder.  He has established a two-tiered God.  One set of rules for the Jews (his people) and another set for the saved Gentiles (his people).  Why would God discriminate?  Does the Jew who accepts Jesus now have to live under the Gentile rules.  God has one set of rules for all his people.  Paul was never against the law.  In fact he says repeatedly that faith establishes rather that annuls the law.  Paul's point is germane to both Jews and Greeks.  The Law can never be used as an instrument of salvation.  And please do not combine the ceremonial and moral laws in one.  In Matt 5:14-19 Christ plainly says what He came to do and you say He was only saying that for the Jews's benefit.

What exactly did I claim?      --------------------------------------------------     \\\"I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns   to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.\\\"      --------------------------------------------------        I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're   paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own   eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps   people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,   \\\"bullshit filters\\\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.    Later in the same post:      Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building   were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and   am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.  Fine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are \\\"inclined\\\" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those claims are still ludicrous, however.  Previously Awesley had written:   You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.  Prompting me to write:   To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion   grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be   perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since   it makes your other claim seem more plausible.  To which Awesley replied:   John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you   have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said   nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you   need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a   while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.  But why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the notion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion because it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But that too is ludicrous.    If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been   screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about   it.   Awesley relied:      Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an   authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it   had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an   authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged   massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.   Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but   the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \\\"several\\\".  I've also   heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd   assert that I claimed they were truth.  Yes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have.  Army tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's without it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on it and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying \\\"this has gone far enough.\\\"  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis for my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it.  Not one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and everybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it had happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own research failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is extraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not.  Unless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I do not.    Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.        Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the    difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26    years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.   So it would have been an Army cover-up.  Quibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has taught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half decades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said \\\"yes, I shelled Americans,\\\" or \\\"I gave the orders to fire the cannons,\\\" or \\\"I helped cover it up\\\"?    If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer   to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that   those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.  Awesley replied:     Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe   that they did fire their guns.  Good.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did.  Your belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known?  Awesley concludes:      Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read   this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the   account I cited.  Actually, now we have established that I don't believe what you believe, as well as why I don't believe it.  And if it's boring, then I yield the last word to you, if you want it.  You may say anything you like with impunity--I am dropping the subject.\",\"A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView. Since he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post it for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:  CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most annoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to do with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its \\\"current directory\\\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell) when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView doesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems  to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \\\"dithering\\\", again writing another file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this second file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does the last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to your screen again.  (It does this last \\\"recopy\\\" operation for its \\\"fit to screen\\\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)   The result of this process is the following:         1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all         you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of         data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never         realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.       2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for         the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the         dithering and writes to the screen card.         However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data         from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)         one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which         there was room on the disk.  This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general idea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details about file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient disk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be very large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess of 6 Meg free disk space.   CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from a floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the floppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT table? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly unrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files menu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing? \",\"HI All, Can someone point me towards some articles on 'boids' or flocking algorithms... ?

I have used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resource converter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially the naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets. With windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance, this doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK, and Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So  your constructor should know how to convert a #define into the proper resource identifier. I'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does use resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to port to.

I  felt for the money my NEC 5FG that I use at work was a much better monitor. The NEC is sharper, flatter, less distorted, and more stable.  I have heard  complaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control  problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.  There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not  match up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the  frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that  the NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter  and the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable  pincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness  when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the  controls.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the  raster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome  as the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.  I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold  through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that  way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has  my vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if  it's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to  buy.

(if you are familiar with Insight, you know the kit I mean).  I believe the drive is either a Texel (265ms) or an NEC (280ms), but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the bundle (at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight answer as to which one; ah, yes, one of the drawbacks of OEM!).  Other questions:  - Excuse my ignorance, but is \\\"Texel\\\" a reputable maker in the CD-ROM   market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive?  - Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?  (Currently, $449 for the   TA-1000, and $699 for the TA-2000)  Alternatively, I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my uses (however, I *do* want full multimedia capabilities, Photo CD stuff, educational programs for my kids, etc.), and considered the lower-end TA-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something else useful, like a tape back-up drive unit.  Basically, I would just like to hear from those who have actually USED these kits, and whatever pros/cons you might advise, preferably directly to the email address below.

What is probably the most convincing is the anti-Christian literature put out by the Jewish councils in the second century.  There are enormous quantities of detailed arguments against Christianity, many of the arguments still being used today.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity, not one denies the existance of Jesus, only of his activities.    I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of the gospels (especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as a source).\",\" Good question; I don't know what the law considers them.

I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court. Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record calls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants and listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this strategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not in the near term.)  In other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence inadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to interpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprised that archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything but analogous to a wiretap by the courts.  Note that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technically feasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without warrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future, start surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause, decrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation gets a boost from data that, sadly, won't ever be presented to a jury.  While I'm posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this archiving scenario to extremes, read \\\"Lacey and his Friends\\\", a collection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the slippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don't worry folks, it's stored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can get to it.  And by the way, we'll be installing cameras on all major streets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and teller machines, don't we?  And then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public places.  Then in some private places.  Then we'll make it a crime ever to be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy cubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and after.  But, see, there's still a right to privacy.  We haven't curtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it'd be to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a VR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.  And hey, nobody'll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.  After all, if you're not doing anything illegal...  Funny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became pretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn't elminate all crime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds of national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their execs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of competition.  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system.   I can't imagine why. \",\"  Good question.  I'm sure some biologist could answer better than I, but animals brains are just set up differently.

In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health insurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like socialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary insurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward. With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.  That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund is to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back in Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \\\"libertarian\\\" faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these).  I'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about leftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian newsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100% insurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know it, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American conservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who seriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about the Americans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans who spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that shouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for insurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that the Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite being open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to spend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a different culture.   \\\"Managed Care\\\" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most western nations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France and Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says of HMO/NHS approaches, \\\"We left that behind with East Germany!\\\"). Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling doctors with budget strings.  In Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France and Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public hospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisions are different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked \\\"sickness funds\\\" over a century old while Canada divides by their provinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the doctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)  With such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to the U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The French and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations in more compact geography to improve scales of economy.  gld\",\"I have the following Genesis/Megadrive games for sale or trade for other Genesis/MD (or SNES games).

This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED    with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K    colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB    VRAM.  2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:     a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an       Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often       remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to       be.     b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the       display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you       shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).  3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development    Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger    icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the    debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed    to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The    Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.     Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen    is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter    \\\"R\\\". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it    does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this.     The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive    behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with    Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles    the VGA mode.        The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use    another monitor in place of my usual one.

About 20 years ago, _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips  in them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called \\\"Son o' God\\\" comics.  It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic, there were a  group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn, and when one of them said  the magic word, he turned into \\\"Son o' God.\\\" He went from a myopic,  curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied  portraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile  features.    Now, if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus,  and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this  NatLamp Jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since  this Jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.   This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim  that they are Christian. They profess faith in Jesus, but the Jesus  that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the  NatLamp Jesus was. \",\"Hi everyone.

By all means, if you do kick the dog or otherwise get its attention, STOP and STAY there. If you kick the dog and ride away, that is a victory for the dog -- it drove you out of its territory.

If a *marked* edge is discovered to be inconsistent, then you lose.  If step 1) finds more than one face sharing a particular edge, then you lose.

It is an S3 86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my second meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from them, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say \\\"Buy the memory from us\\\" or something like that.)

If we are going to get anywhere in  this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never  addressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is  \\\"right\\\" or who is \\\"wrong\\\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover  and that, having been placed \\\"in between\\\" the Israelis and the guerillas, they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.    [The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms   is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that   civilians will not be thought of by the other side as  \\\"combatants\\\". So, what do you think is the \\\"meaning behind\\\",   the intention and the effect when an \\\"army\\\" purposely   *does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look   like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will   receive from this \\\"cover\\\" is more important that the harm  that will come to civilians.*  This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians in \\\"the middle\\\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians.   But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves  at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \\\"why set   ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made   cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of   view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept   some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.   I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND ineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait  until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that \\\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\\\" will do more to stop attacks.   As I said previously, Israel spent several decades \\\"sitting passively\\\" on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after* the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well. The \\\"host\\\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks  from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact  on the civilians caught in their path.    This is just another \\\"selectively applied\\\" statement.   The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.  That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for  the \\\"interim\\\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are demanding conditions that essentially define \\\"autonomy\\\" already. They DO NOT trust that Israel will \\\"follow through\\\" the entire process and allow Palestinians to reach full autonomy.   Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians?  If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians  be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words? Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up \\\"tangible assets  (land, control of areas) in exchange for \\\"words\\\". For this reason, they are also concerned about the sorts of \\\"guarantees\\\" they will have  that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.  Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the Israelis \\\"word\\\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being demanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party finally gets HOLD of this \\\"land\\\", what the \\\"other party\\\" does is totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land, your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to keeps its word does NOT get the land back.   While the \\\"major armaments\\\" (those allowing people to wage \\\"civil wars\\\") have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still remain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \\\"commando\\\" raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.   Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks were commonplace.   There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \\\"disarmed\\\" UNLESS the state is as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.  That's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to \\\"take over\\\" Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that. What both \\\"sides\\\" need is to receive something \\\"tangible\\\". The Arabs/ Palestinians are looking for \\\"land\\\" and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it gives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks\",\" I'm not sure about Juha, but another top center, Rauli Raitanen([ss{t) is drafted by Jets.

Richmond or Syracuse?  He was taken by the Jays in the Rule V draft, but not kept on the roster.  Baseball Weekly said that he was demoted to Syracuse, but a Toronto paper indicated that the Braves took him back.  Is there an Atlanta fan, or anyone reading this, who knows?   \",\" The \\\"so sacred it's secret\\\" explanation is a bit misleading.  While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.   There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).  Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \\\"You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you\\\" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.   But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few:  1. \\\"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given\\\" (Matt. 13:11).  2. \\\"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\\\" (Matt. 19:11).  3. \\\"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\\\" (John 16:12).  4. \\\"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father\\\" (John 16:25).  5. \\\"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\\\" (1 Cor. 3:1-2).  6. \\\"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face\\\" (2 Jn. 1:12).  (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.   Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------          Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City                     jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu\",\" Someone else said something similar.  I will not comment on the value or lack of value of Elias's \\\"proposal\\\".  I just want to say that it is very distressing that at least two people here are profoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine.  They were NOT like Elias's idea, they were more like the opposite.    Nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  An  instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to  Nazi theoreticians, Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted, and in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies were considered not pure Gypsies but \\\"mongrels\\\" formed from the pure Gypsy  race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between  the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies, by the way.  It is also  true that towards the end of WWII even the \\\"purist\\\" Gypsies were  hunted down as the theory was forgotten.\",\"  Since running any GUI over a network is going to slow it down by a fair amount, I expect Windows NT will be multiuser only in the sense of sharing filesystems. Someone will likely write a telnetd for it so one could run character-based apps, but graphics-based apps will have to be shared by running the executables on the local CPU. This is how things are shaping up everywhere: client-server architectures are taking over from the old cpu-terminal setups.

Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xt happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered,  the specification does not guarantee such a sequence, and supplemental  authoritative documents (i.e. the Asente/Swick volume) do say that the order is undefined.  Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.  In general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating  independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other callbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be  registered can explicitly call other functions necessary.  [4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?   XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not  actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?    It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback, which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer is set to one of the valid values. If it is not a \\\"yes\\\" answer, the code drops out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop:    void quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)  {   int             answer;   answer = AskUser(w, \\\"Really Quit?\\\");   if (RET_YES == answer)    {    answer = AskUser(w, \\\"Are You Really Positive?\\\");    if (RET_YES == answer)     exit(0);                 }  }   A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether  to overwrite it.  This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the calling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the  Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of  dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for \\\"OK\\\", \\\"Cancel\\\" and  \\\"Help\\\" or equivalents:    int AskUser(w, string)         Widget          w;         char           *string;   {         int             answer=RET_NONE; /* some not-used marker */         Widget          dialog;   /* could cache&carry, but ...*/         Arg             args[3];         int             n = 0;         XtAppContext    context;          n=0;         XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,                 XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;         XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;         dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);         XtManageChild(dialog);          context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);         while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {                 XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);         }         XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */         return answer;   }   The dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same  function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user  finally selects one of those choices:    void response(w, client, call)         Widget          w;         XtPointer client;         XtPointer call;   {   int *answer = (int *) client;   XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;         switch (reason->reason) {         case XmCR_OK:                 *answer = RET_YES; /* some #define value */                 break;         case XmCR_CANCEL:                 *answer = RET_NO;    break;         case XmCR_HELP:                 *answer = RET_HELP;                 break;         default:                 return;         } }  and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and continues from there.

If you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do  what you want. Note that it depends on the widget's internal data structures  and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt, including R4.   #include <X11/CoreP.h>  #include <X11/Xresource.h>  String XtName (widget)  Widget widget; /* WILL work with non-widget objects */  {  return XrmNameToString(widget->core.xrm_name);  }  [7/90; modified with suggestion by Larry Rogers (larry@boris.webo.dg.com) 9/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 125)  Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindow(widget)? I'm doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics within my Xt-based program:    The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the  realization of the widget.  Using a window id of NULL (\\\"no window\\\") could  create the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget()  before attempting to use the window associated with a widget.   Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call,  but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also  wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?  The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of  the screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can take the following steps to avoid the error:  1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture. 2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle. 3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap. 4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the image from the pixmap. 5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and  the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you  the parts of the pixmap which aren't good. 6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.

A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight character-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:    display = XOpenDisplay(display_name);  if (display)   { do X stuff }  else   { do curses or something else } where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following -display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case  XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].  This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line  argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is  adequate. [5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 128)  How do I make a \\\"busy cursor\\\" while my application is computing? Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?   The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is  as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel  window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other  application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the  user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual  desktop.) Substitute \\\"toplevel\\\" with your top-most widget here (similar code  should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):       unsigned long valuemask;      XSetWindowAttributes attributes;       /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */      valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;      attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |          ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);      attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);       /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by         its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */      XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,          65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,          CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);  where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen, particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767.  When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to normal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well.  In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor  resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events.

An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which  continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its  children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X  connection to the display.   What you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process,    close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget))); to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your  exec. You will then be able to exit the parent.  Alternatively, before exec'ing make this call, which causes the file  descriptor to be closed on exec.

Greg Holmberg (holmberg@frame.com), 3/93.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 130)  Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler?   No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical  sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which  might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave the library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by  Xlib or Xt functions.  You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added.   Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly  Volume 6 are in error.  [Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse  (converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 131)  What are these \\\"Xlib sequence lost\\\" errors?   You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error  handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or  Xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?   It's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input  both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but  which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or  the other file descriptor.  A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor, use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be  called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your  program's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt  callback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only non-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.  Most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an  input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.  Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file. You will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending. XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is  called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is new data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always  ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almost always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the  type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your  function to test whether there is new data:       if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return; But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a  busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting  a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.

You can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting the window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget which should receive the event.   If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use  XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you avoid a round-trip to the server.  Depending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call its action procedures in order to get the effects you want.  [courtesy Mark A. Horstman (mh2620@sarek.sbc.com), 11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 134)  Why doesn't anything appear when I run this simple program?    You are right to map the window before drawing into it. However, the  window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen -- until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will  generally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code  would appear after window was created and mapped:   while (!done)     {       XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);       switch (the_event.type) {  case Expose:  /* On expose events, redraw */   XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);   break;  ...  }     }   Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't  set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background  colors, so this program could previously include this code:   ...   the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */   the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */   the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,                 GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);   ...   Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is  black and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1  and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be  reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.  Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong  thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for  foreground and background.  And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program if you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may not yet have appeared.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?   The 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A  server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0, unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit -- the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available  Screens on this particular Display connection.  The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.  In Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine  the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.  (Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the Screen have \\\"Display\\\" in the names --  XDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

It works by building a set of C++ classes in parallel to the class tree of the  widgets.  The C++ InterViews toolkit is obtainable via anonymous FTP from  interviews.stanford.edu. InterViews uses a box/glue model similar to that of  TeX for constructing user interfaces and supports multiple looks on the user  interfaces. Some of its sample applications include a WYSIWIG document editor  (doc), a MacDraw-like drawing program (idraw) and an interface builder  (ibuild).  THINGS,  a class library written at the Rome Air Force Base by the  Strategic Air Command, available as freeware on archive sites.   Motif++ is a public-domain library that defines C++ class wrappers for Motif 1.1; it adds an \\\"application\\\" class for, e.g., initializing X, and also integrates WCL and the Xbae widget set. This work was developed by Ronald van  Loon <rvloon@cv.ruu.nl> based on X++, a set of bindings done by the University  of Lowell Graphics Research Laboratory.

Versions of the CLX Lisp bindings are part of the X11 core source  distributions. A version of CLX is on the R5 tape [10/91]; version 5.0.2 [9/92] is on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/CLX.R5.02.tar.Z.   The SAIC Ada-X11 bindings are through anonymous ftp in /pub from stars.rosslyn.unisys.com (128.126.164.2).   There is an X/Ada study team sponsored by NASA JSC, which apparently is working out bindings. Information: xada@ghg.hou.tx.us.  GNU SmallTalk has a beta native SmallTalk binding to X called STIX (by Steven.Byrne@Eng.Sun.COM). It is still in its beginning stages, and  documentation is sparse outside the SmallTalk code itself. The sources are  available as /pub/gnu/smalltalk-1.1.1.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu (18.71.0.38) or  ugle.unit.no (129.241.1.97).

No.  Once set, the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be  re-read by clients.  The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap, set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The  window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're  sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea()  to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read  back that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and  it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD  and Stuart Marks of Sun]   Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a  (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the  original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved.  [courtesy Jim Fulton, MIT X Consortium]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 139)  How do I create a transparent window?    A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly window. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have several choices:  - the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to make non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers  support the extension.  - a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note  that there is no X notion of a \\\"transparent color index\\\".  - a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny  windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.  - a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly.  [thanks to der Mouse, mouse@lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU, 3/92; see also The X Journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for this last option]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 140)  Why doesn't GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values?   When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a background of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black and White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break.]  If you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be  allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre-computed values.  If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you  can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics  context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over  red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red.  This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and  blue.

Make sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red, green, and blue  fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is  full-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color)  the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is  usually black.

I have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the  standard colormap, but it doesn't work.    XGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does  not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists. Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.

The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there  -- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using XFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever  color you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a  mask). [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 144)  How do I check whether a window ID is valid? My program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it.   Because X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window  would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the event without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow  errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed  and its ID reallocated to another window.  [courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?   Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually, the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that  knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except for GCs and private color cells, can be shared].  The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple  applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the applications' running on different machines) is in the first application to  create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into it. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also knows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.  [Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]  Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level  cooperation among your applications.   Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to  use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it  should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.

A number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return  the wrong child of root. A general solution is to add this code or to use it in your own application where you would normally use RootWindow(dpy,screen):  /* Function Name: GetVRoot  * Description: Gets the root window, even if it's a virtual root  * Arguments: the display and the screen  * Returns: the root window for the client  */ #include <X11/Xatom.h> Window GetVRoot(dpy, scr) Display        *dpy; int             scr; { Window          rootReturn, parentReturn, *children; unsigned int    numChildren; Window          root = RootWindow(dpy, scr); Atom            __SWM_VROOT = None; int             i;    __SWM_VROOT = XInternAtom(dpy, \\\"__SWM_VROOT\\\", False);   XQueryTree(dpy, root, &rootReturn, &parentReturn, &children, &numChildren);   for (i = 0; i < numChildren; i++) {  Atom            actual_type;  int             actual_format;  long            nitems, bytesafter;  Window         *newRoot = NULL;   if (XGetWindowProperty(dpy, children[i], __SWM_VROOT, 0, 1,      False, XA_WINDOW, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems,             &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newRoot) == Success && newRoot) {    root = *newRoot;    break;   }  }   return root; }  [courtesy David Elliott (dce@smsc.sony.com). Similar code is in ssetroot, a version of xsetroot distributed with tvtwm. 2/91]  A header file by Andreas Stolcke of ICSI on export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/vroot.h  functions similarly by providing macros for RootWindow and DefaultRootWindow; code can include this header file first to run properly in the presence of a virtual desktop.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 147)  How do I keep a window from being resized by the user?   Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but  there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. You can try setting  the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best.  [1/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 148)  How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times?   It's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself [e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped --  imagine the conflict between two such programs running.    The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily assuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do  this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup  menus or other short parameter-setting windows).  [thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu); 7/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 149)  How do I make text and bitmaps blink in X?   There is no easy way.  Unless you're willing to depend on some sort of extension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself, either by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games with the colormap and changing the color of the contents.  [Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 7/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib?   Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help  get notification of double-clicking.  There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the  protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do  client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you  have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish  implementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of  the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.  Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should be the single-click action or the double-click action.

Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics  capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics libraries.  Your only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to render the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it \\\"by  hand\\\" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via  XPutImage(); more specifically:  1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.  2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).  3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.  4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where    a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)   b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)  5) render I2  Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.  The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X  also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS, although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer.  In addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph.

Most of the Flames neglected to show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at least five posts! The Flames best line was probably Skrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary Suter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored by D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made some bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially impressive.   The games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and never recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches, hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren Rychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals).

I just thought of another one, in the Bible, so it's definately not because of *lack* of religion.  The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for other reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy and peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions  lying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice, peaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to mind...  I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally intended for.  That doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in the Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own stomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to kill by their leaders.  The point is that there are many things involved in religion that often lead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant side effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching between Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.    @Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest parts of Man's history.@  Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological social caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs. The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to further their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these were groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more powerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples because there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over religion that he does not have many choices.  Well, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of little silver butter-dishes.  -ciao\",\" You're getting warmer.  The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be depressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just about (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working correctly is totally drop safe.  Now, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single documented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because he failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely prevented the office from getting shot.  The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire. This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down intentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a 'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else. By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece. From the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of firing it.  The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be familiar with that particular type of firearm.\",\" It appears that Walla Walla College will fill the same role in alt.atheist that Allegheny College fills in alt.fan.dan-quayle.

I got it from a The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the editor.       Saint Aloysius Gonzaga      The Patron of Youth       The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince     Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured     soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of     Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and     honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in     the manner expected.      Saint Aloysius' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from     praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the     life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this     life.  As  Saint  Aloysius grew, he began to resemble his mother     more than his father.      Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father's     soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he     fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an     example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).      About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received     from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself     became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and     asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.      He wanted to share Our Lord's suffering to show  his  reciprocal     love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the     finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of     wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.     While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his     younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.     Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well     with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,     intelligent and always had something interesting to say.       Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint Igna-     tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)     towards which Saint Aloysius         -12-            began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the     marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.      After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in     order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even      through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the     religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.      The Marquis' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his     son:  \\\"Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-     ness?\\\" \\\"I will not, father,\\\" was the  in-evitable  reply. \\\"Then     leave from my sight and don't return until you change your mind!\\\"     With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to pray:     \\\"Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!\\\" He knelt down     to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but     this  time he was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This     at last brought the proud man to his senses. \\\"The Lord wants him,     the Lord can have him.\\\" He gave his consent for his son to become     a Jesuit.      After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-     ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and     could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-     sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare     the dying for a holy death.      Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from carrying  and     nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever     and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul to  the  Lord     while gazing at a crucifix.      Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his     humility, purity and confidence in prayer.      Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, pray for us.      - Brendan Arthur           Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of     others as a sword is to a soldier  God Bless  From Simon Lines:  106\",\"OK.

I disagree with this conclusion about the _applicability_ of the  Islamic law to all muslims, wherever they may be. The above conclusion  does not strictly follow from the foregoing, but only the conclusion  that the fatwa cannot be *enforced* according to Islamic law. However,  I do agree that the punishment cannot be applied to Rushdie even *were* it well founded.    Certainly putting a price on the head of Rushdie in Britain is a criminal  act according to Islamic law.     Yes.    \",\"  Are there any further stories to report on the eve' of Norm's farewell  from the twin cities? In an earlier post, it was announced that Norm  Green was given until midnight of the last home-game of the North Stars to cleanup his belongings and turn in the keys to the arena.  Did this happen? Was Norm run-out-of-town?  Rumor has it that while he was attempting to remove the score board,  the score-board fell to the ice and flattened Mr. Greedy to a large piece of green paper. Arena management had to use the Zamboni (which  they confiscated from Norm's truck) to clean-up the useless remains. \",\" I bet it suddenly started sticking when you  started leaving the PC running the menu all night.  There is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software in PC's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input via a DOS call rather than a BIOS call (as menus often use) otherwise the code to update the date after midnight never gets called.   Somebody might be able to correct the details in case I've mis-rememberred them, but I think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources) or add a TSR or system patch or something.  As far as I know the CMOS clock keeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than DOS's clock).\",\"With a sound card on interrupt 5, two serial ports (one for modem on i4, one for Miracle Piano on i3) and a printer port on i7, I have run out of low interrupts.  What I would like is a mouse port with an interrupt of 10, 11, or 12 (which ever interrupt the PS/2 mouse port uses) in in ISA i486 computer.  I called technical support of Microsoft, Logitech, & ATI (checked what interrupts the mouse port on the ATI video cards can use) and they all said the only interrupts possible on these cards was ones lower than 7.  Does anyone know of any board for an ISA bus which will allow a mouse port (or even a serial port) with high interrupts?\",\"  The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit 'fuzzy regions'.  These are described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in a three body system.  The probe was launched into this region for the earth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow down. The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without expending fuel, we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible\\\". The originator of the technique said that NASA wasn't interested, but that Japan was because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel for deceleration.   This from an issue of 'Science News' or 'The Planetary Report' I believe, about 2 months ago(?). \",\" Yes, you could.   Well, letsee (whipping out HP-48SX, soon to be GX): 6 inches/3*10^8 m/s=.5 nanoseconds resolution.  Hmm.  That'll be rather difficult!  The more standard (read: better) method is to use ultrasound, generally somewhere around 40kHz.  Sound travels a heck of a lot slower than light (radio waves), and is therefore much easier to deal with.   It might be easiest to visit a hardware store and look at the numerous \\\"sonic estimator\\\" type devices that do what you want here.  Many are pretty  cheap too -- <$30.  (In fact, for awhile the Stanley Estimator was selling for something like $8.  That's the one I bought! :-) )\",\"  One interpretation I've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin  of physically abusing one's wife.  The husband is usually physically  stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.   He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an  example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.  This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what  is God's will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals  His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some  degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding  of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the  husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.   One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband  and to the husband through the wife. \",\": Are the Serbs doing the work of God?  Hmm...  : I've been wondering if anyone would ever ask the question,  : Are the governments of the United States and Europe not moving : to end the ethnic cleansing by the Serbs because the targets are : muslims?  : Can/Does God use those who are not following him to accomplish : tasks for him?

Scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the Arena.  Best  strategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E. Taylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45, when the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell and will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.       Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on;  what's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).

(Sorry all HP fans, but I have a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their (excellent) gear).  One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is whether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock the instrument into real time capture mode.   I agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus. However, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students) seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or more knobs required of a \\\"real\\\" scope :-)   This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at least they appear to be logically laid out.  One more thing about the new, \\\"simpler\\\", front panels. These instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the instruments.

It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fighting for independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The war against Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of  the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction of Azeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60 thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place. This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule, is said in the document.     Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every effort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan, and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.    It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine, food, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees from Kelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the  sick and the wounded men.--O--   60 REFUGEES FROM KELBAJAR PERISHED IN THEIR ESCAPE LORRIES        BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, during the evacuation from Kelbajar region, 60 refugees on board two lorries were killed in the fire from the Armenian Tanks on the only road to leave Kelbajar. According to press -service of Azerbaijan president, no one survived the tragedy. --O--   SITUATION IN THE REGION OF KELBAJAR     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attempts to evacuate the rest of 15,000 citizens, encircled on alpine villages of the region of Kelbajar  went on within the last twenty-four hours. Evacuation helicopters could not land near these villages because of shelling from the Armenian side and existence of fog. Measures are undertaken to air-drop food and medicine to the encircled people.    Several hundred people succeed within the last twenty-four hours to get out of the region of Kelbajar via mountain range. Refugees are  settled in the neighboring regions of Azerbaijan and in Ganja.  Authorities face serious problem with rendering refugees medical  aid and food. The number of refugees from Kelbajar is over 40,000 people. Azerbaijan is not capable of handling a disaster of this magnitude.--0--   ARMENIAN ARMY CONTINUES ATTACK ON FIZULI     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: The region of Fizuli of Azerbaijan,  situated outside of the territory of Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag, has been subjected to heaviest attacks of Armenian army for the fourth day. About 30 armored technique and more than 500 soldiers of the enemy are taking part in the attack.    Armenian units broke the defence line of the azeri forces and occupied the ruling height from where the town is shelled from \\\"Grad\\\" installations, this morning. There is heavy destructions in the town and more than 20 people are dead. Population of the town is hastily evacuated.--0--   PRESS-CONFERENCE OF THE CHIEF OF PRESS-SERVICE OF PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Fifty-five thousand refugees from the region of Kelbajar were taken out by 11 o'clock on April 5, informed the chief of the press-service of president of Azerbaijan, Arif Aliev, today.    Journalists were also informed at the press-conference that International Red Cross is helping to accept and render refugees medical aid. There is an urgent need to supply the refugees with tents, food and medical aid.    Arif Aliev informed that as a result of the ongoing tragedy brought on by the latest aggression of Armenia, the leadership of Azerbaijan intends to appeal to Azerbaijanis and all those who treasure human life all over the world for help.    Concerning the reaction of the international community to aggression  of Armenia, Aliev said the department of state of the USA has expressed its anxiety to leadership of Armenia.    Participants of peace efforts in Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag under CSCE, Rafaelli, Mareska and Chetin strongly blamed the aggression of  Armenia against Azerbaijan.    Leader of press-service informed that tomorrow ambassador of  Azerbaijan in Russia, Hikmet Haji-zade, will conduct a press-conference in Moscow. Detailed information on latest events in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan will be given at the press-conference.--0--   AZERBAIJANIS PICKET IN FRONT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF RUSSIA     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Azerbaijanis, living in Moscow, picketed in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia. Picket was conducted as a token of protest against participation of Russian units in capture of the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan by Armenians. About 100 people took part in the picket, organized by Azerbaijani society \\\"Dayag\\\".--0--   PICKET OF SADVALERS IN MOSCOW     BAKU (5 APRIL) 30-40 members of \\\"Sadval\\\" society picketed before the building of permanent representation of Azerbaijan in Moscow. Picketers were demanding the return of Lezghins lands, as if annexed by Azerbaijan.    Ambassador of Azerbaijan in Moscow, Hikmet Haji-zade classified this action as provocation aimed at creating a further inter-ethnic conflict in Azerbaijan. He marked in his talk with the Turan correspondent that he does not rule out a connection between the Armenian aggression in the region of Kelbajar and this anti- azerbaijani action of the \\\"Sadval\\\" society in Moscow. He also marked that 30-40 people do not mean the Lezghian nationality in the whole.    Society of Lezghins, \\\"Sadval\\\", registered in Moscow in 1990, demands the creation of a Lezghistan state, which never existed before on the northern territories of Azerbaijan.--0--   ATTACK OF ARMENIAN UNITS STOPPED     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attack of Armenian army on the town of  Fizuli, which began in the last twenty-four hours, is stopped, informs  the press-service of the Ministry of Defence of Azerbaijan.    In the result of undertaken measures, 6 tanks and a number of  the attackers were destroyed. Advance units of the Armenian army retreated several kilometers.    Chairman of the parliament, Isa Gambar, visited the town of  Fizuli and met with commanders of the units of the national army and local citizens, today.--0--   STATEMENT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan  issued a statement in connection with aggression of Armenia in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan.    It is stated in the statement that regular units of the armed forces of Armenia captured the town of Kelbajar on April 3 .   Attack of Armenian units, which began on March 27 deep in the territory of Azerbaijan still continues. Armenia has occupied at present 7500 sq.km of the territory of Azerbaijan.    Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari (Upper) Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered a specially dangerous phase. This is the result of non-recognition of  Armenia as an aggressor by the international community, is marked in the document.    It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russian army are participating in the Armenian attack. This casts doubt on the sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict.    It is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of Armenia  have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of CSCE.    The document contains the appeal to the world community to stop Armenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctions against the aggressor.--0--   Serdar Argic\",\"    So.

What    follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.     [Reproduced without permission]      The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,  where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under  the tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,  presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if  a person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group  of 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and  sugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after  drinking the artificially sweetened beverage.     The study received widespread media attention and stirred a  good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.  However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers  did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did  actually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not  necessarily go hand in hand.     In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining  the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.  And after reviewing every one of them, the director of the  Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins  University, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-  sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in  the amount of food eaten afterward.      One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing  cancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a  host of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government  has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing  everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.  Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and  after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm  that it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the  Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with  monitoring public health), the American Medical Association's  Council on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration  have given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a  clean bill of health.     Granted, the FDA has set forth an \\\"acceptable daily intake\\\" of  50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed  the limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take  in 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of  aspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,  or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...  A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams  of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups  of yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content  of selected foods omitted]     Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away  from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called  phenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000  to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential  amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child  consumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause  such severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with  PKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other  aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \\\"Phenylketonurics:  Contains Phenylalanine.\\\" \",\" code deleted...

The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted (\\\"why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go.\\\").   3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.    Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the  heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is normally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because  moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine  low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best.    A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the condenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the  condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too  hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs.    The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower  they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120  degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer, operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order  to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area.  At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical \\\"95-95\\\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East. It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure.   True.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard  stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves. The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water.

One thing I can't stand about the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for most work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at the moment.)  I don't think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in less time IF you are experienced.

By trying to inject the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without adding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could be \\\"Is a polydactyl person a human being?\\\"  You still have not answered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.   You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies. If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule, provide it for me.   More irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does not follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out, brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights of the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant difference.  What I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the thread you started?  You got answers to your questions when you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected, changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion of substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance, why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss silly accussations, e.g. \\\"It really doesn't matter to you...\\\" If it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek some substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic and show some meaning to your words.   As others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on which has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy fails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here. A woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would not be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?   Is it?  Please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.   You simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is not accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on for size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments. But the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The systems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.   Your argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total failure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in reality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible, that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said, you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said, there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to its claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?   You haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.   Again you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and it is not as slow as you seem to think.   Yes, and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that he was murdered by a religious, \\\"pro-life\\\" fanatic.  Please do try to stay relevant.   Clever comeback.  I congratulate you on the readiness of your wit.  What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake? Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What is different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction anyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at parties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.\",\" Why not?

Contents:  * In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem? * What is an attack? * What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically? * Why is the one-time pad secure? * What's a ciphertext-only attack? * What's a known-plaintext attack? * What's a chosen-plaintext attack? * In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks? * What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?   * In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?    A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a   decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of   functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of   ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the   decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that   D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption   of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key   (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext   into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to   encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.  * What is an attack?    In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method   of starting with some information about plaintexts and their   corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out   more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state   mathematically what this means. Here we go.    Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,   and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.    An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an   algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that   there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have   f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this   probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).    The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at   least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and   g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible   ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other   words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions   E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).    An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if   n = 2, and so on.  * What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?    In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.   Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this   property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem   is strong!''    In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely   formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is   strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against   all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as   defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this   statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist   any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement   to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that   the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.    Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical   definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions   we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can   figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used   properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.    The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst   can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to   construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,   and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.    * Why is the one-time pad secure?    By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the   plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)   of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive   or) of K and P.    It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial   single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform   distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform   distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,   i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,   with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and   g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of   K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also   be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is   uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p   that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus   a fortiori A is trivial.)    On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used   for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial   multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be   thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';   this explains the name ``one-time pad.''  * What's a ciphertext-only attack?    In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is   constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about   n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some   information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial   if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given   G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.    For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can   easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply   guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use   the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no   matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which   produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.   If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is   a nontrivial attack.  * What's a known-plaintext attack?    The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,   G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.   In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption   P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the   other decryption P_2.    Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature   as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the   cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him   decrypt further messages.  * What's a chosen-plaintext attack?    A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical   series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the   cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into   our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a   chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and   look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured   out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of   attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''    A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption   attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a   way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.    There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:   for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as   T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew   for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash   function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.  * In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?    Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some   plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're   also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find   K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).    If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed   on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results   only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial   attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many   possible keys.  * What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?    Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys   randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to   for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which   are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English   words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much   faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.\",\" I do not know a lot about this, except from seeing one patient with \\\"Kartagener's syndrome\\\", which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome in which there is situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic infections. \\\"Situs inversus\\\" means that organs are on the wrong side of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the \\\"normal\\\" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in absence of this, laterality can be \\\"random.\\\" People with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong side).   According to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal recessive, which should imply that on average one child in four in a family would be affected. But there may be much more current information on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking about more than one conditiion.

I spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently,  by coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that  while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the  Church as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church  recoginizes itself as a community of believers, members of the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable to each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island, there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without the priest being present, but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area.     I remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus, married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the community.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with one another--the community should be able to rely on that  couple to be as one.   While couples may marry without witnesses, they  may NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An  anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage at all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half-hour later!!   I tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage, but I would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they intended to be married, assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a commitment, I believe, in God's eyes.

Come on, Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant. Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders.   YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**. Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.  But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel doesn't have a game like that in him.   Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about Roussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah, Dom has played well too.   FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a team picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the same picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning, Kasper...   Mostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain autographs on the team photos. I don't like that method since I've seen guards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they got their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies.\",\"   The one I got only does about 4kb/s in text and 320x200 (VGA/MCGA) mode, which is almost identical to the other W5186 based cards (ATI 68800 does about 6kb/s).  This is weird since the Orchid supposedly should be much faster (and I was told by someone that it can do almost 16 kb/s), since the VGA chip is covered by the Orchid label, I can't really tell for sure if it uses a 5286 chip, but the spec. sheet that comes with the board (no docs!) did say it has 1 meg dram and uses a 5286 chip. Winmarks (3.11) is about 4 mil. slower than a Viper (34 vs ~38) using standard palette.

Blackman, Research Coordinator for NRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89. -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear sir:  By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of  momentus \\\"scientific\\\" findings. These are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings. Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists.  The latest effort -- \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities,\\\" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying  editorial, \\\"Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,\\\" by two employees of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular order.   1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to   support the statement that \\\"some have argued that restricting  access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate  of homicide.\\\" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that  contention.    2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very  similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,  demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities  are very different with very different demographic characteristics  which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in  Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white  and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be  the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-  grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various  ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.    3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,  compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all  the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect  in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-  1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth  involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM  article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving  handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that  one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding  that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that  a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day  for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without  at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?    4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national  gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily  selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because  it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific  reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which  involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar \\\"control\\\"?  Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite  \\\"scientific\\\" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide  rate *exceeds* that of such \\\"wild west\\\" cities in Texas as  El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado  Springs. (Ref. 3)    5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or  handguns \\\"are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in  Vancouver.\\\" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending  to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is  an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry  permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in  Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of  handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun  owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number  of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns  for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns  legally for protection, registration figures are  meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York  City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,  that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population  in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver  has a greater \\\"prevalence of weapons\\\" than New York City.    The second method of measuring gun density is \\\"Cook's gun  prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity  differences.\\\" But the validation was by Cook of his own  theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a  different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is  based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement  in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking  a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide  (42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in  homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in  Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-  ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and  Vancouver.    6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and  Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that  Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to  the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian  law for owning and carrying handguns for personal  protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more  difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually  the case.    7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain  the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the  penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of   clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a  firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number  of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making  arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest  rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences  imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,  or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social  scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,  the authors of the NEJM \\\"tale of two cities\\\" fail even to mention  most factors related to crime control.    8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective  means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not  the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost  650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from  criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the  liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be  completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury  to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors  reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides  without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle  accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides  involving firearms.    9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the \\\"study,\\\"  editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it \\\"applied  scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb  advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly  handguns.\\\" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly  be mistaken for \\\"scientific methods\\\" by a sociologists or  criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle \\\"study\\\" is the equivolent  of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding  two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25  and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,  administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while  giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure  and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure,   announcing in a \\\"special article\\\" a new medical breakthrough.  It would be nice to think that such a \\\"study\\\" would neither be  funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.    Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC  make them willing to present shoddy research as \\\"scientific  breakthroughs\\\" in \\\"special articles\\\" and editorials relating  to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying  the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight  over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about  the distortions contained in \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,  and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities\\\" and \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call  for Science.\\\" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside  whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize  an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.

Wright           (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)     suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\\\"  The problem is demonstrated    by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting    to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by    the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal    of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and    suggested that a handgun ban \\\"may reduce the rate of homicide in a     community.\\\"       The nine medical doctors who published \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime,    Assaults, and Homicide\\\" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite    many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver    has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations    make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems    indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period    1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.    Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,    Why?       The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case    to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,    that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their    evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and     unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point    does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support    of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody    knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We    are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that    a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates    when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.       Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two    indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-    weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons    permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the    permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable. *     The second bit of evidence is \\\"Cook's gun prevalence index,\\\" which stands *  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index *  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in  *  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage *  of homicides and suicides involving firearms. *     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides, *  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take *  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be *  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides *  is directly related to their relative availability in the general  *  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To *  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to \\\"prove\\\" it on the basis of *  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.       Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that    guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.    The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun    ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates    reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,    that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.       In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of    violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the     consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin     Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime    for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke    an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.       Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data    on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are \\\"similar in    many ways,\\\" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law    stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish    the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that \\\"all    else is equal\\\" among things being compared. *     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look  *  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime *  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage *  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle *  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent. *  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the *  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half- *  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown *  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out. *     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is *  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates *  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide *  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver. *  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due *  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks, *  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics *  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison *  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial *  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle *  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain *  in either city.       Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the    cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority     groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in \\\"gun availability\\\"    (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not    matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why    blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed    in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,    do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)       Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between    Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have     anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol     abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city    of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the     Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the    United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian    percentage?       The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many    ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent    more detailed analysis, nearly any of these \\\"many ways\\\" might explain part    or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such    as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal. *     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide *  result in a \\\"complex picture.\\\"  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing *  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They *  also acknowledge that \\\"socio-economic status is probably an important *  confounding factor in our comparison,\\\" remarking further that \\\"blacks    *  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of *  Vancouver's population.\\\"  Given the evidence presented in the article, *  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle *  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial *  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility, *  since \\\"detailed information about household incomes according to race *  is not available for Vancouver.\\\"       The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in     gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple    example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms    of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one     would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.    Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce     crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into    account?  In this example, the \\\"hidden variable\\\" is city size: Guns are    more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city    problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the    appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very    seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities    for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,    and their results are impossible to interpret.       In the editorial \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science\\\" accompanying    the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the    authors for applying \\\"scientific methods\\\" to a problem of grave public    heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from    nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate    plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them    out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are    little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this    study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical    identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--    is cause for further concern.

The Mets and Astros joined the N.L. in 1962. \",\" After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals, but before IBM had decided to respond, I argued strenuously that they  should not; they should keep it proprietary.   The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscomb was the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunately for all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above question much better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gain acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessary complexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would  authority.  In fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15  years.  We have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, invented and proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined and vetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not subject to influence by any of these.  Even now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trust the DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of the public scrutiny.  (Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to  gain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basis of authority alone.)  We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can \\\"break\\\" the DES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time they can \\\"break\\\" anything.  The important question is at what cost and in what time.  The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important as what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand the cost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way. At this point, we may never replace either because of the inability of any successor to overcome this knowledge gap.  DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography.

No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail buffer can claim they are \\\"too young\\\" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet. The eighties were about \\\"How America Learned to Win Once Again\\\". Then (wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win. No Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer (We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no holds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a few \\\"little\\\" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an S&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to contend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never had it so good.    In the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one doesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a \\\"kinder and gentler type of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of discourse about people who \\\"don't get it\\\". For those of us in the winning business, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no  suggestion of losing.   But what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our  \\\"white male\\\" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out  photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one with a \\\"Hail Mary\\\" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'three yards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses in the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the  weapon of choice these days.     Who is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on  your face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This  is known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt  sure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the  same. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to  take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?   What we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is  the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood used to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott declaimed, \\\"Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will  not tolerate a loser.\\\" And so on.    The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and Democrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some  \\\"equitable\\\" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a  loser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian homosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%)  minority.   Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most conservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care who's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say something about make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition). In the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a  \\\"neoconservative\\\" or a \\\"neoliberal\\\" depending on how much you want to limit the pot.   Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be popular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still be popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I  would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it is the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any other place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in Columbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to  see more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious  preference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of  them be white men !!

Velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside of stock airboxes on a number of bikes.  At a tuned engine rpm, the stacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air rushing in. Air momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside long after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke. Shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from escaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion chambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing) to the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they design for shock waves.\",\"  Close. My mother comes from Gainesville Tex, right across the border.

Mike  Just relaying what I know...a not for profit service.  \",\"  The company was probably \\\"Public Missiles, Inc\\\" of Michigan.   Yup.   Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to  purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be one of the following: a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations:  The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.  The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any  organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions  to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are: - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.  - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.  Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).  The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members' use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet.   By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \\\"F\\\" motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart C, for details.  As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute, or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.  Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.   Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.   That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest misconceptions people have about our hobby.   True. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get  hit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand. \",\"Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think it's great!  However, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answers to the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why?  Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.  I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?  Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?  Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost?  I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2?  Thanks for any comments.\",\"Hi,  My friend's 1983 Toyota Tercel accelerates by itself without using the gas peddel.

I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target, then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to harm.  But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away, heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this moment is hazy.  I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not. So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!  Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.  What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?  I eagerly await comment.

It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew must learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) The land in this country must pass into Jewish hands, i.e. to the same new Jew who has \\\"learned\\\" to work it. Both aspects of the two-pronged concept of \\\"Hebrew labor\\\" have racist connotations. On the one hand, the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical labor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other hand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the Arab farmer from the source of his livelihood.  The occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from the occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and hot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of \\\"Hebrew labor\\\" to the history books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement. It has blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to problems caused by the closure of the territories. Today too this concept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the closing of the Palestinian population.  Or in the words of Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, \\\"I have no tears for those who get rich off of cheap labor\\\". 2) to furnish an answer to the unemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.\",\" Just to make sure everyone is clear on this: \\\"it never has\\\" refers to  \\\"protects\\\", not \\\"fails to protect\\\"; i.e., in my lifetime I have never seen  the U.S. government consistently protect the interest of U.S. citizens,  except by accident. \",\" :  really involved there).

My experience of Christianity (25+ years) is that most Christians seek answers from clergymen who have little or no direct experience of spiritual matters, and that most of these questions can be answered by simple introspection.  Most people suspect that they cannot trust their senses, but few take the next step to figure out that they can trust themselves.  Not to get too esoteric, but it seems that most religions, Christianity included, are founded by particularly intuitive people who understand this.  (stuff deleted)   And what if the original poster, Pixie, is never \\\"converted?\\\" Does it make sense that she (or I, or the majority of humanity for that matter) would go to hell for eternity, as many  Christians believe?

Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it (as long as my advisor doesn't catch me - which is easy enough to do), but  stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review  committees and the peer review process in general.  In today's world that's  what determines what science is: what gets funded.  And a damn good thing to. Flights of fantasy just don't have much chance of producing anything, at  least not in biomedical research.  The surest way for a graduate student to ruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with  fleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a project that actually has a good chance of producing some results.

If the (naive) market is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong  encryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast standard, and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard, but it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market with cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry's technology is better, the programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard. Who could compete?

One approach is simply to try and move political opinion and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Another approach is to try and amend the constitution.  The original constitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention for 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it. The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains government (particularly state and local), even though on many particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I think libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via an amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).  Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this as a problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That might be true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  If a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then falls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This is unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now, but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of, if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.\",\" Hi Janet,  Sounds exactly like mine.  Same circumstance, same onset symptoms,  same cafergot uselessness, same duration.  In fact, of all the people I know who have migraines, none have been so similar.  There is such a wide variation between people with respect to what causes their headaches, that I generally don't bother sharing what I've learned about mine, but since ours seem to be alike, here are my observations.  I don't think it's heat, per se (I've had more in winter than summer). Dehydration could conceivably figure, though.  Try tanking up before playing rather than after.

Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit (which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).

Whether you like it or not, whether Rushdie acted like a total jerk or not, there is no acceptable civilized basis for putting someone in fear of their life for words.  It simply does not matter whether his underlying motive was to find the worst possible way he could to insult Muslims and their beliefs, got that? You do not threaten the life of someone for words - when you do, you quite simply admit the backruptcy of your position.  If you support threatening the life of someone for words, you are not yet civilized.  This is exactly where I, and many of the people I know, have to depart from respecting the religions of others.  When those beliefs allow and encourage (by interpretation) the killing of non-physical opposition.  You, or I or anyone, are more than privledged to believe that someone, whether it be Rushdie or Bush or Hussien or whover, is beyond the pale of civilized society and you can condemn his/her soul, refuse to allow any members of your association to interact with him/her, _peacably_ demonstrate to try to convince others to disassociate themselves from the \\\"miscreants\\\", or whatever, short of physical force.

It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at 65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv) and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be cheap.    My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each compariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).  The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the compariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my circuit would not detect it.     The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this work.    There are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require  split supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator with three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply circuit.    At this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor circuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...  Unfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designing transistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Any ideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly appreciated.    Oh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so I don't need a fast response time at all, however, I haven't found a way to take advantage of that fact.

Mike.S \",\"   As John Gilmore has pointed out repeatedly, if you produce the infrastructure that would permit a police state to function, all that is required to suddenly find yourself living in one is a change of attitude on the part of the government.  Our constitution was built by men who had to risk their lives to ensure freedom in our country. They designed the system to make it difficult for tyranny to arise. For instance, one of the reasons the fourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the government to try to make smuggling a crime. Think I jest? John Hancock made all his money smuggling rum, which is, after all, a drug.  Think about it. The government has everyones keys in escrow, and the FBI gets their pet \\\"wiretap without leaving the office\\\" scheme. There is a coup, which happens every day all around the world. Within hours, everyone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is being monitored more closely than ever before possible.  Without the tools being in place, a tyranny cannot stand. With tools like this in place, a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be successfully imposed.  Why give the government tools with which to enslave you? Maybe you can trust Bill Clinton, but are you willing to tell me that you can trust EVERY government that will ever arise in the U.S. hereafter? I am not willing to make that leap of faith.   I'm a political dissident. As such, I am acutely aware of what happens to political dissidents in most of the world. In most of the world, I could be killed for my beliefs. Call Amnesty International some time to find out what happens to dissidents in most of the world.  All that seperates the U.S. from most of those places is a thin piece of parchment in the National Archives thats being constantly more and more eroded by such farces as the war on drugs. Coups have happened in countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years. Governments throughout history have fallen. No government has lasted for more than a few hundred years. Often, they are replaced by dictatorships. Do you really believe so intensely that it could never ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and the lives of your children and other loved ones on it?  If we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced, we make it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen, because if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually stick.   Naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where hundreds that have gone before have failed. Thriving democracies led by men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen to dictatorship. Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled men before they became a tyranny.  I, for one, am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here. Only hubris would allow us to believe we are immune to what has happened elsewhere.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\"CDs for sale shipping is included  Barcelona Gold  Freddie Mercury, Tevin Campbell, En Vogue    INXS, Madonna, Eric Clapton, Sarah Brightman    ($9.00)  Wayne's World  Queen, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Alice Cooper    Eric Clapton    ($9.00)  Extreme II  Pronograffitti    ($9.00)  Saturday Night Live Band Live from New York    ($7.00)  Harry Connick, JR.

There \\\"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.\\\"          Thanx in advance... Shaz....  [I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions. The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style of the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significant differences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying text.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by hand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the original, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are generally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved, but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there's much uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error.  But I also don't think there's enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that it has much practical effect.  Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot topic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it (though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details that don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there being multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in all the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've been referring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get referenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been editions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into single narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor objects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible has long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making editions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from a variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine one of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all inaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any edition that's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is. (Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a few translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best, I'm afraid.)\",\" : Logic alert -  argument from incredulity.

We've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've seen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his choice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.    From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful relationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, \\\"Why be dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to come back.\\\" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I could think of.    Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and in which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was beyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not quietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their relationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung up. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is the first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if she's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with.       I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself; angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for persisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their children; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us that he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to appease an unappeasable, emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess; scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will change and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self- righteous over this bit of proof that they can't \\\"get away\\\" with treating us or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even beginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad, sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in a horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or they can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustrated because I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me up the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence, and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not free of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO* something, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting vices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal mental chatter enough to listen for God.)

The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots  of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now  defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.  The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the  SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they  were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.  About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once  in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as  Christ.  Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young  adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over  the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.  They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of  weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US  government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were  putting themselves in a self defense position.    In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn' t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.

If they would of had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened.   If they'd gone to the door and knocked on it to serve the  warrant, like the Sheriff had done 3 other times, they  wouldn't have needed to HAVE an initial assault.  But then,  Herr Klinton and Attorney Gen'l Reno wouldn't have been  able to have told such heroic stories about how they  \\\"protected\\\" the rest of us from a group of people who  kept to themselves, miles out in the prairie.  The BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored transports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use more force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to do a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.   The BATF needs to be disbanded.  This out of control group  of Rambo wannabees is a danger to the Republic.  With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed more now then ever.

I don't know if this is believeing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do not deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions from evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere is not self explanatory).   Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence,  which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The  evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning on the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason of the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly consistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the evidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself to us.  It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come through this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones providing evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for all we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for reason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired in some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense, belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.  Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source  of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by faith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding of the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be the most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity claims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the best evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.  If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while and you will see rational debate aplenty.\",\" test \",\" Well, I would guess the probability of a BMW driver having a gun would be lower than some other vehicles.

In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called \\\"stolen hits\\\", defined as a play made that \\\"an average fielder would not make with average effort.\\\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \\\"Plays Kurt Stillwell would not have made.\\\"  OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by?  To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double Plays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).  Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't take it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article.  The short version -- definition of terms HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder NEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate. DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.

The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are  factored into SLG.  That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors.

He stressed how likely it was the the Branch Davidians would commit mass suicide.  He was concerned with the safety of the children.   What did the FBI do to defuse the situation,  Did they try to reassure Koresh?  DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD?  Did the FBI offer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working?  Did the permit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound?   What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible. They kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off their electrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their ears with loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and kept limiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure on David Koresh.   Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping to get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack the the tanks.   It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over the edge.  The blame for the deaths should be shared by both the federal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the fools at the ATF who planed the raid.   Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership have resulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people.   If every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today.

Could you give examples of privately funded ones?   Your logic certainly applies to standard investment strategies.  However, the concept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I  suspect.  I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic  benefit from Lindbergh's flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for a human powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economic benefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developed and the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the  equivalent amount of direct investment would.

Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact, for instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in 1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New  World, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence in 1776 will come 284 years later.  Shouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for  'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the  Greek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the  laurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist,  any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil  of Anatolia.  These undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It  is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows that it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock, stock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.  In fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following bloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the island of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:  The Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, the Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as  their territory. But, it has never been the possession of the government of Greece - not even for one day - in the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is located 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only  40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.  Saddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi territory and the Greek Cypriot government and  the terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus also was once part of the Greek hegemony.  Those 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront  reality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only  facts count.  As for Selanik,    <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled   particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially   as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the   total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks   led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to   the great port of Izmir.    Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual   murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek   efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912   and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,   when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>    <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow   Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to   practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923   which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new   Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a   series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where   most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This   was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting   Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also   on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica   for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By   killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a   substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting   Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the   occupation of Greece starting in 1941.    Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for   Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.   Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received   thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by   the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in   flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained   independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the   Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during   and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements   in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among   its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim   refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the   Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly   to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as   800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and   east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more   came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-   1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,   with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the   Empire.>>  [47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de   Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;   Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,   12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU   Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek   children in the streets of Salonica.

On an ironic note, where I deleted lines Emacs continually gave me the message \\\"Garbage collecting... Done.\\\"  Think it's trying to tell me something?     You lurkers can join in at any time, you know!  Ahhh.. Talk.politics.guns -- the kindler, gentler newsgroup.  Who would have thought?    I remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user. Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has only range and acurracy going for it.    I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.    That seems to be the case already, given that heavy weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low numbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks, whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.    I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the heavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders from the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large, though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated.    This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise, I would have to assume that State control would rest on the authority of the Governor and militia officers.    I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons, fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support.  Just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry. I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.    We have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble. I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in. I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.    So would I, but the resources often aren't available to outfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else.    Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton trucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units in Iowa are currently fielding in some units.   Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under State control, with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local ranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly, hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally, the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for other responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a very minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias for these functions.\",\"Pardon me for interrupting, but why doesn't anyone ever bring up other possibilities besides more government, less government, or no government and stop there?

The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project.\",\"I have a problem with icon pixmap.

Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production( toxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well  because of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got  into Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium  would prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here. But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6  supplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).  Vitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams  per day).   1. Review Article \\\"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney      stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\\\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.     5(3):110-129(1985).  But glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both  glycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this  production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine,  but to increase your intake of vitamin B6.   2. \\\"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in       patients with kidney stones\\\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)      200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary       excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.   3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\\\" Clin. Sci. 38     :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day      showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.  For gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is  required for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for  oxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is  quite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.   The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40%  of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable  and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto  6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic  acid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the  extra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a  very early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.  Med. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day  increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg  per day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was  increased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose  and 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion  before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average  before supplementation.  B6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There  are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about  yet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the  speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must  have an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then  explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C  challenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your  intake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you  take vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient  in B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate  kidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets  absorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day  showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309 -15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase  in urinary oxalate excretion.   Here are the high oxalate foods:   1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.     Contain at least 25mg/100grams   2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale,      peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.     Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.  If the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot  of latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points  out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your  intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being  absorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn't  have to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for  males and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake). B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more  per day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).    The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day  for males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with  this low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6  requirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that  either block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6  excretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol, isoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to  supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that  increase the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking  birth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the  other drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your  dietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone  formation should be given B6 supplements.  One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your  Ca/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is  calcium-oxalate.   4. \\\"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of  patients with calcium oxalate calculi\\\"Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)   5. \\\"Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the  crystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium  interaction\\\"J.

There are actually about three times as many articles published in the  medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone  formation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in  stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier  post in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I  guess that he doesn't read the medical literature.

I understand (from an unreliable source) that Canseco was considered expendable by the A's when he refused to accept any coaching about his batting stance.  The A's brain trust came to believe that his back problems were exacerbated, if not caused, by having a wide open stance, closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque (that's a paraphrase of what I remember).  In any event, Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide his stance, and the A's began to believe that he would either reinjure himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power.

I developed my own method, which requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn method.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is several comparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.

LOGICAL PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST'S RESURRECTION              1.  Jesus's enemies *would not* have stolen His                 body because that would have perpetrated the                 resurrection--the very opposite of what they                 desired.              2.  Jesus' disciples *could not* have stolen His                 body because Pontius Pilate established guards                 to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be                 stolen.              3.  Sadly (and ironically), many of Jesus' disciples                 did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus                 had risen from the dead.              4.

For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.  Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.  The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore, the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.

We had to turn down the volume!  The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the first period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that he was getting bored back there...  Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead to Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and in on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the right past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and Garry should turn down their assists :-).  The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong and kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive struggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when Terry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into the boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not a terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got a post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.  Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to give the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league didn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards the end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept missing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give the Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots were 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.  Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered a rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the season went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was Russ Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed Snider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do it all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the end of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup. He expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title the following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.  He's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \\\"outstanding\\\"). Happy with the current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable. Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus.  The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May took a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble getting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres blue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling through the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.  Then Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line and went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was all over it.  The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them. Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer took a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln't get started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the FLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and headed the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John Muckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.  But the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to just get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all over them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through Soderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it. Mistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and mistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks end for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.  Lindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking minor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get set up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended. Things evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of him. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and that meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major, 7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.  The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long they could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to Ledyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by Soderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had moved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net at 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to put it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.  The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek was strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the neutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS blue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the left circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at 18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between the 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off angles...  That was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.  Into the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the FLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in the slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he hit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.  Than an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood untouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under Soderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on, horn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange reason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...  Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS could not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through, but were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass, but twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.  But the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate out, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew in, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at 5:24 to tie the game at 4.  Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up in the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in the middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.  Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19. The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard went after it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated to the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing through the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season for Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th of the season.  Then Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres power play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the chances on the FLYERS resulting power play.  Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running  out as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres. Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found Dineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the right of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48 on his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo, and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game.  So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much in his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night (unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so). The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against with three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals despite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place since the Rangers lose the tie breaker.  A couple misc notes:  Forget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.  In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award, but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.  The Times of Trenton has reported that \\\"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\\\" has looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future.  Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he expected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back, he feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a role scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.

I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to  be able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for  granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running  3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even  a real issue. My ideal operating system:   Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize  binaries and configure on the fly, so I don't have to have  bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc...   Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac   and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which   has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in   80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips.  Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems.   Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton   or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform   or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly.  so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on    my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.   Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS  or NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.   Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have  to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch  or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.  In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight, clean kernel so you can actually understand it.

It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences. The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case. You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits?  There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently, because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor- General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting.   Some people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating food that they have harvested themselves.  The pleasure derived from hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables grown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much  freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or the supermarket).   By \\\"cannot now be justified\\\" I guess you mean that you personally don't see any justification.  Fine--but what makes your opinion so important?   Certainly the last point is correct.

Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year,     many of them are commercial businesses. The ban on commercial     use of Internet is no more.  Jack, there is a difference between using the network for commercial purposes and advertising in newsgroups.  Business communication is okay.  Advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet who have no desire to receive advertising is not okay.      Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only     by our innate good taste and no have no \\\"administrator\\\" to      guide(?) us.  I suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material not in anybody's good taste would find itself getting a lot of attention it didn't want.  You may belong to the public library, but that doesn't mean you can deface the books, disorder the stacks, or disturb the other patrons.  You're constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users (many academic and military, who get irritable about a network for which they pay with tax and grant money carrying private business advertising) follow.  There are Secret Masters here, just like everywhere else.  They're not as obvious as the ones on Prodigy, but they're here.  No doubt at some point the Internet, like everything else, will become grotty enough to carry advertising.  At that time I hope it is confined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groups---like misc.writing. \",\"Hi again,  Many thanks to all the people who responded to my request for a MS- Windows screen grabber.

I bought a used Ford Bronco (which has since been stolen...  :(  )  and few weeks after I paid and took delivery, they sent a letter telling me they goofed and  miscalculated the license renewal by $300 and that I need to send in a check to \\\"avoid further delay\\\" in the processing of my registration. The thing is, I had already received the pink slip from the DMV, so I ignored it.  I received another letter and then the phone calls started coming.  First from the finance guy and then from the general manager, both hounding me for the extra money.  They left me alone once I told them I already had the paperwork and pointed out the clause in the contract that stated that the final price was just that: FINAL. Afterall, they wouldn't budge if I had told them I wanted another $300 off after the deal had been signed, right?  I told them not  to call again and that I would not do business with them in the future. They didn't seem to have a problem with that.  This, after all, was a used Ford at a Toyota dealership.  I had a much better experience buying a new Pathfinder about a month ago.  It certainly pays to buy a car on the last Sunday of the month. It was even raining too, so they had done very little business that  weekend and were really willing to deal.  I kept telling them I would think about it, and they kept dropping the price.  Got a very good deal and so far have been very please with the service.\",\"Archive-name: ripem/faq Last-update: 31 Mar 93 22:00:00 -0500  ABOUT THIS POSTING ------------------ This is a listing of likely questions and information about RIPEM, a program for public key mail encryption.  It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.  WHAT'S NEW ---------- I am now running a World Wide Web archive of RIPEM information.  It does not contain much of anything that isn't available elsewhere, but it has convenient pointers to the most current version of this FAQ and some other stuff.  The URL is \\\"http://cs.indiana.edu/ripem/dir.html\\\".  This month's version has a fair amount of new pointers to information on patents and stuff like that.  I've also reordered a few things to have a more sensible ordering.  I hope I don't have to edit this again soon. :-)  DISCLAIMER ---------- Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything other than one layperson's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk to a real lawyer, preferably one with experience in patent law, export regulations, or whatever area of law is in question.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---------------------  1)  What is RIPEM?   RIPEM is a (not yet complete, but useful) implementation of Privacy  Enhanced Mail (PEM).  RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the  four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection  (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and  non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: \\\"What is PEM?\\\")   RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.  Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,  which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.   The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the  Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.  2)  How can I get RIPEM?   RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is  considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution  to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or  Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained  (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were  shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something  weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may  change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the  README file that this law not be violated:   #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution  #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,  #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.   Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is  included with the distribution.  You should read it before using  RIPEM.   RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent  residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README  file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a  product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping  distribute it.   RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \\\"home site\\\" on  ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the  U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out  how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file  GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are  available here in addition to the full source tree.  3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?   Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of  Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to  Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice  Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports  are expected, and help of users is invited.  4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?   Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend  on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users  guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM  with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.  Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU  Emacs.   If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one  in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,  and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.  5)  What is RSA?   RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means  that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to  decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,  you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your  decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public  key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to  decrypt it.  Note that the \\\"message\\\" sent with RSA is normally just  the DES key to the real plaintext. (See \\\"What is DES?\\\")   Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For  originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of  origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message  (See \\\"What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\\\") is encrypted with the  sender's private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving  authority, can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm  that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.   RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who  invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography  in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information  also may be in sci.crypt.  6)  What is DES?   DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or  secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to  encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.   RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts  your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the  recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,  allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.   DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a  key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it  should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large  corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM  standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the  near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be  stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with  interoperability.  7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?   MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.  It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,  of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not  possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a  different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,  instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,  only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.   MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example,  RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so  parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate  channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy.   MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often  used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a  passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.   MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in  RFC 1321.   There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong  a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash  function will be used if this is accepted as true.  8)  What is PEM?   PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of  encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a  working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these  documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.   RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM  specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not  handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.  9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?   For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know  your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message  received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important  that this information be accurate; if a \\\"bad guy\\\" convinces her that  his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.   RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,  the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are  described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.  None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for  key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM  is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.  10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?   This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310,  the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section  6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be  met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421  addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key  cryptography.   This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that  everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of  patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key  cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive  (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter  and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are  compressed with a patented algorithm.)  11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?   RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company  specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a  firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S.  patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:        Cryptographic Apparatus and Method       (\\\"Diffie-Hellman\\\")............................... No. 4,200,770        Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus       and Method (\\\"Hellman-Merkle\\\").................... No. 4,218,582        Cryptographic Communications System and       Method (\\\"RSA\\\")................................... No. 4,405,829        Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus       and Method (\\\"Hellman-Pohlig\\\").................... No. 4,424,414   PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key  cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for  example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.)  PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of  companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their  products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their  patents.   RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than  its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its  author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography.  However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got  interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some  people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing  code.  RIPEM even won the \\\"Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992\\\"  award.  12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?   RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography  Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the  key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as  those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys  are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were  generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.  13)  What is PGP?   PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.  PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.  PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.   A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM:   - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without    a direct network connection.   - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability    of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be    compatible with anything other than itself.   - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which    comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own    implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its    patents to \\\"make, use or sell\\\" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without    either a license or written permission.  (See: \\\"DISCLAIMER\\\")    (See: \\\"What about RSADSI/PKP?\\\")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of    PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal    action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but    it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening    in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide:     #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,     #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public    #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is    #contraband.   - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside    the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP    already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.   Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is  recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.  Unfortunately, it's not distributed separately from the program,  which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to  liability concerns.  14)  What about RPEM?   RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,  but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in  an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was  written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM.   Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many  (including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough  to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally  accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.   RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.  15)  What is MIME?   MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is  described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup  comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with  MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution  of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM  messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft  Internet documents exist on the matter.  16)  What is TIS/PEM?   Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy  Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was  rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH)  rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don't know  much more than that.  17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\",\"THE WHITE HOUSE                    Office of the Press Secretary                  (Vancouver, British Columbia)  ______________________________________________________________                          BACKGROUND BRIEFING                                BY                  SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS                             April 4, 1993                                  Canada Place                   Vancouver, British Columbia     9:40 A.M. PST                     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING  on the aid package.        SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The  President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed  yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic  and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.          Before taking your questions and running through the  basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.   First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do  with available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds  have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is  no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund  any of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently  are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin  tomorrow.              The second point is that this package is designed to  support Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package  are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have  been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian  government.              Third, the President is determined that we will  deliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed  to maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we  wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we  feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in  front of you.              Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of  trade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's  capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend  well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of  governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do  so.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make  trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.                They also agreed that there would be a new joint  commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by  Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through  the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote  a vastly expanded relationship.              If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down  the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just  give you some general background on what these programs are.   I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.              The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food  and medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has  been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian  grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure  there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the  major cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food  for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also  be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and  pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.              The second item is concessional food sales.  As you  know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship  with Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia  that we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the  Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.   The value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are  concessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out,  but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on  principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates  thereafter for the life of the deal.              The third program is a collection of private sector  support.  We think this is one of the most important things we're  going to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses  is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.   And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American  enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the  goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in  Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.                The President has also decided to create a  privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian  government in its priority objective of trying to convert state  enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has  also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a  Eurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by  prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.              The fourth grouping you see there in the summary  page is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that  this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of  pursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total  of $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed  tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're  launching.                The President is also calling for the development of  a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to  try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public  efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in  Russia.              The fifth program you see is Russian office of  resettlement.  This is a new initiative created and  conceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration  project.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military  to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic  states and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to  make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's  with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American  construction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration  basis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working  very closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say  that we have a long-term commitment to this project.                The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They  are two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our  initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the  possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and  gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in  the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much  environmental damage.              I've talked a little bit about trade and investment,  about the new group being created that the Vice President will  chair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing  with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development  committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy,  to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede  trade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time  investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this  problem full-time.                And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and  investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an  analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we  just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a  commitment within our own government to have people work on it --  senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly  important.              You'll notice that the United States is going to  support Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer  status.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested  our advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the  long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is  paramount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are  supporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting  their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.                You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in  credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended  $150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil  project.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an  agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion  framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance  Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services.  We think this is a very important development.  We think we'll  get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo  conference, the G-7 conference.              Before I take any further questions, I'd like to  defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance  objectives with you.              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major  unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts  in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and  secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory  under the terms of the START I and START II agreements.    Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important  agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding  to three important programs.  The first is the program of $130  million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement  program.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for  bomber dismantlement -- $130 million.              The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for  the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed  from the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially  contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the  construction of that storage facility.                And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help  in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear  materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we  add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance  which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall  safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety  measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the  last couple of years.                So this is an area where we will be going a lot more  work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks,  and Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last  couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for  safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian  territory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of  START I, an agreement to accede to NPT.               So we are working very hard with all the parties to  the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with  them.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia  as a very important step in that process.              Q   The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in  Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with  Kazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the  same one, why do you feel it's necessary?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same  deal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil  field.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights  oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced  today.  So it's completely new.              Q   Can you tell us more about what's involved?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like  other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do  two things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west  Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating  oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.   The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the  natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which  will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what  Russia needs.              So we think this deal is very, very good development  for Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an  American company.  And the American government has played a  leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility  in OPIC and through the loan guarantee.              Q   So it's to search and also to renovate fields  that are already there?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.              Q   On that point, should other American companies  expect to get administration support for such deals, or should  they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2  billion?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know,  Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the  U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department  and the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we  think it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th,  there will be $2 billion in financing available for American  companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.              Q   That should take up all of the rest of the  deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be  support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a  tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas  companies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and  gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will  soak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may  even extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.              Q   What's the current year budget costs of that  $2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any  current year budget costs --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer  you to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.              Q   The concessional food sales -- is there any  current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in  which the payments are due?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional  food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.   USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to  expend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd  refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.              Q   Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?              Q      and the private sector -- how many folks are  going to be involved in that?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start  with the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt  coming into office that there were literally thousands of  organization, private organizations in the United States that in  one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve  democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.   And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that  had a variety of programs in this area.  And so the  administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try  to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give  some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the  efforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.              It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will  soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in  the former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might  use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of  our own government, but the resources of the American private  sector and schools and communities across the nation.              Q      any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word  yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated  besides the $300 million the President talked about?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration  is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What  the President has done this weekend is to consult really  intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional  measures the United States could take in some of these areas to  support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he  returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other  ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.              Q   Two questions about the $700 billion  agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of  consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.   So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you  explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans  for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit  into that situation?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the  United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains  and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think  between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history  here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through  the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle  to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of  last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on  that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and  therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that  program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and  other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we  could promote American grain sales.                And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've  announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the  Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient  authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked  for a concessional loan program.                I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a  short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but  a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what  this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are  worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of  principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the  life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of  interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we  believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal  for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments  and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this  very important grain relationship, which is important for them,  and it's important for the American farm community.              Q   I gather from what you say that this could make  it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC  loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through,  is that right?               SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit  about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing   the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program  because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you  know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around  $640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having  taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American  market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to  respond to a specific request from the Russian government for  major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the  grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there,  we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to  great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with  the Russian government and arrived at this solution.                I think the Russians are pleased because it provides  them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on  the short-term payments.              Q   Where do those funds actually come from?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the  Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's  authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do  not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want  to make that general point again:  Everything in this package,  the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been  allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration  can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very  important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year,  that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be  able to do so.              Q   How did you arrive at the figure of $700  million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually  have a range from 0 to --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason  for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us  that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and  harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the  shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the  harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the  same level of food imports from the West.              Q   I would imagine there's going to be some  considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other  republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.   Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for  the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with  some of the other republics?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very  conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending  American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet  Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the  area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that  you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and  roughly 50 percent to the other countries.               In the area of food sales, we have been active with  Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We  will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this  summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the  other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are  productive and they're hard-hitting.              Q   Has anything happened at the summit to lead  American energy companies and other companies to believe that  Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of  taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our  primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not  only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd  like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're  convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to  support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of  Western governments have the financial resources over the next  decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private  sector can do that.                We look at our own society and we see tremendous  capability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very  good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial  investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new  technology and new capital to finance new production.                That's what the Russian government has told us it  wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis  on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on  the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently  last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President  Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong  signal to the American business community that we support their  efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex- Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to  support them.              Q   My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to  deliver on making Russia a more --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I  would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr.  Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas  sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice  President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the  barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil  and gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that  committee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to  the work.              Q   What type of mechanism is already in place to  administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will  the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of  the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the  Russian government for distribution at their will?                   SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking  about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the  program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working  through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure  that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to  the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the  Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can  account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of  months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of  these programs.              But they are all quite different.  For instance, in  the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it  is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of  the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working  through Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the  housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers,  we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the  democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian  private individuals and private foundations.  We're working with  journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have  noticed.              So we literally have here 30 to 40 different  activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be  carried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the  Russian government, some with Russian citizens.              Q   The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and  on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the  President has to do on that?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George  noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in  the relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's  fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we  return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and  we'll get back to the Russian government.              Q   You were not prepared for these questions when  you got here?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared  for these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not  prepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require -- let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require  consultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with  the American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those  concerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before  we take any action.              Q   Is this package designed so that you will not  have to go to Congress for anything at this point?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the  beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all  the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.   So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to  seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In  effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the  agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And  that's the advantage of this particular initiative.              Q   If this, as the President says, is a long-term,  long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment  heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to  Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are  prepared to go to Congress for various things?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been  clear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with  President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American  funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a  major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by  Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that  delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.   And we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where  it stands now.              Q   We've been told repeatedly that a number of  these items represent different or new ways of spending the money  already appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these  items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways  that it was not previously set to be?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've  said that these are all projects that either Congress had  allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were  some funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this  administration took office and had some new ideas about how the  funds might be expended.              We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or  the FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations -- Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to  further our programs.              And example of that is the Food for Progress  concessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of  funding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we  looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American  market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we  found it.              Q   Where, for example, are you getting the money  for this Russian officer resettlement --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the  Freedom Support Act funds.              Q   In other words, all of the money is being  directly spent in new ways, so to speak --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant  projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the  second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if  you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that  total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act  funding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year  '92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the  legislative history of those funds.              Q      cooperation --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I  don't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.              Q   Could you tell us please, has anything happened  here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and  Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's  happened here --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents,  President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this  issue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security  and arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's  session.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly  reinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been  talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple  of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the  discussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very  important negotiation that's been going on essentially between  Moscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially  discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute  to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.                But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend,  I don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.              Q?     Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is  any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current  year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been  earmarked and put it into this fund?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and  mirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We  could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included  out-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to  many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the  privatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already  talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.                We could have put in really big numbers and this  could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:   This package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're  going to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President  feels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy  that the western governments, the combination of governments, put  up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not  able to meet them, we're determined, and the President is  determined, to carry out every single program in this package.   And we'll do it.                But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's  part of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking  for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively  support reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment  on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.              Q      taken it way from any --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.   Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds;  so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in  Russia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.              Q   In terms of funding, there is no available  monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money  somewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I  don't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the  example is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit  guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay  back within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt  problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we  looked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement  for grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and  also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers  have a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply  look for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative  authority to do it.  This program has been successful in other  areas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union,  but we thought we should now.                 Q   Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package  for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by  initiatives put forward by President Bush?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think  that's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were  appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This  administration took office and inherited some obligations that  the Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven  week review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments  that had been made by the previous administration.                But we have gone well beyond them in funding the  enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not  been filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to  it.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them  into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say,  is another Clinton initiative.                Further, we listened to the Russian government and  listened to the Russian military who told us that the  resettlement of their officers was important to them for  political and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton  has responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment  that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out  a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.                I would also say that the President has given  impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly  about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we  have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends  itself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the  creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative,  we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private  sector as well as the American government, to achieve that  objective.                So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And  as most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the  last administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last  administration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton  assistance package for Russia.              Q   There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the  past has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this  outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money  will not just disappear because it's being administered by the  Russian government?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I  know that the President and other senior officials of our  government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and  that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's  intended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the  State Department will take great care in making sure that the  funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their  source.              I would not that this package is not simply a  package of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of  these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are  going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals,  with businesses.  The private enterprise support is another  example of that.              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add  a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one  area that we've been looking at very, very closely is  consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting  for these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely,  of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime  contractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of  a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that  funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in  Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent  efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.              Q   When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly  when do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President  is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think  it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over  the next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties  on May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over  the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach  out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us  to help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said  that we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate  in a much more effective way the activities of our own  government.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in  Russia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw  them together and to focus their efforts.              Q   Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will  actually be spent in the United States by American made goods?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any  figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something  up in the next couple of days on that.              Q   This figure is larger than the figure that has  been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result  of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think -- unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and  I'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put  us to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was  briefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the  intellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of  the ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we  had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have  been refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week  going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in  Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.   And so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been  together for about two weeks.              Q   Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There  was so much talk before about the President wanted to get  Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.   Is that in the out years?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.   President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance,  that support for the creation of private businesses is important  to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is  important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize  the state industries is important to them.                And so what we did was to try to make those the  centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We  listened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been  working with the Russian government for months on this trying to  work out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of  these programs was involved every step of the way.                But let me get at the other part of your question.   The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader  set of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking  for his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the  table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in  housing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to  consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other  allied governments that are also active.              Q   There's essentially nothing that happened in  the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that  you came in with?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular  package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks  ago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on  the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've  primarily talked about future, about what more the United States  and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia,  which is our base objective here.              Q   I noticed that you -- that money appropriated  to train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me  what about job training for workers who are displaced by  privatization?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we  have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and  financial services in the United States.  Part of the housing  initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain  Russian officers who are retiring into other professions.              Q      money for job training for workers whose  jobs are disappearing because of privatization --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet  allocated any money for that.              Q   Why not?              Q      of the $6 million is going to build 450  housing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the  Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do  housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework  of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've  got to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think  about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also  retraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming  out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.   We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers  as well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian  government.              Q      of the $6 million will go to retrain --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.              Q   Are you talking about apartment buildings or  single --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about  single, individual dwellings.              Q   You're saying that only 450 families will be  served by this?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I  thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.   What we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the  Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building  housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with  a huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next  couple of months and try to figure out with American  organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job  done.                I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.   And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into  this in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to  spend the money wisely.              Q   What is it about this program that convinces  you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be  in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back,  especially considering their other debt problem?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think  it's important to note that the United States on its own does not  have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.   It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to  our allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what  the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We  can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do  so, which is consistent with our national interests.              Q   Did the President say that the value of the  U.S. contribution was that it would create security and  prosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this  program that does this?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to  go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia,  and that is we want to do everything we can to support the  continuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay  in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear  forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction,  which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in  Russia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that  this program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we  have to make a long-term commitment to it.              Q   And then on the question of Russia's ability to  repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15  years from now?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian  government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping  is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve  their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency  revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years  from now to pay back those loans.              Q      substantial government-to-government loan  we've ever gotten into with the Russians?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to  answer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years  on this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because  the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to  just ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of  effort.              Q      government loans in any other sector that  you recall?  I know it wasn't done in --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair  to say this is a new and unique effort.\",\"  The problem is that the pins in the ADB connector  are close to each other, and if you happen to bend the cable a little while inserting it, you short the ADB port.

With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land.     \\\"There is a fear - a real fear, too,\\\" said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette. \\\"We have one generation to do it or to die.\\\"     Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land. But for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.     Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where \\\"historical sites\\\" are sometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three Zoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians, Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the Zoroastrian prophet.     Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are  a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a people is very much on their minds.     Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they actually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children become totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than the world at large - who will be the losers.     \\\"It's important to have an identity,\\\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose, a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \\\"It's important for everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life. You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect. You can fall back on your own identity.\\\"     For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.     Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was only one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.  _Good vs. evil_     Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with the good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity, kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.     But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to follow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact, Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths, traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of Mount Hamilton, is \\\"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\\\"     So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India, where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape persecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy; the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.     About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India and Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state where others had no rights.     Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \\\"good deeds\\\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose, the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because Manou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.     The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an Iranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples in North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount Hamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto, and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on this continent.     Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the property already had a large house that they have converted to a community center.     The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet  Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted  ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.     Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are  sometimes called \\\"fire worshippers,\\\" they actually consider fire just  a symbol of God.  \\\"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the  cross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\\\" Bhujwala said.     The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all Iranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With Zoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.    For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people came to worship and revel.     \\\"The good things in life are not forbidden,\\\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani, a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed proved him right.     Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit and nuts.     Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \\\"People eat the fruit,\\\" Tarapore said.  \\\"It's a way to participate in the ceremony.\\\"  _Santa Claus, sort of_     The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white hair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green symbolic of spring) and red.     He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and played a tambourine.     The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \\\"This is all new for us, too,\\\" one told a visitor who asked what was going on.     A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his people's religion.     But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the San Jose temple whenever he can.     \\\"When I first heard about this religion,\\\" he said, \\\"I thought, my God, this is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.     \\\"People who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's the difference with the lower

A single chip micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only costs about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell, use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want to try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut you a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.  If you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of  maybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than  you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add a power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count screams up to 9.  PD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros.  This application is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the  programmer's guide and create the binary with a hex editor.  John\",\"Does one exist, who makes it, and how much?

The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season.  Roster move:  Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill  Injuries:  Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes  Dominic Roussel  Game Summary:  I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts I didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by a few things I did pick up:  First Period:  Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51  Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp) Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda, Har (interference) 18:43  Second Period:  Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00  Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09  Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38 Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski, Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50  Third Period:  Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)  Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11  Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38 Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30  Overtime:  Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15. Penalties - None  Power Play:  Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4  Goalies:  Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)  Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)  On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off.  The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.  The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie.  On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner, Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play.  That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored, much less how.  From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy  Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark. But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????  What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...  #1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey next season.  #2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour, and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.  #3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season. Not a tough choice.  Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.  Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman in years to come.  Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome, he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year.  Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total. But consistency became a problem for him.

They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as many goals as they allowed, 319.  The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.

Maybe they're just UNLUCKY.  If a rapist pulls a woman into an alley in Boston, chances are almost certain that she won't be counted  as one of those self-defenders because our local constabulary didn't consider it important that she be allowed to arm herself.  Even though the shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the \\\"gun owner\\\" column.   Ironic words for somebody who lives in Florida.  The \\\"average threat level\\\" in Florida has been REDUCED by a liberal CCW policy.  It's well known that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because  they are less likely to be carrying than your natives.  Come on up to Boston, or NYC, or Washington DC, and see how much diddlysquat the  \\\"average threat level in the country\\\" means to a resident there.   Sometimes this works.  Sometimes it just lands your good neighbors  on the dance card for the next wave of drive-bys.  Someone here once told a story about LA gangs moving into Phoenix.  I've misplaced the original text, but the story started with one resident calling the  cops on a gang member.  Sure enough, a few nights later, there was a  drive-by performed at the resident's house.  Except that this time, unlike in LA, the entire street came out and returned fire, putting an end to the car's occupants.  The gang packed up and left.  Of course, in LA, or in a place like Florida after the hurricane, your first problem is to FIND an officer to step up to and tell anything.   Look, nobody is arguing this.  I have a fire extinguisher at home.   That doesn't mean I can be careless about tossing my burnt matches  on the carpet.  I live carefully, monitor the woodstove, get my flue cleaned twice a year, and test my smoke alarms annually.  But if -- DESPITE all this -- a fire does start, it's too late for any of these things EXCEPT the extinguisher.   You seem to be agreeing with your opponent.  You can't trust your government to protect you from abusers and violators -- white-collar, blue-collar, epauletted, or tank-shirted.  Ultimately, no one has the power to enforce your \\\"rights\\\" but you.  Unless you've given up that  power.   Too many people fit that category, that is true.  Some of us like to believe that they are uninterested in the facts behind the case for gun  ownership because they've been conditioned to believe that there AREN'T  any.  You seem content to underestimate the electorate; I'm willing to try to raise their consciousness.   I think we can.  HCI was founded in what, 1980?  In the mid-80's, they ran a \\\"One  Million Strong!\\\" campaign for two years before reaching this goal.   My understanding is that they \\\"reached\\\" it by the stratagem of including wide classes of people other than dues-paying members.  (I can't speak authoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they started running a \\\"Two Million Strong!\\\" campaign for a while -- but they let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they simply were never going to reach that level of membership.  In 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting point of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.   By 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had  about a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it the third largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA). And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historical figures from Kukla's \\\"Gun Control,\\\" pp. 61 and 420.)  As you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused by their T-bones and MTV.  That leaves hard-core gun-owners against  hard-core gun banners.  I know a number of ex-HCI members who have recently become NRA members. I've never heard of a single one who has gone the other way.  Yes, I think we can and will win this one.

And yes, if they pierced you with the needles you probably should have protested.   euclid  \",\"     Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.    Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be, and isn't.     I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement.   First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ  could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the  male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.   Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.   Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option.   I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\",\"Note that if you get the external CD300 for your Centris or Q800 you will miss out on the sound mixing feature unless you are willing to run a wire from the motherboard sound input connector to the stereo output on the CD.

It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists  conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques.        Intuitive Graphic Interface   Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and  point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast.  This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image  layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.        Image Format Compatibility   Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.        Image Analysis & Processing   For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution  product or principal component analyses. An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions.        Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis   Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.). The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation, and 3-D image projection.        Easy External Program Interfacing   Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions.        Quick Quality Presentation   Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images, graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as  histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers.  Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external  graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?        Software Support & Development    Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)  of the Universite de Lille, France. The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features on-line help, is supported by an Internet address   sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and  version updates provided without delay.        Performance Tested    CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data  collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today, the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center and is widely used in many French laboratories, including the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure , Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire  de Meteorologie Dynamique.      A TEST VERSION OF SPHINX IS AVAILABLE AT loasil.citilille.fr    (134.206.50.4) anonymous (bin : cd SPHINX : get ALL_SPHINX.tar.Z)     IN THE TEST VERSION THE OUTPUT FILES ARE DISABLE.

It fails for several reasons :  1) You have edited out the context of the action under discussion.  2) I never brought the legal definition up. I use the English language and not the legal dialect. The legal definition of fraud changes from one country to another in any case. The context of the discussion is morality of censorship.     You are extrapolating from the statement I made concerning a circumstance in which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the Teel case. If you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you thought me you would have done rather better. The mode of argument I was using was a form of rhetoric. Argument by example, I describe a wide set of circumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they do not apply, thus the action is not permisable.  Obviously a company posting from a University adress would be squashed,  it would be contrary to the internet comercial use.   Now you are clutching at straws. In the context of the discussion it was the fact of association between the company and the post that was important. The typeface etc is inconsequential.    If you are implying that I am lying I suggest you read Mark Holohan and Ulick Staffords posts into soc.culture.british. If you are suggesting that  advocating murder is a trivial matter I would prefer that you state it directly.   Certainly I oppose the right of Dr Sidiqui and the Ayatolah Khomenhi to call for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Incitement to murder is not part of what I consider legitimate freedom of speech.    That is irrelevant, the case is not the incremental cost but the facility cost. If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe to USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the company. It is quite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and regulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy. For example if a Microsoft employee were to post \\\"Windows NT is crap don't buy it\\\" from a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to sack that employee. In the same way if a company decides that it has  political objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political manner. This is no worse than Rupert Murdoch using his papers as a political platform for his views.    ah yes you did not quote them, merely refered to them.    Your article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment, your signature and pretty well damn all else.     Are you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments on the substantive case?  The initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable judgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be harmed would be grounds for prior restraint. The second set of hearings on the substance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets act could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already. The part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate.  Here again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that information is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated to third parties. The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this case as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves.   The crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law. The censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government's ludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book.     Funny I saw that as a rejection of an assertion that you had made. Of course in rejecting an assertion I have to make a contrary assertion, since this assertion is unprovable I left it at that.   So far I have not seen you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to your own. You are attacking my anti-censorship view because I dare to accept the validity of some pro-censorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions.  Plus I am not an absolutist. I have this funny idea that the solution to this problem was not decided in 1789 by a group of white male gentry in secret session and sumarized in a single line. Furthermore I don't think that the issues are half as simple as you imply.   I don't think that you have geered your discourse to any audience save that of proving that you are the only person wearing a white hat. \",\" Oh, *really*???   I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed seperately on my pay stub.

I haven't had a chance to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private system had support within statistical noise.  The Decima polls are considered definitive.

Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.

God's will can never be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  Jesus came to this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  If the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this cup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men and women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes. Is Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification was NOT the will of GOD.  God's will was that the Jewish people accept Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on the earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish people expected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what kind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very different world.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that age could have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on the earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would have continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to live with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to wait for Christ's return.  But when he returns will he be recognized and will he find faith on this earth.  Isn't it about time for his return.  It's been almost 2000 years.  Mike    And the two simplest refutations are these:  (1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded \\\"impact\\\" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.\",\": >What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost? : Since the Quadra is the only Mac able to deal with 5MB/s and Hard drives START : at 160MB I have NO idea. : For the Mac I have the following {These are ALL external} :  20MB $299 {$15/MB} :  52MB $379 {$7.3/MB} :  80MB $449 {$5.63/MB} : 120MB $569-$639 {$4.75-$5.33/MB : 210MB $979-$1029{$4.67-$4.90/MB} : 320MB $1499-$1549 {$4.68-$4.84/MB} : 510MB $1999-$2119 ($3.92-$4.31/MB} : etc  I thought you might want the latest prices:  As of MacWeek 4/12/93:    Meg:   Int   Ext   20M - couldn't find one available.   42M - $159  $219   85M - $199  $269   127 - $279  $349   170 - $299  $359  All above are quantum, low profile (1\\\") 3.5\\\" drives   240 - $369  $449   525 - $899  $979   1225- $1499 $1569 - the last three are quantum 1/2 height 3.5\\\" drives.

The dinner was instigated by the aunt of the hostess, whom I had met while visiting my wife in Galveston last October.  The dear old aunt (now  deceased) was very proud of her Jewish heritage, although not especially devout.  Her parents were both murdered in Nazi concentration camps in Austria during WWII because they were Jewish.  While conversing with her about politics, world affairs and religion, she remarked that it would  be a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to Atlanta.  Within two days of returning to Atlanta, her niece called to invite me over for dinner with her husband.  I went, not knowing really what to expect, other than stimulating conversation and fellowship.  What I got, however, was rather unexpected.  The thrust of the evening's discussion was to condemn the Reagan-Bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling  in federally funded family planning clinics, prohibiting the sterilization of minorities on welfare here and in Puerto Rico, on the ban on fetal tissue research, and against the Mexico City policy, \\\"which denies U.S. foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion.\\\"  The crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of \\\"overpopulation,\\\" rampant domestic crime, African starvation, unwed mothers, etc., on Christianity, rather on the fall of Adam.  Now, this is not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to  bring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesus and admonish me against converting to Judaism, \\\"because it involves too much study and effort.\\\"  And I did not even raise the prospect, nor try to convert them to the truth of Christ!  There was certainly no Jewish proselytism going on there.  And again, last November I toured a \\\"traditional\\\" Jewish synagogue and was subjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in general.  I realize that these are two isolated incidents, and that the best supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish, but from my experience, the modern Jew is not known for his proselytism.    --  boundary\",\"   I might suggest giving the management some more mumble time by asking the very leading question (in two or three parts)    What are your long term expectations of space market, what projects specifically are they funding by internal funds and at what levels and what competition do you expect in this  area.

It's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology, and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, the proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what exists now.      The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs, probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say) a DES keysearch machine.      As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination could acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since it would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked jodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency or organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak- nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for (say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the complaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars to build a keysearch machine for.)      How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?

I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such \\\"storys\\\" about them. OK ? Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:    -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.          It has an hightech \\\"boiler\\\" but the rest is still verry verry           conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-          powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.          If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find          a chapter about the \\\"CARNOT-process\\\" which describes how to          get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason          for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an          temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one           side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water          again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the           energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to          let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \\\"cold\\\"          steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.          And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of          energy that carnot will give them.          The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !          The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,          because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in          AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent          radioactive pollution of the environment !              -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-          Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still          verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere          around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with          the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the          metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.          This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures          up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.      -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever          possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the          years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem          at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have          1.5 mRem.

I thought you were gonna buy a BMW for its superior power and handling... \",\" I don't buy this at all. Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that would *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool.  Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ... Both Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just because his gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head  for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from  end-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by  Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall  for most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero  because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.  Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very  well, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over  Bellows' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all  those opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them. Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ...    Sure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.   I disagree. Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night.  The defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic, Nolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.   This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities, as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.   And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. Roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5, when you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of him for most of the season.   The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should they read the papers? They played 58 minutes of \\\"Burnsian\\\" hockey to shut down Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the  extra 2.  Red Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That's a guaranteed way to end the series 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ? The fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.   If you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should never have been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of work by Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped the puck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.\",\"BOOKS FOR SALE                           ================  Tally up any and all of the books you want and send me a message.

It is contagious and kills by attacking the covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose and the brain to swell up.  It is very treatable if caught in time.  There isn't much time, however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible to dying from bacterial meningitis.  Any infant with a fever who becomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where a spinal tap will show if they have meningitis.  Seizures can also occur.   It can live in the throat of carriers.

As a result, the gay population is not encouraged to develop \\\"non-promiscuous\\\" relationships.  In fact there are many roadblocks put in the way of such committed relationships.  It is as if the heterosexual community puts these blocks there so as to perpetuate the claim that gays  are immoral.  \\\"My, if we allowed gays to marry, raise children ... we might just find out they're as moral as we are, can't have that can we?\\\"   Just some thoughts.

Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was   trying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210   and my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need   to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe   place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is   that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it   wrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this   could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.    It could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one   wrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further   correct actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also   my NeXT that way.  Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any   problem, and at pretty high speeds too.  I don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is   pretty standard.\",\"  The Leafs have always been kind of comical.  During the second  Imlach era, when Darryl Sittler was called a \\\"cancer on the team\\\", he tore the C off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain.  Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly captaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead, Sittler got traded to Detroit.  Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and they took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago.  During Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach, in an  attempt  to  kiss the  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman, the Leafs took the A away from Brad Marsh to give to Leeman.  Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  tried to give it back to Marsh, he wouldn't take it neither.  The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late of the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably one of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  of playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be- came the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a captain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the players.  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  making sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.   -- \",\"This is a two-sided problem.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.       WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE      Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     \\\"scooped\\\" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study, Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:         Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year    Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year    Shuttle sources:   725,000 kilograms/year      The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \\\"the bends\\\", certainly some     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,     you're dying. The limits are not really known.

HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED      The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin     team's medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team     examined them, they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE \\\"FACE ON MARS\\\"      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

However, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against muslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and open hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know that historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone by the death penalty.  My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the law of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy.  I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \\\"fasad\\\". This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.   I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book. However, the charge of \\\"fasad\\\" can encompass a number of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the \\\"crisis\\\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people, not books.  The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz, presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred.  Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this point that the fatwa on \\\"fasad\\\" was issued.  The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The crime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being played out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\",\"      You're being too generous to the communists, I think.  In practice, communism has \\\"solved\\\" the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_ productive, and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the rest of the group is a bunch of sluggards.  The mass butchery of \\\"kulaks\\\" in the USSR is a good instance of this.     A poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to which people of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee.  I often wonder just what Castro would have done if the Cubans presently in Miami would have been forced to remain in Cuba.  Would they have revolted and killed him off, or been killed?     Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in, load it up so heavily with attack dogs, barbed wire, and land mines that most people fleeing over it die, and then give everyone the choice of obedience, prison, or flight.  This would be a bad science-fiction novel, if the East Germans hadn't actually done it.  The last person to die crossing the wall, as I recall, was an unarmed woman who was shot in the back.  Erich Honecker was going to go on trial for that, but he fled to socialists in Chile.

Alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre.  Besides the  numbers don't count.  National league pitchers are much better pitchers.

[Quotations omitted.  This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]  There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the \\\"Annunciation\\\" by Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28   And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto  a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a  man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's  name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\\\"Hail,  thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed  art thou among women.\\\"_  Now, now, hold that line of thought - \\\"the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women\\\" - while you read on....  In the book, \\\"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of Devotion to Mary\\\" by Peter Lappin:  The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible that the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title \\\"The Conception of Saint Anne\\\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary is the incorruptible timber \\\"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christ's sinless body\\\"; she is \\\"God's Eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\\\"  Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus, she was hailed as \\\"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\\\". ... At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a  greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_. ...  Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. From \\\"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\\\" by John A. Hardon:  Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism. Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).  Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall: In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over: -They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the  power to think and to choose freely. -The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality  and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. -They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,  the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding  title to enter heaven. By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely.  Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day...  Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ (I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):  Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born  AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was: \\\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst women\\\".  Even Mary was confused about this greeting.  Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (Adam and Eve before their sin):     Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)     Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)     The Lord is with you (At those times, God would                 definitely want to be with those He                 has made _blessed_)     Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)  At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body of Christ and so,  Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart. \",\"  What I was talking about was using an Tek terminal as your X display.

The FBI and the BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their stupidity and lies.      Now before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as  a bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.  They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet,  whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into town on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and  wondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers. First, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they didn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got it.  After the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were coming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that. Well, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.  Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to them they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised Koresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                   The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he  \\\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out. His grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise David Koresh.\\\"  Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a logical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.  Here's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must be done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?  I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how much money this was costing.  That was the start of the \\\"Justification\\\" part part of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.  But, back to the plan.  It is considered \\\"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\\\" to execute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.  They knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not sure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the  compound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.  I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR (Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were subjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical  agent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.  I have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of thing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.  We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these people 51 days.    I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole thing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks changed my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:  \\\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\\\"  It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.  One more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic weapons on the premises.                                                                 HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!  THEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!  Still, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him. For all of this my President takes full responsibility.  What a guy! I hope he gets it.                               \",\"As I won't be able to make the Joust this summer (Job related time  conflict :'^{   ), I plan instead on going to the Rider Rally in  Knoxville.

We don't know if it actually applies to reality, we don't know if anything in the world is infinite.   You don't know if the universe is actually continuous. Continuum is another mathematical concept (based on infinity) used to explain things in a certain way.   I have a pretty good idea of what infinity is. It's a man-made concept, and like many man-made concepts, it has evolved through time. Ancient Greeks had a different understanding of it.   Precicely. We don't even know if infinity applies to reality. \",\"Read this through once or twice.  Then replace \\\"prince\\\" with \\\"government\\\" or \\\"president\\\", as appropriate, and read it again.    [From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by Daniel Donno.]   In order to keep their lands secure, some princes have disarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against themselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have destroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular circumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself will allow.   To begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince disarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal, while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all, nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties and dangers should receive advantages.     When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by showing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you. Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful subjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired state has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is full of examples proving that this is so.   But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire it; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to his original domain.   ...\",\"     1.

Second, I disagree with the Pen's weak spot being defense and goaltending - for a couple of reasons.  Barrasso has had a spectacular year - no slow start, consistently sharp, GAA < 3.0, and  leads the league in wins.  Tommy deserves the Vezina.  Given the lack of  respect he commands, though, I doubt he will win it.  The other reason  concerns the Pens' team defense.  They are hovering around 3rd or 4th in the fewest goals allowed.  That is a big improvement for them, and it indicates that they are playing better team defense.   We'll see.

I was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this film for handling infectious diseases (and similar toxic substances). Clearly they \\\"faked\\\" a lot of the computer & robotic technology; certainly at the time it was made most of that was science fiction itself, let alone the idea of a \\\"space germ\\\".    Quite coincidentally [actually this is what got me wanted to see the movie again] I watched a segment on the otherwise awful _How'd They Do That?_ dealing with a disease researcher at the CDC's top lab.  There was description of the elaborate security measures taken so that building will never be \\\"cracked\\\" so to speak by man or nature (short of deliberate bombing from the air, perhaps).  And the researchers used \\\"spacesuits\\\" similar to that in the film.  I'm curious what people think about this film -- short of \\\"silly\\\". Is such a facility technically feasible today?

John McKay vax2.concordia.ca \",\" Every city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in the last two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though I haven't seen any Glock's).   With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a  large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand him and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something  like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that \\\"different is good\\\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in  more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a certain \\\"propriatory nature\\\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to  learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.   Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.    I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time.    Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off.   The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always  take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later).     Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).     All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and  shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.   Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.   I think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it's a small one B^)).   I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.    9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the street cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry the \\\"Highway Patrolman\\\".   Vincent, please don't take any of this as a flame.  Just my $0.02 (whoops, looks more like $2.00) worth.  And much of it is IMHO, but do check Ayoob's book.\",\" While I don't read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar information (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..  I bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles) after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude,  and Celica.  Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.    My criteria: a \\\"fun\\\" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K. I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out. The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag. Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS). The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy. The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.   I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me. The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went. The Celica was \\\"ok\\\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat overpriced too) in non-turbo form. I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it for its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind. I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more. Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)  The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its reliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:  My dislikes: Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal. Headlights have \\\"stuck\\\" up a few times (weather?) air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch) condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely. crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical) parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical). assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not  stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke. Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies! Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when I bash my head on the corner. horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference) Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car   My Likes: engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1 handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits) transmission (the 5 speed is a must) usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere) Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive) stability at 100+mph (high gearing though) low cowl (good visibility in front) Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather) ABS/Air bag (see above) rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important) No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!) Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)  As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.    The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a  potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable. If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently (if that's \\\"better\\\" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass around you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with the heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine. Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so I can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).   I prefer cloth to leather anyway.    I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water  generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the Eagles (and I was really trying).   There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \\\"pouch\\\" but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO. And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!  Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the  water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.

The region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and Ossetia, but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former Soviet Union to fight for independence.  Lezghis, who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about the conscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared war with Armenia.  They also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia, which were effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national borders that had been only lines on a map.  A rally of more than 3,000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription and demand a separate \\\"Lezghistan\\\" alarmed the Azerbaijani government.  Officials in Baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot six demonstrators to death. But the government announced strict security measures and began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of Lezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.  Visitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon after the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.  At the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a war they say is not theirs.  \\\"I have been drafted, but I won't go,\\\" said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth glinting in the sun. \\\"Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have nothing to do with Armenia.\\\"  More than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.  Malik Kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 locals drafted in 1992 had served.  \\\"The police don't force people to go,\\\" he said. \\\"They are afraid of an uprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan.\\\"  All the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but disagreed on how the protest came about.  Some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was about to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.  Others said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the Lezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan.  \\\"We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about draft orders,\\\" said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval.  \\\"We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis,  the Russians.\\\"  In the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties, in what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.  By 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they came under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the  600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.  About half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan.  \\\"We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine,\\\" complained Mais Talibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar, included brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan.  \\\"We want our own country,\\\" he said. \\\"We want to be able to move about easily. But Baku won't listen to us.\\\"  Physically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other Azerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same  jobs and intermarrying to some degree.  But the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and Persian with strong guttural vowels.  Azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest ethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary  school classes in their language.  Autonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from Azerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the  Talish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern Azerbaijan.    \",\":  [ . . . . . ] : : Personally, I feel that since religion have such a poweful : psychological effect, we should let theists be.

Because our society has driven into us that religion is ok to preach, non-religion should be self contained. What a crock of shit. I finally told my sister that I didn't find her way of life attractive. I have seen exactly 0 effort from her on trying to convert me since then.

In this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd, then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache.  The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then it is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.  My experience tells the second method is relible.  Hope this helps.\",\"Source: \\\"Men Are Like That\\\" by Leonard Ramsden Hartill. The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Indianapolis (1926). (305 pages).

I will oblige.  My name is Elias Davidsson, Icelandic citizen, born in Palestine. My mother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables' (at that times this group was defined as 'Jews'). She was forced to go to Palestine due to many  cynical factors. I have meanwhile settled in Iceland (30 years ago) and met many people who were thrown out from my homeland, Palestine, because of the same reason (they belonged to the 'indesirables'). These people include my neighbors in Jerusalem with the children of whom I played as child. Their crime: Theyare not Jews. My conscience does not accept such injustice, period. My work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism and racial discrimination. Those who protest against such practices in Arab countries have my support - as long as their protest is based on a principled position, but not as a tactic to deflect criticism from Israel. The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.  The Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activities undertaken under my guidance in different domains, and which command the support of many volunteers in Iceland. It is however not a formal institution and works with minimal funds.  Professionally I am music teacher and composer. I have published  several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe.

In the US that means NASA.  If you have basic information requests: (e.g., general PR info, research grants, data, limited tours, and ESPECIALLY SUMMER EMPLOYMENT (typically resumes should be ready by Jan.  1), etc.), consider contacting the nearest NASA Center to answer your questions.  EMail typically will not get you any where, computers are used by investigators, not PR people. The typical volume of mail per Center is a multiple of 10,000 letters a day.

Even if it were possible, I think it is a bad idea since it smacks real strongly of double jeopardy.  A civil case for damages is fine since that is a trial that would proceed regardless of the first.  I think a bad precedent has already been set in the King trial in L.A. and something like this would make it worse.  Regardless of how bad anybody feels about this decision, it must stand that charges of assault were not not proven against the three marines and that's how it should stand.

Since there is a lot of crossover between gamers and science fiction and fantasy fans, I will mention that I am the editor and publisher of RADIO FREE THULCANRA, a Christian-oriented science fiction fanzine.  It is not a Christian magazine with a special interest in science fiction.  It is a science fiction fanzine with a special interest in Christianity.  Gaming is not a major topic of discussion but it has come up in some letters.  (No, there are no arguments about whether D&D is satanic.  People who think it is are not likely to be reading RFT.)  Anyway, I am now working on the April issue.  I will send a sample copy to any reader of soc.religion.christian who requests it.  It is printed on paper, so requests should include a snail-mail address. ------- Marty Helgesen Bitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu\",\"The  following  jazz  magazines  will  go for the best            OFFER  received.

The JNF offered a premium deal, so the owners took advantage of it.   It's called commerce.

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.  Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch.  That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game, Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about  winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch.  Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible.  Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games.  I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.  But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan.    -- The Beastmaster   \",\"Is there a fast 'n dirty way to kill the line spiking that occurs when an inductive load is turned on sometime other than at zero-crossing of the AC cycle?

As for how foods taste:  If I'm not allergic to MSG and I like the taste of it, why shouldn't I use it?  Saying I shouldn't use it is like saying I shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor has an ulcer.  People have long modified the taste of food by additives, whether they be chiles, black pepper, salt, cream sauces, etc.  All of these things cloud the flavor of the food.

I will attempt to construct a facsimile of what was previously said, and  then address Kermit's offering.  John Redelfs originally wrote...    jr> I learned that a man cannot frustrate justice by repenting on his   jr> death bed because repentance is more than a feeling of remorse.  It   jr> requires faith in Christ proven by following him, by keeping his   jr> commandments.  Such cannot be accomplished on ones deathbed.  Tom Albrecht responded...    ta> So Jesus must have lied to the thief on the cross.  John Redelfs wrote back that...    jr> Paradise and salvation are not the same thing.  Salvation is better.   jr> Refer to John 14:2.  I responded to John that...    rw>    I don't see the effort to equate salvation with paradise.   rw>   rw>    Rather, I see implied the fact that only those who are saved   rw> may enter paradise.  To which Kermit wrote...  kt> Incomplete reference: kt> kt> See also the discussion: Did Jesus go into Hell in the BibleStudy group kt> for the arguments that Paradise and Hell(sheol) are places after death kt> The discussion (no LDS were involved as far as I could see) argued using kt> standard Christian argument from the Bible that pretty much support the kt> LDS position. kt> kt>    Christ went to paridise after his death and burial. kt> kt>    He taught the prisoners and freed them from Darkness. kt> kt>    When he was resurrected, he had not yet ascended to his father. kt> kt> The arguement centered around what was or wasn't the proper biblical kt> terms for those places.       I respond.       The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise      before entering into heaven. No one has made a point for or against       that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox      belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16),       the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).       The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent      on their death bed. Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was      contradictory to what John's position put forward. The thief on the       cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of       the righteous dead. John's position possibly needs to be reworked.      Kermit needs to address the topic at hand.\",\" I totally agree.  Really, the only people this is going to benefit, are those who live in the cities where the train stops.

They include the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli, the fact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people, and the historical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem.   When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948, the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit religious shrines.  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan, who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  The Jordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned a Jewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in their latrines.   Israel has allowed individuals of all religions into Jerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness to control the city.   Also, I should point out that Islam is not centered in Jerusalem, but has holy sites there.  The home of Islam is Mecca, where all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).  Unlike Israeli Jerusalem, Jews and Christians are not allowed in Saudi Mecca.

(AP) -- A police officer afraid he would be fired for allegedly assaulting a teen-ager walked into an auto body shop wher the youth worked, said \\\"You're going to die\\\" and fatally shot him and two others, police said.  A fourth youth was wounded.  A fifth escaped injury by hiding under a car.  The wounded youth ran about two blocks to a house after the shooting at about midnight Tuesday and called police.  He was hospitalized in satisfactory condition Wednesday.

In this configuration, X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.     The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables.

Around a million Americans every year defend themselves with firearms.  In many of these cases the defender doesn't even have to fire a shot!  The mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the deterrent that is needed.  I don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  But, taking away the right of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent crime problem in this country.  If honest, law-abiding citizens are unable to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will be able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling guns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns should be banned by the Klintonistas.   Statistics, por favor?   See my previous post.  That ought to set you straight.   People have the right to keep and bear arms no matter what the Constitution says.  That means that even if the 2nd Amendment is repealed the *people* (that's all American citizens FYI) will *still* have the right to keep and bear arms.

I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment      before the white throne. Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate. They cried for the rock and the mountains. They prayed, but their prayers were too late. The soul that had put off salvation,  \\\"Not tonight I'll get saved by and by.  No time now to think of ....... religion,\\\"  Alas, he had found time to die. And I saw a Great White Throne.  Now, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for motivation, yet Jesus thought it was.  Paul thought it was.  Paul said,  \\\"Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.\\\"  Today, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don't tell people anymore, that there's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.    As Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a place called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to experience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we can to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going to \\\"outer darkness.\\\".    Jesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He prepared it for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere, that God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the elect are the \\\"whosoever will\\\" and the nonelect are the \\\"whosoever wont's.\\\"  Whether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but its practical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, \\\"Ye would not.\\\"    Now, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be Christians.  Have you ever said to somebody, \\\"I don't believe in hell.  I believe in the religion of Jesus.\\\"  But did you know that Jesus talked more about hell than He did about heaven!  \\\"Oh I believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount.\\\"  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the mount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire.  Several times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over in the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah.  Not Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God.  The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't want to see them go there.  Now, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus, not some angry Baptist preacher, that said, \\\"where the worm never dies, and where the fire never goes out.\\\"  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell a \\\"furnace of fire.\\\"  It was Jesus that used the word, \\\"condemnation.\\\"  \\\"And this is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.    How can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?  Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about.  When my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, \\\"outer darkness.\\\"    Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not a party.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it \\\"outer darkness.\\\"  \\\"Outer\\\" -away from God.  \\\"Darkness\\\" -God is light.    No when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated Jesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As my son would say, an \\\"awesome\\\" thought.    \\\"My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?\\\"  Hell is isolation.  There's no fellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embrace in hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement in hell.    \\\"I thirst.\\\"  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it eternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, will crave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way and I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost.    In a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life ministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the illustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to Jack.  \\\"They sing these songs and read Bible verses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you think God would send me to hell?\\\"  Jack answered by saying, \\\"Yes I think he would!\\\"  Of course the barber said, \\\"What do you mean by that.\\\"  \\\"Well if you can't stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to God now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'd be miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match what you really are.\\\"   It makes a man think.  The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't ask me how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He died, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He purchased eternal life for the \\\"whosoever wills.\\\"  He suffered eternal judgment.    A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying \\\"Everybody is going to be saved eventually.\\\"  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separate them.  The sheep from the goats.  \\\".After you die there's a probationary period in which God prepares you for heaven.\\\"  No, my Bible says that \\\"It is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment.\\\"  Some of the cultist believe in annihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squished out.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven.    I don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy listening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a place called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any hope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't found it.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a God of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placed us in a \\\"uni\\\"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications.  1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others.  Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out.  \\\"Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we persuade men.\\\"  2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awful chance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if you are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and suffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its like Dirty Harry said, \\\"You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well do you?\\\"  \\\"A man's got to know his limitations.\\\"  Don't be one of the \\\"whosoever wont's.\\\"  \",\"I replied to your message, however, it is listed as a new topic with the title: \\\"rnitedace and violence\\\".

None of this sounds like a \\\"small fishing village\\\" by any stretch of the imagination.  Centuries later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had \\\"opulent and flourishing bazaars\\\" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was \\\"noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware.\\\" During the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held by Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)  In [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: \\\"other *major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and Zahlah.\\\"  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of the Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982) on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's withdrawel in 1984, \\\"Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy.\\\"  If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present, why is it always called a city (or, above, a \\\"major city\\\")?  Why does it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities in Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the list (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?

(One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also, so I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for the cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In particular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.      I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed. Don't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to  the other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make a case for Tyre having been singled out?   They had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]: Tyre \\\"receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes and from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a large series of coins, occasionally in gold ...\\\"  The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fit your characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems to have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching when you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small fishing village.   A Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low. He happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian, _Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969). The same sentence, in fact.  He defends the fulfillment of the prophecy using the same argument you are using, an argument that I haven't seen in print anywhere else, which is why I jumped to the conclusion that you were quoting Josh.  (I tried to find the Jidejian book, but it isn't listed in Books in Print.  Can you tell me more about it? Her descriptions are so much at odds with everything else I've read; I'm curious to know why.)\",\"I have a Sega Genesis (barely used) that IUd like to sell with the following games:  Sonic the Hedgehog (I) Revenge of Shinobi Thunderforce III  I'm asking $160 OBO.

When someone claimed that guerillas were manifestations of popular sentiment, the topic arose:\\\"When does a civilian stop becoming a civilian?\\\".  If he houses and shelters guerillas of his own free will, aiding them, has he violated his \\\"civilian\\\" status?   But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways? If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Afterall, Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.   That is not exactly true.  The Hizbollah and their affiliated groups have made several attempts to infiltrate the border of Israel.   True, but the Syrians did allow (until at least 1984) guerillas to operate in the areas that were under their control, provided that those guerillas were attacking Israeli lines.  The problem is that Syria is also not as stable a partner for long term peace as others in the area might be. \",\"A friend of mine is seeing an acupuncturist and wants to know if there is any danger of getting AIDS from the needles.

Ryan> Another good place for your helmet is your mirror (!). I kid you not.  This is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbing layers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer. Most helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner compacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or delaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years following his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose up to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I have a video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.  Puncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, and other relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when the comfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously degrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of \\\"parking your lid\\\" on the mirrors, I suggest you look under the comfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantly damaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet.\",\"  The problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about the Bible which they don't actually believe or practice. I've known all sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to the fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the  conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is a (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyone who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition. While I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official position of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).  The particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in terms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact  that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane  and give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this  (other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would  show them that what they claim about the Bible and what they  actually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.  While this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians, I would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this case, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually put into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and look at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying to express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the Christian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as \\\"Word of God\\\", \\\"inerrant\\\", \\\"infallibale\\\", \\\"The Manufacturer's Handbook\\\", \\\"The only rule of faith and practice in the church today\\\" to describe the Bible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at the mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably false and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even when the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical example is from the garden of Eden where God asks \\\"Where are you?\\\" and Adam explains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had answered God's words he would have said something like \\\"I'm here in this tree.\\\" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these words are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of the place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases and explanations that others use.  I hope this helps. --                                                                      ___ Bill Rea                                                            (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---\",\"I recently attended an allery seminar.

(formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the process of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0  and C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent Graphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through  June 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with  ansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge  tape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products.   X Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts:   1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types    available through a large collection of X resources. 2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers. 3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization. 4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback. 5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget     library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar     to X programmers. 6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge's UIM/X product.    This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical    layout of an application.   C Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:   1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library    is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C    standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C. 2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse     interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control    with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization. 3. Large collection of high-level application functions for \\\"two-call\\\"    graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available    with minimal programming effort. 4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling    the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot    the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can     control the event loop.

I have heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic. Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/ home use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach.  I  have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily: I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must  be different than what is the logical ordering.  To permanently reorder (to  use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records  appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order) exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach  database), and then copying the exported files back to the original  filename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really  like about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than  the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).  Paradox also  takes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12MB) and RAM).\",\" Okay, that's good.  I'm typing this from exactly the same setup.

Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography. Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something like DES) for the encryption.  How could the \\\"back door\\\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers used in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.  Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most straightforward to me.)  Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the message itself has a \\\"dual key\\\" property, that possession of either of two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from the DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.  It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early knowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with Clipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.\",\" I disagree.  People marry each other.  When they commit fully to each other as life partners, they are married.  The ceremony may assist in emphasizing the depth of such a commitment, but is of itself nothing.

However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!).  On a related topic, who is to say that \\\"color\\\" is more or less correct than \\\"colour\\\" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API terms such as \\\"XAllocColor\\\" and \\\"colormap\\\".  In a world that uses the term \\\"Windows\\\" to refer to Microsoft Windows, perhaps the time has come to accept \\\"X Windows\\\" as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say, \\\"the X Window System\\\" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it. Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short, snappy, descriptive title (\\\"X\\\" is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called \\\"Microsoft Windows\\\" or \\\"the Microsoft Window System\\\" or how about just plain \\\"Microsoft\\\"!  To summarise (or should that be \\\"summarize\\\") the point of this message: I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be \\\"windowing system\\\"). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System. \",\"I also suffer from these video \\\"artefacts\\\".

It can convert bitmaps to Corel art format.  These can then be imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap. Result - the file is completely in Corel format and can be SCODAL'ed no problem!  BUT the slight problem with this, which makes the solution less than idea, is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments.  So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to image.

I'm not trying to be    contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction    and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?    What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that    Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?    This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically    stood by the Pope.  The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This is the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his departure from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands from *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be disobeyed.  My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it would be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the present situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated. Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the Catholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.     It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is    disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over    authority and discipline.    The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic Faith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the Catholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.  There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the Catholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an hour, probably.  Take the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book on what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio de Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old catechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the Catholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He innoculated the people against what was coming.  Well, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came when the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope recovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really wanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence. The Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.  The injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop was installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's clergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New Mass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass. The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop was *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The priests would just start building new churches; the people were completely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the bishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.  The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to canon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V. Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.  During all this process, the people of Campos, not just private individuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending petitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist bishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome. Eventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.     My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)     If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.    If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and    there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that    I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end of the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in Catholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an instant non-Catholic.  The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are doing, they would be shocked!     We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\"    traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter    East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.  This isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body of traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are especially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is.     I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow    error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`    I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  That's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job since the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors spread that it's pitiful.  Infallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the short term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In fact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large sections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been much more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long run.     What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement    regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how    do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?    Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.    Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,    one way or the other.  Yes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what is he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of the Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic schools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?     It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the    Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\",\"  If anyone gets the New York Times, the Edit page has a transcript of a VHS from Hams describing their methods of torture and  execution.

Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois. ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.  The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king, who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which  the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million, His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual, seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of slots.  The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions supporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from  70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside). According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and  the Pacific Rim.   RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money. Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began  negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in  Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time. Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way that people operate.  For example \\\"everybody can sell you everything.\\\"   Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.  Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who  went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually, he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the  Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to  allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.  The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied  Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in  Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners :-)  Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is  apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them  specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their  satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They  have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place now.  Tidbits:  *  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big business because big business is just like what they have over there, except that \\\"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\\\"  *  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months.  *  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia, and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.  *  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith.  Italy gets a new government \\\"every two weeks\\\" but we don't worry  because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.  *  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting 25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \\\"equivalent\\\" value in  rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government.  *  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western  satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites, which was rather reassuring.  *  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much  shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the  difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition, shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date hardware. \",\"I sent a response to the White House at   0005895485@MCIMAIL.COM (White House)  and received a nice, automatic reply from MICMAIL noting, in passing, that if I had included a SNail address, I would get a reply in due course.

(Much thanks to Jayne K who is already supporting me with kind words and prayers!)  I've been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs.  I'm female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that on seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this company.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one; someone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.  I'm really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.  There was no note.  I do not know if it was:   - someone's idea of an innocent joke, that went awry  - someone's sick idea of flirting  - an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)  I dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question, I don't know the answer so I take a military specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a Bible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to Corinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love Association?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.  I can lock up my desk, but I can't lock up every book I have in the office.  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into my briefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home to find such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone wants to do to my body.  To make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for leaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go to the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one could be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my number was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a neutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite the fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer.  I need some prayers --- I can't stop crying. I am so deeply wounded that it's ridiculous.  I feel like I'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel like I'm a sub-human piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simple phone call saying \\\"We're leaving for Mary's lunch a little early so that Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting...\\\"  Please pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously turned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing me so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray for my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a whole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This company, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment isn't tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or threatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven times in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company do me no good when I'm terrified or healing from the latest assault.)  And please pray that I don't turn into an automaton because of this. That's my bad habit: \\\"ignore it and it will go away\\\", \\\"you're not worth anyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this\\\", \\\"you're right, you are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this way\\\", \\\"you are just an object\\\", \\\"you prostitute your mind to this company so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there as well?\\\", \\\"what makes you think women aren't just possessions, and nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\\\" This is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major depressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don't come into my head and stay there, triggering depression.  Please pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and God. In a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to God, and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesn't drop me from his loving hand, but it's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand, look down, think I'm falling and forget that God's still holding on to me.)

The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan, head of the Armenian defence ministry press centre, as saying Ankara had been sending  planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops.  It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey about the impermissibility of such actions,\\\" the journalists quoted Duliyan as  saying.  \\\"If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate measures. We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft units.\\\"  Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in the conflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in which more than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.  The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to Azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.  A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly on a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket launchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.  Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops and arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from where they were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku.  \\\"All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the country which is affording military assistance over our airspace,\\\" he said.  Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops  involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.  Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive along the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front.  \\\"The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's) leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire,\\\" the agency said.  Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in Karabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of Commonwealth leaders.  \\\"The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the protection of the Karabakh population,\\\" Tass quoted him as saying.       At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have collapsed.  \\\"The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the legal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh,\\\" he said. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not  been recognised by any other country.  Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future peace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.  Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender Gamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with Armenia, had resigned.  Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office. Khabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of Baku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev. There was no official confirmation.  \",\" a lot of batters lean in when pitches come.  rickey's crouch tends to exaggerate that, i think.  \\\"a great player to watch if you forget who he is\\\" - \\\"unbiased\\\"... hmmm...\",\"      That's true, but according to your stats, Chicago has just as good a record as Toronto.  It's interesting that you should list Toronto ahead of Chicago.\",\"-*-----   I hope Gordon Banks did not mean to imply that notions such as hard-to-see candida infections causing various problems should not be investigated.  Many researchers have made breakthroughs by  figuring out how to investigate things that were previously thought \\\"virtually impossible to test for.\\\"  Indeed, I would be surprised if \\\"candida overbloom\\\" were such a phenomena.  I would think that candida would produce signature byproducts whose measure would then set a lower bound on the  extent of recent infection.  I realize this might get quite  tricky and difficult, probably expensive, and likely inconvenient or uncomfortable to the subjects, but that is not the same as  \\\"virtually impossible.\\\"\",\"Add me to the list of bugged 230 owners.  I had a bunch of problems regarding sleep/wakeup/restart with the 230 when I first got it, both with and without the techworks ram.  Finally it \\\"died\\\", wouldn't start, until I  opened the docking door (which snaps open) and  the machine came up fine, but with the clock a few decades off.  Apple  replaced the processor board.  Now,   twice the machine has frozen (no mouse action)   twice the machine has refused to wake up.  Acutally, the backlighting     came on, and the disk spins when the power adaptor is plugged in     (but not with a good battery).     The first time this happened removing both power adaptor and battery       for ~1 minute brought the machine back.     The second time this happened the machine wouldn't wake up until       powered down for about 30 minutes.  The screen had what looked       like red horizontal lines accross it.     Both timse the file \\\"fax modem preferences\\\" has been corrupted       according to disinfectent).  I have removed all the fax and modem software, and the third party memory, and am waiting to see if it happens again.  forrest  \",\" And another survivor claims he heard someone shouting \\\"The fire's started!\\\". Odd terminology.  That's what one says when you know a fire is planned, not  when one occurs by accident.  We will have to wait and see what the evidence  shows, assuming one is willing to believe any evidence offered by the  \\\"distrustful ones\\\".   Neither.  Again I was merely addressing the sanity level of the players.   I agree that the BATF handled the affair badly from day one.  BTW, I heard  on the news today that the affadavit behind the no-knock warrant was unsealed  today.  Grenade launcher was the only thing on the list that I found  unusual.   Ambitious news reporters could use the documentary filmed by an Australian  in 1992 on the compound grounds to help identify survivors.  I, for one,  will check their stories for consistency with what I learned in a long  news story about that documentary.   Certainly there is some room for doubt.  I certainly reserve the right  to change my opinions when new evidence warrants such a change.  If I  were conspiratorially minded, however, I would never be able to change  my mind, because any evidence I disliked would have to be a lie  fabricated by the \\\"distrustful ones\\\".  \",\" I just talked to a rep for my AT&T mastercard regarding this:  There is no maximum claim, and you only have to notify them of the warranty when the  item needs repair.  If it can't be repaired, you get the amount you paid for it. Curiously though, the AT&T Gold mastercard has a limit of $1000 on claims. Definitely not upgrading to that card...:)  -Bryan \",\"  Most of the points you made about Lopez v. Berryhill/Olson have been made by others, and realizing that Lopez must be the second coming of Frank Thomas, I have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom of his supporters.   See?  This is essentially what everyone was doing  -  comparing Lopez to one of the best players in the game.  I'm really looking forward to seeing this can't-miss superstar now.  As for Thomas, I remember being an advocate of his being brought up in 1990 even though he was only 21 or 22 (can't remember).  But who did the Sox have at first? Calderon?  Martinez?  Kittle?  The spot was there.  The talent was there.  Sure, I say go for it.  I am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomas was after his AA season in 1989, and I am not convinced that Olson/ Berryhill are nearly as bad as Kittle/Martinez were.  BTW, I don't think Thomas was hurt by those three months.       Well, if we can't compare our guy to one of the best in the game, let's compare our decision to one of the most \\\"Boneshead\\\", right?  Cal Eldred was 24 when he came up, with a full season at AAA and a longer minor league career.  Frankly, I don't know why he didn't make the club in 1992.  Bones is a year younger with a lousy prior history, and just watching him makes me think that I missed a  career as a big-league pitcher.  No one -  I repeat NO ONE  - laughed louder than I did at the Sheffield trade.  (Though I guess Mieske has a future.)  (I take it back. McIlvaine may have laughed louder.)     aw, gee, shucks.  thanks guy.  except I missed the part where SDCN's admit they're wrong.    -- The Beastmaster \",\" The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.  Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple (early March).  Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is it because too many people take French and German in college to make the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance. Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.   For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.  Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.   Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care.  At that point, they wouldn't even consider a \\\"voucher\\\" approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.   It is \\\"free\\\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda.  The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer  1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For  1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance. Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.   Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.  When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's public health insurance plan.  gld\",\"I'm trying to figure out how to operate a Pioneer Laserdisc LD-1000 that I bought at a surplus store.

If the NSA comes up with the numbers, that's a trap door you could drive a truck through.   Me either.     It seems from the following that the CPSR is atleats starting to question this bogosity:      ---------------------------------------------------------------- April 16, 1993 Washington, DC                 COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC            DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE          Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today called for the public disclosure of technical data underlying the government's newly-announced \\\"Public Encryption Management\\\" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super- secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.          According to NIST, the technical specifications and the Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of such standards.          CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the so-called \\\"digital signature standard\\\" (DSS), a communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard. NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the DSS.          David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications, as reflected in today's official statement,  \\\"a step in the right direction.\\\"  But he questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  \\\"At a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation.  It is not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the development process.\\\"          CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society.

Why do you say that? It sounds like you're suggesting  Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella.      Which reports are those?      I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter. Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem.       I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners. Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.     As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak  defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have.

And to be honest as well, I believe you have not asked my god to come to you.  Why do I say this? Because by the things you write on the net, and the manner with which you write them, you show me that you made up your own god and are attempting to pass him off as the real thing.  I got news for you. Yours doesn't at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn't come to you because your god doesn't exist.   I am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind. What I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.   Be true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain  knowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the Bible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond our shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself   to seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a person who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find  something to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one will gain with that attitude is folly.  Be careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even though they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not. Be assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such deep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied.  I will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \\\"You will never be thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\\\"   From King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):      \\\"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;      to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\\\"   Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55:     \\\"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\\\"   And in John 3:16:     \\\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,    that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal    life.\\\"   You are included in \\\"whosoever\\\".  And I also pray that the Father is drawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting to talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the making.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure stoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became on of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.  You see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because you could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack Christians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul, proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.  Or you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would  probably say to you: \\\"Satan would surely like to have you.\\\"  Why so? Because Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great moments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task he did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the faith to walk on water as Jesus did.  You asked \\\"Why not believe in Zeus?\\\"  Zeus didn't offer eternal life. You got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus. \",\"Hello Netlanders:         I am a novice X user with a question for any Xgod.

I have loaded the Basic OS (which includes nsu) and        inet utilities (tcp/ip).        I ftp-ed the XFree86 (X11R5) binaries and installed properly.    I can execute startx and run X-windows with no problems.  However, if I try to access the tape drive while in X, the  machine locks up instantly.  If I am out of X and access the  tape, the tape drive works fine.  Soon as I try to  startx again; the screen changes modes, but, the grey background  pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked.  I have to login  from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system.   I've contacted Esix about this problem.  They claim THEIR X-window X11R4  server (which I have) works with the Wangtek tape drive.  They also   claim I only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run X; I don't  need inet (tcp/ip).  My experience has been that I need BOTH to get  XFree86 to work.  I'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet  packages to get X to work unless the inet package is causing my problem.

The hardware will automagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg, anything with high IRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now.     I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1 on IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of the interrupts in between. Works just great.    If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the higher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.    It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the   first IRQ serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response --  especially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no problems.

Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the faces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing the two shared vertices).  Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.  Using the edge dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face.  And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently orienting the entire surface.  Find the average of the vertices in this surface.  Using that point, calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face's orientation.  If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces are oriented correctly.  If it is negative, reverse their orientations (mark them CLOCKWISE).  If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another face and go through the algorithm again.  At the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed before facet normals are found.

Later, in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford, a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis Alicea, a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter.  What the Hell is he thinking.  Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt, But torre said he liked Gilkey coming off the bench.  Gilkey hit over 300 last year, what does he have to do to start, The guy would be starting on most every team in the league.  Furthermore, in Sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate,  The replay showed Bucky Dent the third base coach looking down the line and waving lankford home,   I can't take this anymore  brian, a very distressed cardinal fan. -- \",\"The following is available in some FTP archive somewhere, I insert my comments liberally throughout this demonic memo of Big Brotherdom:      Look!

Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring and tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on  the frontend.  Also remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm equivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets dropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly 12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.  But dropping it that far down is probably a big no-no.

I hear Vida> that pilots and steward/esses have a limit as to the maximum Vida> number of flying hours -- what are these limits?  What are the Vida> main problems associated with too many long-haul (over 4 hours) Vida> trips?  The crew rest requirements are to prevent undue fatigue.  The cockpit crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew limits for this reason.  Crew rest requirements address amount of time on duty plus rest time.  A tired crew is an accident-prone crew.  The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military aircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably pressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members DNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.  Flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear.  If you don't have big pressure changes, you may not know that you've got a problem.  But if you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an airliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem. Ears don't clear readily because of allergies, colds, infections, and anatomical problems.  The last won't change; the first three can. Medication (decongestants or antihistimines, usually) can help. Chewing gum, sucking hard candy (or a bottle for babies), yawning--these will help all four causes.  \",\"I recently had a case of shingles and my doctors wanted to give me intravenous Acyclovir.  It was a pain finding IV sites in my arms...can I have some facts about how advantageous it is to give intravenous antibiotics rather than oral?\",\"To what follows, our moderator has already answered the charge of  arrogance more ably that I could have done so, so I will confine myself to answering the charge of illogic.     This is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was, taught to think. It is the fundamental premis \\\"A is not not-A\\\". If a thing is true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic  asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word \\\"believe\\\", however. The weak sense means I am not sure. \\\"I believe Tom went to  the library.\\\" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense means I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. \\\"I believe  that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.\\\" (despite  the fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian belief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological  topics.)    Note that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the  majority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that if Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be false, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity.  (And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)    It is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless  they have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks and wants.   Most Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living tradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly by the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.   If depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we  may both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive that he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.    Thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being  can find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find  absolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who does not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.   Here I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the knowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass  is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half full: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist and the optimist express the *same* fact.)   It is, of course, quite true that different people may express the  same belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail to understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great scisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal agreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs are equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict some other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have been stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must, **necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical to say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct,  but if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long as we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other  as in error.\",\" PC Magazine, January 12, 1993 had a review of several personal finance management programe, as did PC-Computing, January 1993.  PC World, December 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money. I can email you copies of these articles if you can't find them at your library.  I've been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have several friends who use Quicken, though I've not used it myself.  My overall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager while Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your finances.  Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:   The ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:  checking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile  your account statements with the records the program keeps.   The ability to make a budget and track your spending against that  budget.   A Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill  paying service to pay your bills via your modem.    The ability to print checks on your printer.   The ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.   The ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts  up to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically  via modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I'm not sure about it.   The ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation  programs.   Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that Quicken does not:   A tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to  predict your tax liability for the coming year.  It's usefull to fine  tune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn't get his due too early.   An insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep  records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.  It can also compute your life expectancy.   A financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest,   effects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to  maturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and  loan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you   decide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford  a particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good  investment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether  a particular investment's cash flow is adequate for your situation.  This module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping  your kids with their tuition.     A net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets  and liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this   information.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules  are automatically included here.   A \\\"desk\\\" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file  you can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital  information about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a  rudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment  list, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to  track such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list  can be made to display automatically when you start the program.  There are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I'm almost sure that Quicken doesn't do everything I've listed.  If I'm wrong, I'm sure hordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.  One thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a  Windows version.  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version of Managing Your Money for release late this year.\",\"As I've mentioned in the rules posting, I will be out of town until the day before the entry deadline, so I won't be able to respond to your messages until April 18.

I was picked from my softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand, left eye) which put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  To control the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  Since I was used to slow pitch, I didn't come close (actually I think I foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of people like me in her study (i.e., those who can't hit fast pitch, or are not used to hitting off a machine),  I would seriously question the results of that study!!  I think there have been some studies of major league players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was \\\"better\\\" - but I don't know the results.  (The woman who ran the study I was in said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major leaguers than across the general population - but I'm not sure whether I'd believe

It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is  16 Mbits a second. [...]   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips  N, a 30-bit serial number  U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted    with the chip  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then  fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:        E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and      E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    Three questions: 1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output:   E[M;K] = 64 bits   E[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits   E[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits    Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,    or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?       All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications    like cellular phones (or even regular phones over   2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?    Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,    or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only    transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into    everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?  3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself?    Does the block have to be present at all?    Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,    it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's     limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,    and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness    (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets    it recognize a valid E[K;U].)        In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT    wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?    (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.)    Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;    paranoid people can use someone else's serial number.     On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,    presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,    like use message encryption that's really E[M; K,U,N] ?

Something atypical of the net, but here it goes.         Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr. King.  From many of the newspaper, radio, and tv news reports I have seen, this adjective       is commonly in front of his name.  I have NEVER seen anyone complain about the use of this adjective when used in a benign manner.  I did not say that Mr. King was a no good black!  I do not know Mr. King and would not make this ascertian without some evidence to this effect.  I used it PURELY as a  descriptive adjective in the same manner than many ( most ) news people have used it in the past.         The entire second trial was about race, Ted.  I don't feel compelled to discuss Mr. King's racial background, but had Mr. King been white there would not have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating would not have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult call to make.  It is possible the case, but not definately.          I still think your actions are crap, Ted.  They are far more divisive than me using the adjective 'black' in a non-derogenory manner.  Would you have been happier if I had used 'African-american' ?  If so, then you really are lost in the world of PC.  You have already been instrumental in getting one persons net access revoked, and I wonder if you have sent a copy of my  message to my sys admin with a plea that I am not worthy of posting.\",\"   # I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: I simply don't agree # with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force.    # And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the # Holy Qur'an, the Bible, etc.  There have been times in the spiritual # and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical # descriptions of Heaven, Hell, and Satan were taken quite literally # and that *worked* for the time.  As I mentioned in the Tradition # cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory # about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the \\\"evil\\\" # which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as \\\"satanic.\\\"       Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is      metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not      the same way?  # The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane # in human language is something like describing \\\"color\\\" to a person # who has been blind from birth.  You may want to read the book # FLATLAND (if you haven't already) or THE DRAGON'S EGG.  The first # is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con- # cept...  [some deleted for space saving]  # When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe # another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then # such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be # necessary.  The \\\"unseen\\\" is described in terms which have reference` # and meaning for the reader/listener.  But, like all models, a compro- # mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness # of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all # crippled.  But what else can you do?       This is why I asked the above.  How would you then      know God exists as a spirit or being rather than      just being metaphorical?  I mean, it's okay to say      \\\"well, Satan is just metaphorical,\\\" but then you      have to justify this belief AND justify that God is      not some metaphor for something else.       I say this because there are many, many instances of      Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in       the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the      New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is      described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know      one is metaphorical and not the other.       Further, belief in God isn't a bar to evil.  Let's      consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were      metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe      in God to justify this belief.

Born 1959    Teacher    Sumgait Secondary School No. 10    Secretary of the Komsomol Organization at School No. 10    Member of the Sumgait City Komsomol Committee Office     Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15    Microdistrict No. 3    Sumgait [Azerbaijan]  [Note: The events in Kafan, used as a pretext to attack Armenians in   Azerbaijan are false, as verified by independent International Human Rights  organizations - DD]  I'm thinking about the price the Sumgait Armenians paid to be living in Armenia now. We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the price was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide our lives into \\\"before\\\" and ''after.\\\" We talk like that: that was before the war. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole epoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live, it will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even  sharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now . . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that happened.  Nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and  those who didn't.  That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you  could already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was near and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as my parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children.  My parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought that they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.  In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the afternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all our family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel like it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our  apartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in  his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely  locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a  hospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people  who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends of many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.  My parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my  mother, \\\"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\\\" But Mother was detached, pale, as  though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never  expected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A  girlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said,  \\\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out  of the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment.\\\"  We went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl  crawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that  perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside  me. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to embrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina  was thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to  say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout.  There was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from excited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time Karina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back, but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us  immediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at  least so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their  eyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst in, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They  came into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other  room. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma  snatched the axe from behind and said, \\\"Tell them not to touch the children.  Tell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\\\" She said this to Father in Armenian.  There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They  understood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian,  they don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \\\"You and  your children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your  children that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls,  our mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\\\" and  so on and so forth, \\\"and we came to do the same thing to you.\\\" This whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They  were mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people  among them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town,  all the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm  a teacher.  So they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took  him in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there, because he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all  but a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were  doing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off  Mamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \\\"I'm old enough to  be your mother! What are you doing?!\\\" He struck her. Now he's being held,  Mamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina,  who's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying  to lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their  consciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they  mustn't do it. She said, \\\"Come on, let's straighten this out, without  emotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we  ever do to you?\\\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come  into our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and  coming--said, \\\"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We  came here to kill them.\\\"  They pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she  didn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \\\"What did we do to you? What did we do to you?\\\" And even later, when she came to,  she said, \\\"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\\\"  That group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only  broke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they  were beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain  nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do  was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they did to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off,  they beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but  didn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they  could to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists,  kicking her, using anything they could find.  Mamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain,  just didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they  did. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the apartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the  corners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \\\"Let's take her  outside.\\\"  Those beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they  weren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time  I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't  afraid of what would happen to them.  When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered  with blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several  times from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though  I were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm  vengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold  a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time  I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them,  and I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me  \\\"forget,\\\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.  At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and  despite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had to do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering  to an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that he's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me and took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over me. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that they planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up with their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a  really deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I  suddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly  I felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I  just imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the  ground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was  still lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all, they became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with their feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe- cially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.  I came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it.  Some people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't  need any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had  even forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth  living.  There was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman  pain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come  because I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself,  and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to put an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The  person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well,  because he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he  has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person,  one who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see,  even during the investigation he almost called me \\\"daughter,\\\" he apologized,  although, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that  I can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my  words, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes, but then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never  forget it.  I wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one  could protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of  beasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything. I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.  And Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to  kill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an  end to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into  the other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it  was, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was  thrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her  and made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all  the deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor  from the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a  little. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku, how we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said,  \\\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes, I, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\\\" he says, \\\"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and  think I never shall again.\\\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw  everything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken  the father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He  saw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven people. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the  brothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that  they were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to  do something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I  After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and  Lyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even  remember my sister's name. I wanted to cry \\\"Marina!\\\" out to her, but could not. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus I saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both there by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell  right away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad  that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . .  although her spirit was murdered . . .  At some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that  mob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his  name, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \\\"Igor, help!\\\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were  taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and  Lyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the  neighbors.  And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment,  something like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.   Then they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one,  they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out  onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already  sure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone  said, \\\"She's already dead, let's throw her out.\\\" When they carried me out onto the balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I  heard someone say in Azerbaijani: \\\"Don't kill her, I know her, she's a  teacher.\\\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't remember whose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an  accent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks Azerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and  I having opened my  eyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had  been beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only  remember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately  I can't remember anything more.  What should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot  about him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too much. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that  women usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan, if he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated very sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in  Ufa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that  all out later.  Among the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary  of the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is  Najaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure, she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she  didn't want to endanger him. She said, \\\"He was there,\\\" and a little while  later, \\\"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else.  No, it seems like it was he.\\\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see  us the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something  entirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to see us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought  groceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started  crying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting  us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned  him to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait.  The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is  right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the  investigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone  to Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility.  Ill now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she  bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her  wedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's  lives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A  Russian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised by his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a  special school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm  a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that boy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine,  and analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too.  After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.  He beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \\\"Lady, if you give us all the gold  and money in your apartment we'll let you live.\\\" And Mamma told them where  the gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and  everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other  over and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one  another right then.  Mamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was black and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she  ran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil- low. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead,  halfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see,  and was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth,  it was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.  The bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father  out of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room, a small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people  were standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants,  everywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee service--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \\\"I was afraid  to turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the  threshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and  dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'.\\\" Mamma remembered one of the  criminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her,  out of one eye. She says, \\\"I realized that my death would come from that  person. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\\\" Later they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.  I was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina  was already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all alone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and Lyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out. I went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another.  But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones  I had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the  ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and  that all of that would die with me.  At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I  didn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that we were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \\\"Neighbor, is that you?\\\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived I would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been  taken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to  take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he  started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room.  The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in  the air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the  presence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities  or not. He said, \\\"Enough, let's go to the third entryway.\\\" In the third  entryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once  again that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as  they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they  found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had  already taken the other.  Four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They had to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over those 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I  identified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an  Azerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian: \\\"Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\\\" That's just what he said, \\\"those Azerbaijanis,\\\" as though he himself were not  Azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \\\"I'll drive them out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails and nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41.\\\"  That's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the  person in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened  to, the \\\"general,\\\" said that they were going to the third entryway.  Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself.  Marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer.  He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut.  But the door was lying on the floor in the hall.  I went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt  from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find  anything. He told me, \\\"Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the  neighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're  alive.\\\" He told me all this in Armenian.  Then he returned to the others and said, \\\"What are you waiting for? Leave!\\\"  They said, \\\"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her  yourself. No, we want to do it to.\\\" He urged them on, but gently, not  coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just boys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went down to the third floor with them himself, and said, \\\"Leave. What's the mat- ter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\\\" And he came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that  he couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I  told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really good terms with them.  We knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman  opened the door and immediately said, \\\"I'm an Azerbaijani.\\\" He said, \\\"I know.  Let her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows about this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\\\" She says, \\\"Fine, have her come in.\\\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I  had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into  tears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a  half-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \\\"Do you know where my family  is, what happened to them?\\\" She says, \\\"No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid  to go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see  who's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian.\\\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my  neighbor says, \\\"You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you,  or my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\\\" During the butchery in our apartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl earrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was  still there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I  touched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it to her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.  I went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I  don't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I  end up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the  apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor.  I had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had  hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near  some broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing.  Then they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I  think that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were broken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay  there without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town  could hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were  burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started picking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport  jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the one end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out.  And again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to  strangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on  my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me afterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got  burned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was protecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know  how. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if  I found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I  had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on  living without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I  thought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her.  I tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in  Afghanistan, he should protect her.  While I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I thought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would  she live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among  themselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter.  Another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good  job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was  all over. They started to argue. A third one says, \\\"How come you get it? I  have four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need.  All these years I've been living in God-awful places.\\\" Another one says,  \\\"Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave.\\\" Then someone said  that Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their place. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and left.  Oh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite  frequently, \\\"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let  them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\\\" Then they  said, \\\"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\\\" They repeated it  very often.         - - - reference for #008 - - -  [1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,     Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by     Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Hentrich        baba@Tymnet.Com -    I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling himself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first in the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal term but may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotations are quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the eightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar Max Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the Nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is synonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who originally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans and possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word by Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is nontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claim to call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor- shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.    If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``In search of the Indo-Europeans\\\" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica. The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and for Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible things done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have no clear claim.\",\"   Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else, one can get too much of a good thing.   Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries, essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her, necessarily.    Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected.     These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.    People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that \\\"pisses off\\\" their body. Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard, causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it.    See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly.  and brain damage.   The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin, and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.   poisoning.   Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating , say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home, plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of things.  But it might be the MSG.    If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.   Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.\",\" As one of the \\\"Clintonites\\\" cited above, I'll try to clarify since this is not a case of Clinton's \\\"dishonesty.\\\" (I won't necessarily defend him on other issues.)    There were NEVER any specific projects included in the Community Development Block Grant portion of the President's proposal.  Congressional Republicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what they felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL  projects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus package was ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the White House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted to Congress.  It didn't work.)  The $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close to covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it were passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and at what level.  In the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one ever expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the  Republicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS PACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total  amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus  package for ALL projects.    The plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are places where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing priorities.  If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects that will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton administration has been publicizing the issue.  A final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is worth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to them is new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally  supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending, arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending priorities than \\\"Washington bureaucrats.\\\"    Is it clear now?

The real fear comes from them doing more than this.  This is a voluntary program, and thus harder for us to object to on the surface.  Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one.  They are pushing to get a standard in place, a secret standard, and if they get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market. It will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't have registered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan for most phone companies.  You see, with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to any cellular company, or other phones or ports because they will follow the standard.  AT&T has already announced a clipper chip encryption product.  The government has marketed hard to get major vendors to use these chips.   If they get enough market share, they will rule.  And thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be tapped by the police.  The public isn't that concerned about it now, after all.  They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listen to today!  They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure them only from the police.  Well, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work with other proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phones expensive.  Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them cheap, only the Mob will buy them.

I can't imagine how to estimate bat speed, but its pretty obvious that Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit, likely due to his back.    I don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the A's, and had no problems with it then. It might be that pre-back problems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're cold, its a hitch.    The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable with for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses track of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was  clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because he's changed his stance so much.  I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting all the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw himself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco's famous batting practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged bad hitting habits.   \",\"Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for Windows 3.1.  I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia's MS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some sites in the U.S.  The three I found were:  1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)                                 This was the smallest and simplest    of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.    It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra    button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the    title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press    a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would    have been nice if there was an \\\"ALWAYS ON TOP\\\" setting for the little    window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified    strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be    a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace    manager makes it an attractive package.  2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)                                While this workspace manager offered a    few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming    to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace    is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take \\\"snapshots\\\"    of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what     applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,    but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.    With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in    a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this    viewing functionality which is quite useful.  3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)                             This is an interesting package, which contains    a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies    include \\\"Backmenu\\\", which provides a pop-up root menu when you    press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu    is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,    which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could    say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also    bundled in \\\"backdesk.zip\\\" is a program called \\\"WRUN\\\", which allows    you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS    instead of using the File Manager to run applications.      The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite    differently to the other two workspace managers in that it    doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.    In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,    and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to    focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different    viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which    each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window    allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically    the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area    while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up    of a particular section.\",\" I am no expert on this.

Yep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the #1 spot.  It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.    Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean. --  Dale J.

I don't know what a \\\"low grade\\\" fusion reactor is, but the major problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some fractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith would have to be processed.  This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn't content with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust, average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound. This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.  On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; \\\"high-Ti\\\" basalts (Apollo 11 and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but... terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in titanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and sometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are *enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the world (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If even 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2 at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being mined today).\",\"// Hope I am in the right group!

[]  Define \\\"armed better\\\". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to 3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).  A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.  - A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull   the trigger again. - A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,   but will fire merely by pulling the trigger. - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again   to rotate to the next round. - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an   easy motion, even one handed. - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.  - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell   first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often   lost as you realize \\\"hey, it's jammed!\\\" before starting to do anything   about clearing it. - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round   and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the    chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider   this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed   of employment as a revolver. - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of   operation of many of them requires more training.  Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having accidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks require rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a VCR.  Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay attention. I do not seek here to say \\\"semi-autos are junk\\\" merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot.  Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a  wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything. Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit. I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit what I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously wrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than 5.  What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple .38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police  prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....  ObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they          introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking         as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal. \",\"day    Brent shows his ignorance once again.

In case of the Earth z is about 23.5 degrees, I think. I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus, z is almost 90 degrees.  u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured. Paris is at about 45 degrees.  North pole is at 90.  a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from 0 to 360 degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun. The spring equinox occurs at a=0.  L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day). On the equator (u=0) L is always 1/2.  Near the north pole (u=90 degrees) L is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.  Computation: Define the auxiliary angles p and q by: sin p = sin a sin z cos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       (0 < q < 180 degrees)  Conclusion: L = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees) L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)  Wait!

The graph will shows how the length of the daylight varies with the time of the year. Experiment with various choices of latitudes and tilt angles.

Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats) will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed.  Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from key escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.  Because life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal very large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assume that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous property (a cipher cellular phone).  Just as we have seen in the past with \\\"blue box\\\" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones, we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakes criminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen instruments.  Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days, a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.  There will be a continuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.  In other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, and persistent threat to the general public.  On the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a device in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at least stand out as being unusual, and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation.  Finally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments, there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications in the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered, and the instruments involved have been identified).  While recording and archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks, it is probably feasible across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks.  The existence of these recordings could open up vast potential for abuse.\",\"=I think that's the correct spelling.. = I am looking for any information/supplies that will allow =do-it-yourselfers to take Krillean Pictures.

That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry. Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one (though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of training.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.   Excellent point.  Perhaps you aren't so naive after all?   Taken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's make it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been taken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.   In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.

Any requirements other than just registering the shotgun?   \\\"Come on down to honest Erik's Used Swords!

The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good. In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere.

PDT                  Q   I had two questions for both Presidents, so you  could probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)              THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll  give you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)              Q   The first is that this is the meeting of the  Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government  money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the  government.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going  to be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian  businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What  are the priorities, because there are several association of  Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to  participate in setting up priorities for investment?                This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know  that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans  are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls  say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times  published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war;  42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent  if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to  sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not  very enthusiastic?  Thank you.              Q   I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going  to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the  answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.              THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is,  it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example,  the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will  obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be  good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will  be used to support the privatization of existing public  enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the  Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have  some influence over the distribution of.                With regard to your second question, let me say that  I would think that there would be people in both countries who  would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government  giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to  that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history  there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That  is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole  history of America, any kind of aid program has always been  unpopular.                What I have tried to tell the American people is, is  this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that  this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion -- trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments  because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in  Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them  working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies  going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it  possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the  economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and  investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce  nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on  our side and on the Russian side.                So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an  investment for the United States.  This is very much in the  interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the  second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next  week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for  the taxpayers and workers of my country.                Russia is a very great nation that needs some  partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share  her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view  this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not  what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful  investment.                Like all investments, there is some risk.  But  there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than  the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier  of the Cold War.              Q   Mr. President, first of all thank you very  much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory  of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American  President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind  of a very measured breakthrough.                I have two questions.  One, in your introductory  remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief  that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you  tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to  what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification  of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how  confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager  to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions  inherited from the Cold War?                PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of  Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with  regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent  states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States  develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing  that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of  the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude  our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that  would provide not only an important economic opportunity for  Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out  on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed  off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and  we agreed to continue to press that.              I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to  reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the  Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the  United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine,  but that, in order to do what we need to do together to  strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States  be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join  the NPT regime is critical.              What was the second question?                THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and  COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the  Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will,  as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other  restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on  relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies  of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of  them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the  leadership of the Congress.              With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be  an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there  are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to  emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there  is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed  to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be  much less.              With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing  more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my  own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement  out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to  begin it in the fairly near future.              Q   Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in  Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely  different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not  political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of  Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the  difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the  difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of  Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the  last part of your speech?              THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to  compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say  what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a  boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the  music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been  thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music  for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists  and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know  as much as I could about your history.                And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then  the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last  presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone  in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr.  Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I  was following events there very closely and hoping for the day  when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a  personal feeling about Russia.                I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like  music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a  musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York  Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony  to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly  than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically  so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it  occurred.                These are things that have always had a big impact  on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever  had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two  countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)              THE PRESS:  Thank you.\",\" The problem with \\\"Let's assume\\\" reasoning is that, taken to the extreme (and you're close), you arrive at \\\"Let's assume this is perfectly OK.\\\"  The assumptions you make are big ones. If the system is really secure, then why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?  There are plenty of encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure, so why in the world use one that does?  There are reasons, of course, but I certainly can't think of any honest ones.  Next, you assume we can \\\"trust\\\" the escrow houses. But the last time I checked, EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure, corruption, and even fabrication, of supposedly secure data. The govt is saying \\\"Yeah, but NOW we're serious, so you can trust us.\\\"  Bullcrypt.   And finally, although you didn't state it explicitly, you implicitly assume that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. The case in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this score.  Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers, right?  As others have pointed out, the current proposal will, if deployed, render truly secure encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sam's brand. Who will be able to afford, and be sufficiently motivated, to purchase this expensive, inconvenient higher protection?  Somebody with lots of extra cash...  The following is more true than ever:    \\\"When [strong] encryption is outlawed, only outlaws will have [strong] encryption.\\\" \",\"Hi!

The long answer is yes - but a few have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unix's are the same, you know! As far as \\\"many bugs\\\" go, it would probably be more useful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-)  Platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: RS6000, Dec Ultrix Sun Solaris so it is possible.  The main problem is that I don't have access to other platforms than the RS6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way I hear about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to how to fix it.  As far as the software not doing anything, do you really think I would bother releasing it, if that was the case? Perhaps you didn't read the few docs that ARE supplied. The dogfight world is made up of clients only, so if you're in there on your own, then you're not going to see anything! The dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary - so if you don't see anything there, then this is definitely a problem!  One final word - if you're not interested, don't bother with it. If you are interested, then please remember that I'm not asking for any money! So why not try a little patience and constructive criticism, maybe that will get results??\",\" Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that...I sounds to me, your UPS takes in AC, rectifies it to DC to charge the batteries, and then takes the battery DC and chops it to AC again, feeding your equipment.  This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since, as you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.  Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you lose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to replace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time and you've got to resync the AC in no time flat.  Unfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption that AC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to be usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.

Check out a medical supply catalog, the thing you are looking for is called a woods lamp (so you can check for woods sign, certain skin conditions flourecse (sp) under UV light)  They come in disposable penlight like types and larger ac powered types.  It is also used in eye examinations, a flourescent dye is introduced to the surface of the eye, then UV is shined on it, shows up scratches and abrasions very clearly that would otherwise be very difficult to detect.  (for the completest the dye is called flouescien, and in normal light appears orangish, and leaves a mild burning sensation to the eye for 10-15 minutes, until the tears flush it all out.    Have fun.\",\" oh yes, i'm quite sure they will :)\",\" Having thought about this, why don't you project the 2 lines onto the 2d plane formed by the lines.  Do an intersection calculation in the plane in 2D, where you're guaranteed a unique solution (unless they're parallel which won't happen in this case), and then use parametric distance along the lines from the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest.  This bypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in 3d.  Hope I haven't put my foot in it again!  steve ---\",\"  You'll probably get one when you realize that your $100 vesa super dooper local bus ultra high tech controller sucks...  With any luck PC bus archeitecture will be doen any with by sbus.  Have you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to a vesa local bus.  It actually  slows down your system  Maybe my workstation doesn't understand what your vesa local bus IDE is  Vesa local bus will be killed off by pcmi? whatever intels spec is. VLBUS it not good for much more than vga cards.  To each his own.  I'll laugh when you start crying over how much you spent for your 2 little ide drives and then finding out you need more space.  Here Here....    don't stick your foot in your mouth when you make a statement you know nothing about.   I'd rather wait a second compared to the 5 minutes and ide would take. (obviously exaggerated).  Have you ever tried to backup 2 gigs of disk?  Oh I forgot you can't because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.   I guess you probably bought a 486sx too   What?  The SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE spec has much more bandwidth than any stupid vlbus ide crap....  Stop this thread now, Its just cluttering up bandwidth.  If you want to read about scsi vs ide just pay a visit to you local usenet archive.  the best SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE,etc is clearly faster than any the best ide drive. All the response given are based upon personal experience with 1 or 2 drives.  You can't judge such completely different interfaces.   IDE has the low cost adavantage + a descent performance. SCSI has the ability for super high capacity expandibility and speed.  neither one is better in all cases.  If you don't belive what I said about busmastering and vlbus then pick up a back issue of PC-week in whihc they tested vlbus, eisa and isa busmastering cards.  send flames to /dev/null..... \",\" W4WG requires DOS drives.

My 1975 Saab 99 didn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In addition to the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another set integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who don't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic growth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out of the front fender, which incorporated amber \\\"parking lights\\\", amber side marker lights/reflectors, white \\\"cornering lamps\\\" (like American luxury cars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators on, and white \\\"backup lights\\\" aimed towards the back of the car when you have selected reverse gear.  The glossy brochure showed how these front mounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards (pot holes, kid's toys, etc) that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the wheels turned while backing up.\",\"  Interesting discussion.

Good.   I would hope so.  Let's define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon whose majority of energy comes from fission and/or fusion of atomic nuclei.

Nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined.  Other poisonous gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there is no use not related to weaponry.

Why? : Viola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does : Toronto have?  Well, I agree that Viola is a better signing.  However, why does everyone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthanded spot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters than lefthanded batters.  I just don't understand why people insist on lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium). Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters. I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams may be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probably only a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters for this reason during the regular season.  I think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of whether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to have higher ERA's than righthanded starters, precisely because managers go out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of the platoon advantage).

I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is essentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civil liberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get involved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good reason.  When I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a security point of view, but wouldn't tell us how to fix it.  I always figured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix the problem.  Then I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason. Auditors don't like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The auditee can say, \\\"Well, you told us this way would be OK.\\\"  It compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's job.  Taking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar. Suppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU's part, a key half gets away that shouldn't, and is used to deprive someone of her civil liberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court. But they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant and of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.  There are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one place where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum was kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and was brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.  I believe the difference between this situation and the key registration situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll checks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again today, he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can be destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are legit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could put the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU conflict of interest.  As always, my opinions are my own.\",\"tes:   A friend of mine who smoke pot every day and last Tuesday took 5 hits of acid  is still having trouble \\\"aiming\\\" for the bowl when he takes a dump.

Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco \\\"America on the Road\\\" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called \\\"The Devil Wagon in God's Country\\\" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or John Bell Rae's auto histories.  As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I don't know why.   Dan dh3q@andrew.cmu.edu Carnegie Mellon University Applied History\",\"  Exactly. Some of the SPACE:1999 effects remain first-rate even today.     Later on, the Andersons tried to shed their reputation as creators of some of the worst pseudo-scientific shows in TV history by flying \\\"Into Infinity.\\\" This was a one-off thing done as part of BBC's \\\"educational SF\\\" series \\\"The Day After Tomorrow.\\\" The Anderson episode dealt with a spaceship capable of reaching the speed of light (\\\"lightship Altares\\\"), the four-man crew eventually  journeyed into a black hole and ended up on the far side of the galaxy (I think). I saw this as a 9-year-old back in 1976 and liked it very much, but then again I was a fan of SPACE:1999 so I guess I was easily satisfied in those days:-) --- Does anyone know if \\\"Into Infinity\\\" has been released on video?

First, my above statement doesnot say that \\\"the existence of israeli citizens    in the WB revoke their right of life\\\" but it says \\\"the israeli occupation    of the WB revoke the right of life for some/most its citizens - basically    revokes the right of for its military men\\\". Clearly, occupation is an    undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate.   Ok, let me re-phrase the question. I have repeatedly asked you if the  Israelis have less human rights than the palestinians, and if so, why. From your posting (where you did not directly adress my question) I inferred that you thought so. Together with the above statement I then assumed that the reason was the actions of the state of Israel. Re: your statement of  occupation: I'd like you to define the term, so I don't have to repeat this 'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary.     Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to    protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing    Palestinean human rights.  I'm sorry, but the above sentence does not make sense. Please rephrase it.      |> If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then     |> tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?      Because not all states are like Israel, as oppressive, as ignorant, or as tyrant.  Oh, ok. So how about the human rights of the Syrians, Iraqis and others? Does the name of Hama sound familiar? Or how about the kurds in Iraq and Turkey?  How about the Same in Sweden (Ok, maybe a bit farfetched..) the Russians in the Baltic states or the Moslem in the old USSR and Yugoslavia?

So you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights.    (i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph).  No, I'm agreeing that to just kick all the Palestinians out of Israel proper  would probably lead to disaster for both parties.

Since you claim to be logical I felt it best to point this out before you started using your statements to prove a point or so. Am I then to assume you are  not logical?    Any quote can be misused, especially when used to stereotype all  individuals by a statement of an individual. If you use the same methods that you credit 'Zionists' with, then where does that place you?  Oh, by the way, I'd advice you not to assume anything about my 'loyalties'. I will and am condemning acts I find vile and inhuman, but I'll try as  long as I can not to assume those acts are by a whole people. By zionist above do you mean the state of Israel, the government of Israel,  the leaders of Israel (political and/or religious) or the jews in general? If you feel the need to condemn, condemn those responsible instead. How would you feel if we started condemning you personally based on the bombings in Egypt?   -- \",\"Does anyone know what is available in terms of automated testing of X/Motif applications.

Is it distressing Brendan?  The point is that any eugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacks of pure Nazism.  The fact that Elias' proposal cast the entire \\\"problem\\\" as one of the abnormal presence of Israeli society in the Middle East, and that he buried a slam against U.S. aid to Israel in the midst of his \\\"even-handed\\\" solution of the Jewish Question, made it obvious what  he had in mind: disolving the Jewish polity.  That *is* a Nazi doctrine: rectification of the \\\"abnormal presence\\\" of the Jewish people within a  larger body politic.  Whether your \\\"solution\\\" involves gas, monetary  incentives to the poor Jews to marry out, or as Feisal Husseini has  said, \\\"disolve the Zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal  surrounding Arab culture,\\\" you are engaged in a Nazi project.  Just as obvious is your statement: \\\"I will not comment on the value or lack of value of Elias's proposal.\\\"  Still striking the glancing blow, right Brendan?

I see...  :-)   You can believe that if you wish.  It is undeniable, however, that people  have left the compound unharmed and alive earier in the standoff.  And since their leader was preaching that they would have an apocalypse, you  can not say undeniably that there wouldn't have been a mass suicide if the  FBI had simply stayed outside and waited another 51 days.   I am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense. You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this  compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless  to me.  I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't  stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me  sad and sick.   Have you ever heard of Jonestown? The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority  worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these  people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot  more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as  last year.

I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph, nor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:  a) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several 1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip I made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800 miles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I   would have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles. No problems with winds and curves.   Then there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where we were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.  b) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see no difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip back from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind you, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better than the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still get 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.    Now now, you can't compare a diesel with a gasoline engine. I see enough bmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have 100-150k miles on them and advertise  rebuilt engines. If honda was to build an accord for 30k, I'd darn well expect the sucker to last 300k miles.   Ever got caught behind a early 80's 300SDL at a stop light? It's not pleasant. The newer MB's are a lot better though. The diesel Volvos and VWs are probably the smelliest offenders.  As for economy, why should we care? Gas is cheap!

Then he goes on the make statements which make me shudder.  He has established a two-tiered God.  One set of rules for the Jews (his people) and another set for the saved Gentiles (his people).  Why would God discriminate?  Does the Jew who accepts Jesus now have to live under the Gentile rules.  God has one set of rules for all his people.  Paul was never against the law.  In fact he says repeatedly that faith establishes rather that annuls the law.  Paul's point is germane to both Jews and Greeks.  The Law can never be used as an instrument of salvation.  And please do not combine the ceremonial and moral laws in one.  In Matt 5:14-19 Christ plainly says what He came to do and you say He was only saying that for the Jews's benefit.

Yes, the argument can (and has) been made that current government policy creates even larger market barriers than there were in the first place, but there is no such term as 'government failure', since the government can change policies whenever it pleases.  The market doesn't do that and is governed by (relatively) well-understood forces.  This libertopican bilge about 'moral arguments' about taxation, etc., is, at bottom, so much simplistic economic thinking. It can only be 'justified' by cliche derision of anyone who knows more about economics than the libertopian -- which is what invariably happens.  Tripe a la Tommy, the new libertopian dish.    Wherever do you get this inflated idea of your own importance?  --  \\\"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live  in the real world.\\\"   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden\",\"  That was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?      --------------------------------------------------     \\\"I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns   to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.\\\"      --------------------------------------------------        I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're   paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own   eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps   people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,   \\\"bullshit filters\\\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.    Later in the same post:      Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building   were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and   am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.  Fine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are \\\"inclined\\\" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those claims are still ludicrous, however.  Previously Awesley had written:   You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.  Prompting me to write:   To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion   grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be   perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since   it makes your other claim seem more plausible.  To which Awesley replied:   John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you   have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said   nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you   need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a   while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.  But why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the notion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion because it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But that too is ludicrous.    If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been   screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about   it.   Awesley relied:      Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an   authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it   had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an   authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged   massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.   Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but   the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \\\"several\\\".  I've also   heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd   assert that I claimed they were truth.  Yes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have.  Army tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's without it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on it and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying \\\"this has gone far enough.\\\"  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis for my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it.  Not one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and everybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it had happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own research failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is extraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not.  Unless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I do not.    Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.        Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the    difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26    years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.   So it would have been an Army cover-up.  Quibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has taught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half decades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said \\\"yes, I shelled Americans,\\\" or \\\"I gave the orders to fire the cannons,\\\" or \\\"I helped cover it up\\\"?    If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer   to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that   those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.  Awesley replied:     Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe   that they did fire their guns.  Good.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did.  Your belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known?  Awesley concludes:      Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read   this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the   account I cited.  Actually, now we have established that I don't believe what you believe, as well as why I don't believe it.  And if it's boring, then I yield the last word to you, if you want it.  You may say anything you like with impunity--I am dropping the subject.\",\"A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView. Since he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post it for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:  CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most annoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to do with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its \\\"current directory\\\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell) when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView doesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems  to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \\\"dithering\\\", again writing another file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this second file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does the last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to your screen again.  (It does this last \\\"recopy\\\" operation for its \\\"fit to screen\\\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)   The result of this process is the following:         1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all         you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of         data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never         realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.       2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for         the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the         dithering and writes to the screen card.         However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data         from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)         one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which         there was room on the disk.  This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general idea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details about file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient disk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be very large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess of 6 Meg free disk space.   CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from a floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the floppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT table? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly unrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files menu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing? \",\"HI All, Can someone point me towards some articles on 'boids' or flocking algorithms... ?

You could prove almost anything by taking little quotes out of context from the Bible - it's a big book, you know. I doubt you could find a single case of a anti-ecological action taking place specifically because teh perpetrator was motivated by a Christian belief.  As for the Nazis, they were motivated by German Nationalism, not by Christianity. In fact they despised Christianity as a weak pacifist religion, and were much more keen on pagan glorification of strength and warfare. They killed the Jews because they were not Germans, not because they were \\\"Christ-killers\\\" - they were just as keen on killing the other non-German ethnic minority, the Romanies or Gypsies.\",\"  Just a thought on resources,  It is very important if you do use a multiplatform toolkit to check on how it uses resources.  I have used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resource converter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially the naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets. With windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance, this doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK, and Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So  your constructor should know how to convert a #define into the proper resource identifier. I'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does use resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to port to. ( By the way, I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel for anything )     Alex.  \",\"...

I  felt for the money my NEC 5FG that I use at work was a much better monitor. The NEC is sharper, flatter, less distorted, and more stable.  I have heard  complaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control  problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.  There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not  match up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the  frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that  the NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter  and the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable  pincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness  when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the  controls.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the  raster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome  as the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.  I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold  through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that  way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has  my vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if  it's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to  buy.  I have no experience with the Nanao.  I can never keep the Nanao models  straight and don't have any place I can walk in to get a good comparison of  all models.  --   Standard employer disclaimers apply   \",\":  : I am a Mormon.

I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court. Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record calls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants and listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this strategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not in the near term.)  In other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence inadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to interpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprised that archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything but analogous to a wiretap by the courts.  Note that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technically feasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without warrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future, start surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause, decrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation gets a boost from data that, sadly, won't ever be presented to a jury.

Then we'll make it a crime ever to be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy cubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and after.  But, see, there's still a right to privacy.  We haven't curtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it'd be to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a VR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.  And hey, nobody'll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.  After all, if you're not doing anything illegal...  Funny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became pretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn't elminate all crime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds of national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their execs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of competition.  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system.   I can't imagine why. \",\"  Good question.  I'm sure some biologist could answer better than I, but animals brains are just set up differently.  Animals *can* be trained, but if they're instincts serve them well, there is no reason to contradict them.\",\"}>}>}(a) out of context; }>}>Must have missed when you said this about these other \\\"promises of god\\\" that we keep }>}>getting subjected to.

In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health insurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like socialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary insurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward. With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.  That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund is to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back in Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \\\"libertarian\\\" faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these).  I'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about leftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian newsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100% insurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know it, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American conservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who seriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about the Americans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans who spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that shouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for insurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that the Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite being open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to spend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a different culture.   \\\"Managed Care\\\" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most western nations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France and Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says of HMO/NHS approaches, \\\"We left that behind with East Germany!\\\"). Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling doctors with budget strings.  In Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France and Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public hospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisions are different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked \\\"sickness funds\\\" over a century old while Canada divides by their provinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the doctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)  With such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to the U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The French and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations in more compact geography to improve scales of economy.  gld\",\"I have the following Genesis/Megadrive games for sale or trade for other Genesis/MD (or SNES games).

This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED    with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K    colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB    VRAM.  2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:     a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an       Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often       remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to       be.     b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the       display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you       shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).  3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development    Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger    icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the    debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed    to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The    Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.     Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen    is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter    \\\"R\\\". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it    does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this.     The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive    behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with    Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles    the VGA mode.

About 20 years ago, _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips  in them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called \\\"Son o' God\\\" comics.  It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic, there were a  group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn, and when one of them said  the magic word, he turned into \\\"Son o' God.\\\" He went from a myopic,  curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied  portraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile  features.    Now, if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus,  and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this  NatLamp Jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since  this Jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.   This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim  that they are Christian. They profess faith in Jesus, but the Jesus  that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the  NatLamp Jesus was. \",\"Hi everyone. I recently posted about how I received a bad vram chip for my new LCIII, and someone responded that it may not actually be bad, but it may be a 512K LC vram chip, and thus doesn't work properly with my computer. So I'm wondering if anyone can interpret these codes for me, so I can figure out what type of chip MacConnection sent me.     2515251  On the back of the card, it says 0593  I believe from the numbers that means it is an 80ns chip, but I can't figure out what the size is supposed to be.

HOWEVER, all this macho shit aside, the fact is that when you are riding a bike and a dog is arrowing to intercept, it may be unwise for you to stop and try to deal with the dog, for the simple fact that it might be through your leathers and working on your jeans before you can dismount and deal with it properly.  By all means, if you do kick the dog or otherwise get its attention, STOP and STAY there. If you kick the dog and ride away, that is a victory for the dog -- it drove you out of its territory. It is not even a qualified victory, it is a victory. If you kick it and STOP, and sit there, 99% of dogs will say, \\\"Oh, shit! This guy's serious!\\\" and back off. Now you have established your dominance over the dog, and it probably will not bother you again.  Llamas, however, are a different story.

Consider two vertices, p and q, which are connected by at least one edge.  If (p,q) is an edge, then (q,p) should *not* appear.

If a *marked* edge is discovered to be inconsistent, then you lose.  If step 1) finds more than one face sharing a particular edge, then you lose.       Otherwise, when done, all of the edges will be consistent.  Which means that all of the surface normals will either point IN or OUT.

It is an S3 86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my second meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from them, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say \\\"Buy the memory from us\\\" or something like that.)   The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a 1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256. Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I asked them why, and all I got was \\\"Your point is well taken, but Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects.\\\"   So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805 drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're broken.   If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805 cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are \\\"less busy\\\".

I say this because there are only two possible paths of \\\"gun control\\\" which you could have been referencing.  Either: 1) You were talking about their access to semi-automatics firearms.  In this case I should point out that semi-automatic firearms are legal in most areas of this Country, including Texas and Colorado.  In addition the members of the \\\"cult\\\" have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the ability to purchase these weapons.  So under what grounds would you deny them these guns?  Their religion?  The fact they they live in a large group alone by themselves?  Because you consider them to be a cult?  Maybe I consider your Church to be a cult!  This line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of \\\"thought crimes.\\\"  You and Pat Robertson should really get along.  2) You were referring to the ALLEGED FULLY automatic weapons possessed by the \\\"cult.\\\"  Under current US law, FULLY automatic weapons have been covered by some of the strictest gun control laws in this Nation.  So if David Koresh illegally possessed them, he would have had to circumvent some of the strictest laws we have.  How will more laws help?  By the way, it has been reported that David Koresh possessed a Federal Firearms License which would have permitted  him to possess FULLY automatic weapons.  If true, the 85 people who perished Monday in the fire, died so that the Federal government could collect a couple hundred dollars in taxes on guns David Koresh didn't declare.  I have heard claims that they were \\\"stockpiling weapons.\\\"  Yet considering the number of people in the complex, even 200+ weapons would not have been out of line with gun ownership statistics for all of Texas.

In this case I should point out that semi-automatic firearms are legal in most areas of this Country, including Texas and Colorado.  In addition the members of the \\\"cult\\\" have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the ability to purchase these weapons.  So under what grounds would you deny them these guns?  Their religion?  The fact they they live in a large group alone by themselves?  Because you consider them to be a cult?  Maybe I consider your Church to be a cult!  This line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of \\\"thought crimes.\\\"  You and Pat Robertson should really get along.  2) You were referring to the ALLEGED FULLY automatic weapons possessed by the \\\"cult.\\\"  Under current US law, FULLY automatic weapons have been covered by some of the strictest gun control laws in this Nation.  So if David Koresh illegally possessed them, he would have had to circumvent some of the strictest laws we have.  How will more laws help?  By the way, it has been reported that David Koresh possessed a Federal Firearms License which would have permitted  him to possess FULLY automatic weapons.  If true, the 85 people who perished Monday in the fire, died so that the Federal government could collect a couple hundred dollars in taxes on guns David Koresh didn't declare.  I have heard claims that they were \\\"stockpiling weapons.\\\"  Yet considering the number of people in the complex, even 200+ weapons would not have been out of line with gun ownership statistics for all of Texas.  What's next?  A siege of Dallas/Ft Worth for alleged \\\"stockpiling?\\\"  Face it David Skaggs, You have voted for virtually EVERY gun control law that has passed through Congress, yet you claim that you are only for \\\"reasonable\\\" restrictions.

(RATHER NOT!) The CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather. (RATHER BIASED!)\",\"  \\\"Assuming\\\"? Also: come on, Brad. If we are going to get anywhere in  this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never  addressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is  \\\"right\\\" or who is \\\"wrong\\\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover  and that, having been placed \\\"in between\\\" the Israelis and the guerillas, they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.    [The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms   is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that   civilians will not be thought of by the other side as  \\\"combatants\\\". So, what do you think is the \\\"meaning behind\\\",   the intention and the effect when an \\\"army\\\" purposely   *does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look   like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will   receive from this \\\"cover\\\" is more important that the harm  that will come to civilians.*  This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians in \\\"the middle\\\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians.   But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves  at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \\\"why set   ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made   cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of   view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept   some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.   I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND ineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait  until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that \\\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\\\" will do more to stop attacks.   As I said previously, Israel spent several decades \\\"sitting passively\\\" on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after* the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well. The \\\"host\\\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks  from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact  on the civilians caught in their path.    This is just another \\\"selectively applied\\\" statement.   The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.  That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for  the \\\"interim\\\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are demanding conditions that essentially define \\\"autonomy\\\" already. They DO NOT trust that Israel will \\\"follow through\\\" the entire process and allow Palestinians to reach full autonomy.   Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians?  If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians  be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words? Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up \\\"tangible assets  (land, control of areas) in exchange for \\\"words\\\". For this reason, they are also concerned about the sorts of \\\"guarantees\\\" they will have  that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.  Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the Israelis \\\"word\\\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being demanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party finally gets HOLD of this \\\"land\\\", what the \\\"other party\\\" does is totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land, your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to keeps its word does NOT get the land back.   While the \\\"major armaments\\\" (those allowing people to wage \\\"civil wars\\\") have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still remain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \\\"commando\\\" raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.   Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks were commonplace.   There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \\\"disarmed\\\" UNLESS the state is as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.  That's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to \\\"take over\\\" Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that. What both \\\"sides\\\" need is to receive something \\\"tangible\\\". The Arabs/ Palestinians are looking for \\\"land\\\" and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it gives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks\",\" I'm not sure about Juha, but another top center, Rauli Raitanen([ss{t) is drafted by Jets.

Richmond or Syracuse?  He was taken by the Jays in the Rule V draft, but not kept on the roster.  Baseball Weekly said that he was demoted to Syracuse, but a Toronto paper indicated that the Braves took him back.  Is there an Atlanta fan, or anyone reading this, who knows?   \",\" The \\\"so sacred it's secret\\\" explanation is a bit misleading.  While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.   There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).  Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \\\"You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you\\\" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.   But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few:  1. \\\"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given\\\" (Matt. 13:11).  2. \\\"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\\\" (Matt. 19:11).  3. \\\"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\\\" (John 16:12).  4. \\\"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father\\\" (John 16:25).  5. \\\"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\\\" (1 Cor. 3:1-2).  6. \\\"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face\\\" (2 Jn. 1:12).  (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.   Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------          Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City                     jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu\",\" Someone else said something similar.  I will not comment on the value or lack of value of Elias's \\\"proposal\\\".  I just want to say that it is very distressing that at least two people here are profoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine.  They were NOT like Elias's idea, they were more like the opposite.    Nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  An  instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to  Nazi theoreticians, Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted, and in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies were considered not pure Gypsies but \\\"mongrels\\\" formed from the pure Gypsy  race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between  the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies, by the way.  It is also  true that towards the end of WWII even the \\\"purist\\\" Gypsies were  hunted down as the theory was forgotten.\",\"  Since running any GUI over a network is going to slow it down by a fair amount, I expect Windows NT will be multiuser only in the sense of sharing filesystems. Someone will likely write a telnetd for it so one could run character-based apps, but graphics-based apps will have to be shared by running the executables on the local CPU. This is how things are shaping up everywhere: client-server architectures are taking over from the old cpu-terminal setups.

Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xt happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered,  the specification does not guarantee such a sequence, and supplemental  authoritative documents (i.e. the Asente/Swick volume) do say that the order is undefined.  Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.  In general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating  independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other callbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be  registered can explicitly call other functions necessary.  [4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?   XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not  actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?    It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback, which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer is set to one of the valid values. If it is not a \\\"yes\\\" answer, the code drops out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop:    void quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)  {   int             answer;   answer = AskUser(w, \\\"Really Quit?\\\");   if (RET_YES == answer)    {    answer = AskUser(w, \\\"Are You Really Positive?\\\");    if (RET_YES == answer)     exit(0);                 }  }   A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether  to overwrite it.  This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the calling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the  Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of  dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for \\\"OK\\\", \\\"Cancel\\\" and  \\\"Help\\\" or equivalents:    int AskUser(w, string)         Widget          w;         char           *string;   {         int             answer=RET_NONE; /* some not-used marker */         Widget          dialog;   /* could cache&carry, but ...*/         Arg             args[3];         int             n = 0;         XtAppContext    context;          n=0;         XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,                 XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;         XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;         dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);         XtManageChild(dialog);          context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);         while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {                 XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);         }         XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */         return answer;   }   The dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same  function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user  finally selects one of those choices:    void response(w, client, call)         Widget          w;         XtPointer client;         XtPointer call;   {   int *answer = (int *) client;   XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;         switch (reason->reason) {         case XmCR_OK:                 *answer = RET_YES; /* some #define value */                 break;         case XmCR_CANCEL:                 *answer = RET_NO;    break;         case XmCR_HELP:                 *answer = RET_HELP;                 break;         default:                 return;         } }  and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and continues from there.

If you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do  what you want. Note that it depends on the widget's internal data structures  and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt, including R4.   #include <X11/CoreP.h>  #include <X11/Xresource.h>  String XtName (widget)  Widget widget; /* WILL work with non-widget objects */  {  return XrmNameToString(widget->core.xrm_name);  }  [7/90; modified with suggestion by Larry Rogers (larry@boris.webo.dg.com) 9/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 125)  Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindow(widget)? I'm doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics within my Xt-based program:    The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the  realization of the widget.  Using a window id of NULL (\\\"no window\\\") could  create the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget()  before attempting to use the window associated with a widget.   Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call,  but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also  wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?  The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of  the screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can take the following steps to avoid the error:  1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture. 2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle. 3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap. 4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the image from the pixmap. 5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and  the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you  the parts of the pixmap which aren't good. 6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.

A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight character-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:    display = XOpenDisplay(display_name);  if (display)   { do X stuff }  else   { do curses or something else } where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following -display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case  XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].  This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line  argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is  adequate. [5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 128)  How do I make a \\\"busy cursor\\\" while my application is computing? Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?   The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is  as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel  window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other  application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the  user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual  desktop.) Substitute \\\"toplevel\\\" with your top-most widget here (similar code  should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):       unsigned long valuemask;      XSetWindowAttributes attributes;       /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */      valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;      attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |          ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);      attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);       /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by         its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */      XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,          65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,          CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);  where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen, particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767.  When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to normal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well.  In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor  resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events.

An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which  continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its  children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X  connection to the display.   What you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process,    close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget))); to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your  exec. You will then be able to exit the parent.  Alternatively, before exec'ing make this call, which causes the file  descriptor to be closed on exec.

Greg Holmberg (holmberg@frame.com), 3/93.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 130)  Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler?   No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical  sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which  might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave the library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by  Xlib or Xt functions.  You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added.   Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly  Volume 6 are in error.  [Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse  (converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 131)  What are these \\\"Xlib sequence lost\\\" errors?   You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error  handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or  Xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?   It's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input  both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but  which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or  the other file descriptor.  A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor, use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be  called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your  program's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt  callback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only non-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.  Most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an  input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.  Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file. You will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending. XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is  called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is new data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always  ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almost always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the  type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your  function to test whether there is new data:       if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return; But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a  busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting  a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.

You can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting the window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget which should receive the event.   If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use  XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you avoid a round-trip to the server.  Depending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call its action procedures in order to get the effects you want.  [courtesy Mark A. Horstman (mh2620@sarek.sbc.com), 11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 134)  Why doesn't anything appear when I run this simple program?    You are right to map the window before drawing into it. However, the  window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen -- until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will  generally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code  would appear after window was created and mapped:   while (!done)     {       XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);       switch (the_event.type) {  case Expose:  /* On expose events, redraw */   XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);   break;  ...  }     }   Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't  set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background  colors, so this program could previously include this code:   ...   the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */   the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */   the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,                 GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);   ...   Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is  black and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1  and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be  reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.  Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong  thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for  foreground and background.  And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program if you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may not yet have appeared.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?   The 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A  server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0, unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit -- the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available  Screens on this particular Display connection.  The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.  In Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine  the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.  (Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the Screen have \\\"Display\\\" in the names --  XDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

No.  Once set, the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be  re-read by clients.  The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap, set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The  window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're  sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea()  to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read  back that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and  it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD  and Stuart Marks of Sun]   Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a  (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the  original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved.

A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly window. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have several choices:  - the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to make non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers  support the extension.  - a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note  that there is no X notion of a \\\"transparent color index\\\".  - a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny  windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.  - a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly.

When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a background of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black and White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break.]  If you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be  allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre-computed values.  If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you  can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics  context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over  red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red.

Make sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red, green, and blue  fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is  full-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color)  the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is  usually black.

I have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the  standard colormap, but it doesn't work.    XGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does  not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists. Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.

The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there  -- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using XFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever  color you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a  mask).

My program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it.   Because X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window  would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the event without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow  errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed  and its ID reallocated to another window.  [courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?   Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually, the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that  knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except for GCs and private color cells, can be shared].  The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple  applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the applications' running on different machines) is in the first application to  create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into it. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also knows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.  [Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]  Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level  cooperation among your applications.   Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to  use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it  should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.

A number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return  the wrong child of root. A general solution is to add this code or to use it in your own application where you would normally use RootWindow(dpy,screen):  /* Function Name: GetVRoot  * Description: Gets the root window, even if it's a virtual root  * Arguments: the display and the screen  * Returns: the root window for the client  */ #include <X11/Xatom.h> Window GetVRoot(dpy, scr) Display        *dpy; int             scr; { Window          rootReturn, parentReturn, *children; unsigned int    numChildren; Window          root = RootWindow(dpy, scr); Atom            __SWM_VROOT = None; int             i;    __SWM_VROOT = XInternAtom(dpy, \\\"__SWM_VROOT\\\", False);   XQueryTree(dpy, root, &rootReturn, &parentReturn, &children, &numChildren);   for (i = 0; i < numChildren; i++) {  Atom            actual_type;  int             actual_format;  long            nitems, bytesafter;  Window         *newRoot = NULL;   if (XGetWindowProperty(dpy, children[i], __SWM_VROOT, 0, 1,      False, XA_WINDOW, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems,             &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newRoot) == Success && newRoot) {    root = *newRoot;    break;   }  }   return root; }  [courtesy David Elliott (dce@smsc.sony.com). Similar code is in ssetroot, a version of xsetroot distributed with tvtwm. 2/91]  A header file by Andreas Stolcke of ICSI on export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/vroot.h  functions similarly by providing macros for RootWindow and DefaultRootWindow; code can include this header file first to run properly in the presence of a virtual desktop.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 147)  How do I keep a window from being resized by the user?   Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but  there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. You can try setting  the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best.  [1/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 148)  How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times?   It's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself [e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped --  imagine the conflict between two such programs running.    The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily assuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do  this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup  menus or other short parameter-setting windows).  [thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu); 7/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 149)  How do I make text and bitmaps blink in X?   There is no easy way.  Unless you're willing to depend on some sort of extension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself, either by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games with the colormap and changing the color of the contents.  [Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 7/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib?   Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help  get notification of double-clicking.  There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the  protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do  client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you  have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish  implementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of  the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.  Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should be the single-click action or the double-click action.  [Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 4/93]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 151)! How do I render rotated text?    Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics  capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics libraries.  Your only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to render the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it \\\"by  hand\\\" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via  XPutImage(); more specifically:  1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.  2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).  3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.  4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where    a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)   b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)  5) render I2  Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.  The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X  also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS, although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer.  In addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph.

(How do I reserve names?)   There are places in the X Toolkit, in applications, and in the X protocol that define and use string names. The context is such that conflicts are possible if different components use the same name for different things.  The MIT X Consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains: orgainization names, selection names, selection targets, resource types, application classes, and class extension record types; and several others.

Most of the Flames neglected to show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at least five posts! The Flames best line was probably Skrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary Suter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored by D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made some bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially impressive.   The games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and never recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches, hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren Rychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men, as Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King inserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's game. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no idea how serious - he didn't return.  I still think the Flames should win this series, but they better buckle down.\",\".d. .d. I just thought of another one, in the Bible, so it's definately not because of *lack* of religion.  The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for other reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy and peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions  lying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice, peaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to mind...  I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally intended for.  That doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in the Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own stomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to kill by their leaders.  The point is that there are many things involved in religion that often lead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant side effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching between Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.    @Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest parts of Man's history.@  Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological social caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs. The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to further their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these were groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more powerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples because there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over religion that he does not have many choices.  Well, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of little silver butter-dishes.  -ciao\",\" You're getting warmer.  The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be depressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just about (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working correctly is totally drop safe.  Now, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single documented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because he failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely prevented the office from getting shot.  The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire. This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down intentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a 'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else. By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece. From the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of firing it.  The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be familiar with that particular type of firearm.\",\" It appears that Walla Walla College will fill the same role in alt.atheist that Allegheny College fills in alt.fan.dan-quayle.

I got it from a The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the editor.       Saint Aloysius Gonzaga      The Patron of Youth       The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince     Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured     soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of     Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and     honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in     the manner expected.      Saint Aloysius' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from     praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the     life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this     life.  As  Saint  Aloysius grew, he began to resemble his mother     more than his father.      Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father's     soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he     fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an     example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).      About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received     from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself     became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and     asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.      He wanted to share Our Lord's suffering to show  his  reciprocal     love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the     finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of     wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.     While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his     younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.     Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well     with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,     intelligent and always had something interesting to say.       Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint Igna-     tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)     towards which Saint Aloysius         -12-            began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the     marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.      After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in     order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even      through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the     religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.      The Marquis' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his     son:  \\\"Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-     ness?\\\" \\\"I will not, father,\\\" was the  in-evitable  reply. \\\"Then     leave from my sight and don't return until you change your mind!\\\"     With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to pray:     \\\"Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!\\\" He knelt down     to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but     this  time he was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This     at last brought the proud man to his senses. \\\"The Lord wants him,     the Lord can have him.\\\" He gave his consent for his son to become     a Jesuit.      After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-     ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and     could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-     sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare     the dying for a holy death.      Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from carrying  and     nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever     and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul to  the  Lord     while gazing at a crucifix.      Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his     humility, purity and confidence in prayer.

I disagree with this conclusion about the _applicability_ of the  Islamic law to all muslims, wherever they may be. The above conclusion  does not strictly follow from the foregoing, but only the conclusion  that the fatwa cannot be *enforced* according to Islamic law. However,  I do agree that the punishment cannot be applied to Rushdie even *were* it well founded.    Certainly putting a price on the head of Rushdie in Britain is a criminal  act according to Islamic law.     Yes.    \",\"  Are there any further stories to report on the eve' of Norm's farewell  from the twin cities? In an earlier post, it was announced that Norm  Green was given until midnight of the last home-game of the North Stars to cleanup his belongings and turn in the keys to the arena.  Did this happen? Was Norm run-out-of-town?  Rumor has it that while he was attempting to remove the score board,  the score-board fell to the ice and flattened Mr. Greedy to a large piece of green paper. Arena management had to use the Zamboni (which  they confiscated from Norm's truck) to clean-up the useless remains. \",\" I bet it suddenly started sticking when you  started leaving the PC running the menu all night.  There is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software in PC's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input via a DOS call rather than a BIOS call (as menus often use) otherwise the code to update the date after midnight never gets called.   Somebody might be able to correct the details in case I've mis-rememberred them, but I think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources) or add a TSR or system patch or something.  As far as I know the CMOS clock keeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than DOS's clock).\",\"With a sound card on interrupt 5, two serial ports (one for modem on i4, one for Miracle Piano on i3) and a printer port on i7, I have run out of low interrupts.  What I would like is a mouse port with an interrupt of 10, 11, or 12 (which ever interrupt the PS/2 mouse port uses) in in ISA i486 computer.  I called technical support of Microsoft, Logitech, & ATI (checked what interrupts the mouse port on the ATI video cards can use) and they all said the only interrupts possible on these cards was ones lower than 7.  Does anyone know of any board for an ISA bus which will allow a mouse port (or even a serial port) with high interrupts?\",\"  The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit 'fuzzy regions'.  These are described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in a three body system.  The probe was launched into this region for the earth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow down. The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without expending fuel, we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible\\\". The originator of the technique said that NASA wasn't interested, but that Japan was because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel for deceleration.   This from an issue of 'Science News' or 'The Planetary Report' I believe, about 2 months ago(?). \",\" Yes, you could.   Well, letsee (whipping out HP-48SX, soon to be GX): 6 inches/3*10^8 m/s=.5 nanoseconds resolution.  Hmm.  That'll be rather difficult!  The more standard (read: better) method is to use ultrasound, generally somewhere around 40kHz.  Sound travels a heck of a lot slower than light (radio waves), and is therefore much easier to deal with.   It might be easiest to visit a hardware store and look at the numerous \\\"sonic estimator\\\" type devices that do what you want here.  Many are pretty  cheap too -- <$30.  (In fact, for awhile the Stanley Estimator was selling for something like $8.  That's the one I bought! :-) )\",\"  One interpretation I've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin  of physically abusing one's wife.  The husband is usually physically  stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.   He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an  example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.  This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what  is God's will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals  His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some  degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding  of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the  husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.   One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband  and to the husband through the wife. \",\": Are the Serbs doing the work of God?  Hmm...  : I've been wondering if anyone would ever ask the question,  : Are the governments of the United States and Europe not moving : to end the ethnic cleansing by the Serbs because the targets are : muslims?  : Can/Does God use those who are not following him to accomplish : tasks for him?  Esp those tasks that are punative?  : James Sledd : no cute sig....  but I'm working on it.  Are you suggesting that God supports genocide?

Scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the Arena.  Best  strategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E. Taylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45, when the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell and will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.       Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on;  what's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).

(Sorry all HP fans, but I have a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their (excellent) gear).  One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is whether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock the instrument into real time capture mode.   I agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus. However, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students) seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or more knobs required of a \\\"real\\\" scope :-)   This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at least they appear to be logically laid out.  One more thing about the new, \\\"simpler\\\", front panels. These instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the instruments.

It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fighting for independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The war against Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of  the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction of Azeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60 thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place. This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule, is said in the document.     Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every effort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan, and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.    It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine, food, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees from Kelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the  sick and the wounded men.--O--   60 REFUGEES FROM KELBAJAR PERISHED IN THEIR ESCAPE LORRIES        BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, during the evacuation from Kelbajar region, 60 refugees on board two lorries were killed in the fire from the Armenian Tanks on the only road to leave Kelbajar. According to press -service of Azerbaijan president, no one survived the tragedy. --O--   SITUATION IN THE REGION OF KELBAJAR     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attempts to evacuate the rest of 15,000 citizens, encircled on alpine villages of the region of Kelbajar  went on within the last twenty-four hours. Evacuation helicopters could not land near these villages because of shelling from the Armenian side and existence of fog. Measures are undertaken to air-drop food and medicine to the encircled people.    Several hundred people succeed within the last twenty-four hours to get out of the region of Kelbajar via mountain range. Refugees are  settled in the neighboring regions of Azerbaijan and in Ganja.  Authorities face serious problem with rendering refugees medical  aid and food. The number of refugees from Kelbajar is over 40,000 people. Azerbaijan is not capable of handling a disaster of this magnitude.--0--   ARMENIAN ARMY CONTINUES ATTACK ON FIZULI     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: The region of Fizuli of Azerbaijan,  situated outside of the territory of Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag, has been subjected to heaviest attacks of Armenian army for the fourth day. About 30 armored technique and more than 500 soldiers of the enemy are taking part in the attack.    Armenian units broke the defence line of the azeri forces and occupied the ruling height from where the town is shelled from \\\"Grad\\\" installations, this morning. There is heavy destructions in the town and more than 20 people are dead. Population of the town is hastily evacuated.--0--   PRESS-CONFERENCE OF THE CHIEF OF PRESS-SERVICE OF PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Fifty-five thousand refugees from the region of Kelbajar were taken out by 11 o'clock on April 5, informed the chief of the press-service of president of Azerbaijan, Arif Aliev, today.    Journalists were also informed at the press-conference that International Red Cross is helping to accept and render refugees medical aid. There is an urgent need to supply the refugees with tents, food and medical aid.    Arif Aliev informed that as a result of the ongoing tragedy brought on by the latest aggression of Armenia, the leadership of Azerbaijan intends to appeal to Azerbaijanis and all those who treasure human life all over the world for help.    Concerning the reaction of the international community to aggression  of Armenia, Aliev said the department of state of the USA has expressed its anxiety to leadership of Armenia.    Participants of peace efforts in Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag under CSCE, Rafaelli, Mareska and Chetin strongly blamed the aggression of  Armenia against Azerbaijan.    Leader of press-service informed that tomorrow ambassador of  Azerbaijan in Russia, Hikmet Haji-zade, will conduct a press-conference in Moscow. Detailed information on latest events in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan will be given at the press-conference.--0--   AZERBAIJANIS PICKET IN FRONT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF RUSSIA     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Azerbaijanis, living in Moscow, picketed in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.

About 100 people took part in the picket, organized by Azerbaijani society \\\"Dayag\\\".--0--   PICKET OF SADVALERS IN MOSCOW     BAKU (5 APRIL) 30-40 members of \\\"Sadval\\\" society picketed before the building of permanent representation of Azerbaijan in Moscow. Picketers were demanding the return of Lezghins lands, as if annexed by Azerbaijan.    Ambassador of Azerbaijan in Moscow, Hikmet Haji-zade classified this action as provocation aimed at creating a further inter-ethnic conflict in Azerbaijan. He marked in his talk with the Turan correspondent that he does not rule out a connection between the Armenian aggression in the region of Kelbajar and this anti- azerbaijani action of the \\\"Sadval\\\" society in Moscow. He also marked that 30-40 people do not mean the Lezghian nationality in the whole.    Society of Lezghins, \\\"Sadval\\\", registered in Moscow in 1990, demands the creation of a Lezghistan state, which never existed before on the northern territories of Azerbaijan.--0--   ATTACK OF ARMENIAN UNITS STOPPED     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attack of Armenian army on the town of  Fizuli, which began in the last twenty-four hours, is stopped, informs  the press-service of the Ministry of Defence of Azerbaijan.    In the result of undertaken measures, 6 tanks and a number of  the attackers were destroyed. Advance units of the Armenian army retreated several kilometers.    Chairman of the parliament, Isa Gambar, visited the town of  Fizuli and met with commanders of the units of the national army and local citizens, today.--0--   STATEMENT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan  issued a statement in connection with aggression of Armenia in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan.    It is stated in the statement that regular units of the armed forces of Armenia captured the town of Kelbajar on April 3 .   Attack of Armenian units, which began on March 27 deep in the territory of Azerbaijan still continues. Armenia has occupied at present 7500 sq.km of the territory of Azerbaijan.    Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari (Upper) Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered a specially dangerous phase. This is the result of non-recognition of  Armenia as an aggressor by the international community, is marked in the document.    It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russian army are participating in the Armenian attack. This casts doubt on the sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict.

What    follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.     [Reproduced without permission]      The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,  where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under  the tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,  presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if  a person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group  of 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and  sugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after  drinking the artificially sweetened beverage.     The study received widespread media attention and stirred a  good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.  However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers  did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did  actually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not  necessarily go hand in hand.     In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining  the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.  And after reviewing every one of them, the director of the  Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins  University, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-  sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in  the amount of food eaten afterward.      One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing  cancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a  host of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government  has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing  everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.  Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and  after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm  that it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the  Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with  monitoring public health), the American Medical Association's  Council on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration  have given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a  clean bill of health.     Granted, the FDA has set forth an \\\"acceptable daily intake\\\" of  50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed  the limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take  in 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of  aspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,  or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...  A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams  of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups  of yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content  of selected foods omitted]     Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away  from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called  phenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000  to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential  amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child  consumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause  such severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with  PKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other  aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \\\"Phenylketonurics:  Contains Phenylalanine.\\\" \",\" code deleted...

So with S1 and S2 being used for a while \\\"batch\\\" of the unit keys, the number of used S1/S2 pairs will probably be fairly low.

The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted (\\\"why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go.\\\").   3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.    Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the  heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is normally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because  moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine  low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best.    A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the condenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the  condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too  hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs.    The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower  they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120  degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer, operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order  to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area.  At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical \\\"95-95\\\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East. It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure.   True.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard  stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves. The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water.  By \\\"impure\\\", I mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved oxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will  find outside the laboratory.

By trying to inject the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without adding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could be \\\"Is a polydactyl person a human being?\\\"  You still have not answered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.   You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies. If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule, provide it for me.   More irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does not follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out, brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights of the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant difference.  What I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the thread you started?  You got answers to your questions when you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected, changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion of substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance, why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss silly accussations, e.g. \\\"It really doesn't matter to you...\\\" If it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek some substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic and show some meaning to your words.   As others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on which has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy fails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here. A woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would not be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?   Is it?  Please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.   You simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is not accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on for size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments. But the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The systems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.   Your argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total failure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in reality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible, that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said, you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said, there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to its claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?   You haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.   Again you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and it is not as slow as you seem to think.   Yes, and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that he was murdered by a religious, \\\"pro-life\\\" fanatic.  Please do try to stay relevant.   Clever comeback.  I congratulate you on the readiness of your wit.  What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake? Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What is different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction anyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at parties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.\",\" Why not?

It seems rather weird.\",\"Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part04 Last-modified: 1993/4/15   FAQ for sci.crypt, part 4: Mathematical Cryptology  This is the fourth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.   Contents:  * In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem? * What is an attack? * What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically? * Why is the one-time pad secure? * What's a ciphertext-only attack? * What's a known-plaintext attack? * What's a chosen-plaintext attack? * In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks? * What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?   * In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?    A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a   decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of   functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of   ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the   decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that   D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption   of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key   (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext   into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to   encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.  * What is an attack?    In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method   of starting with some information about plaintexts and their   corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out   more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state   mathematically what this means. Here we go.    Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,   and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.    An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an   algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that   there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have   f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this   probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).    The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at   least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and   g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible   ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other   words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions   E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).    An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if   n = 2, and so on.  * What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?    In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.   Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this   property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem   is strong!''    In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely   formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is   strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against   all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as   defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this   statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist   any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement   to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that   the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.    Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical   definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions   we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can   figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used   properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.    The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst   can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to   construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,   and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.    * Why is the one-time pad secure?    By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the   plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)   of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive   or) of K and P.    It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial   single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform   distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform   distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,   i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,   with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and   g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of   K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also   be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is   uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p   that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus   a fortiori A is trivial.)    On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used   for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial   multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be   thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';   this explains the name ``one-time pad.''  * What's a ciphertext-only attack?    In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is   constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about   n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some   information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial   if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given   G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.    For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can   easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply   guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use   the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no   matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which   produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.   If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is   a nontrivial attack.  * What's a known-plaintext attack?    The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,   G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.   In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption   P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the   other decryption P_2.    Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature   as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the   cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him   decrypt further messages.  * What's a chosen-plaintext attack?    A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical   series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the   cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into   our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a   chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and   look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured   out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of   attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''    A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption   attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a   way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.    There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:   for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as   T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew   for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash   function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.  * In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?    Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some   plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're   also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find   K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).    If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed   on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results   only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial   attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many   possible keys.  * What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?    Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys   randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to   for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which   are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English   words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much   faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.\",\" I do not know a lot about this, except from seeing one patient with \\\"Kartagener's syndrome\\\", which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome in which there is situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic infections. \\\"Situs inversus\\\" means that organs are on the wrong side of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the \\\"normal\\\" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in absence of this, laterality can be \\\"random.\\\" People with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong side).   According to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal recessive, which should imply that on average one child in four in a family would be affected. But there may be much more current information on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking about more than one conditiion. I would suggest that you ask your pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist, of which there is probably one at NCSU.\",\"Here is an update on the Goalie mask poll...

The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they wanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.  Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining 6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks in the New Brunswick city.  The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if the season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold 1400 for this year.  SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL The Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of Saint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200 Exhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion frnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.  CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE Despite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore Skipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks, announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates. There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced a limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players including 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited farm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\",\"    Polish and Jewish are *not* mutually exclusive.    \",\"..stuff deleted... ...more stuff deleted...

Bob Wickman's pitching the game of his life through eight innings (Yanks lead 6-1), so Buck decides to let the kid try and get his first complete game. Wickman manages to get two outs, but in between, four funs score, and all of a sudden it's 6-5, and Wickman just can't get the third out. So Buck goes to the bullpen, and Farr gets out the first guy he faces.  Last night, Jimmy Key is pitching another in a long string of games of his life (this guy just keeps getting better!) through eight innings (Yanks lead 4-0). This time, Buck thinks, \\\"I don't want a repeat of that near-fiasco with Wickman, so I'll give my bullpen some work.\\\" Steve Howe, whose ERA was 54.00 coming into the game, left with it at 81.00. He didn't do too good. Then Farr comes in. He gives up a two-run homer, and the Royals win it, 6-5.  What's going on? This is already the third or fourth time this year that the bullpen has blown a lead. Farr & Howe have done it twice together, Monteleone's done it once, and I think even Habyan did it once.

I spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently,  by coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that  while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the  Church as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church  recoginizes itself as a community of believers, members of the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable to each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island, there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without the priest being present, but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area.     I remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus, married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the community.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with one another--the community should be able to rely on that  couple to be as one.   While couples may marry without witnesses, they  may NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An  anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage at all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half-hour later!!   I tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage, but I would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they intended to be married, assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a commitment, I believe, in God's eyes.   But I'm digressing....     God be with you,\",\" So in other words, if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out the Penguins, that's immaterial because it was the coaches decision? Come on, Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant. Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders.   YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**. Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.  But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel doesn't have a game like that in him.   Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about Roussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah, Dom has played well too.   FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a team picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the same picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning, Kasper...   Mostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain autographs on the team photos. I don't like that method since I've seen guards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they got their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies.\",\"   The one I got only does about 4kb/s in text and 320x200 (VGA/MCGA) mode, which is almost identical to the other W5186 based cards (ATI 68800 does about 6kb/s).  This is weird since the Orchid supposedly should be much faster (and I was told by someone that it can do almost 16 kb/s), since the VGA chip is covered by the Orchid label, I can't really tell for sure if it uses a 5286 chip, but the spec. sheet that comes with the board (no docs!) did say it has 1 meg dram and uses a 5286 chip.

Blackman, Research Coordinator for NRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89. -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear sir:  By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of  momentus \\\"scientific\\\" findings. These are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings. Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists.  The latest effort -- \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities,\\\" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying  editorial, \\\"Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,\\\" by two employees of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular order.   1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to   support the statement that \\\"some have argued that restricting  access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate  of homicide.\\\" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that  contention.    2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very  similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,  demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities  are very different with very different demographic characteristics  which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in  Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white  and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be  the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-  grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various  ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.    3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,  compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all  the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect  in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-  1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth  involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM  article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving  handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that  one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding  that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that  a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day  for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without  at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?    4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national  gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily  selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because  it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific  reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which  involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar \\\"control\\\"?  Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite  \\\"scientific\\\" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide  rate *exceeds* that of such \\\"wild west\\\" cities in Texas as  El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado  Springs. (Ref. 3)    5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or  handguns \\\"are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in  Vancouver.\\\" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending  to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is  an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry  permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in  Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of  handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun  owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number  of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns  for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns  legally for protection, registration figures are  meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York  City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,  that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population  in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver  has a greater \\\"prevalence of weapons\\\" than New York City.    The second method of measuring gun density is \\\"Cook's gun  prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity  differences.\\\" But the validation was by Cook of his own  theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a  different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is  based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement  in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking  a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide  (42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in  homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in  Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-  ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and  Vancouver.    6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and  Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that  Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to  the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian  law for owning and carrying handguns for personal  protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more  difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually  the case.    7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain  the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the  penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of   clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a  firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number  of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making  arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest  rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences  imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,  or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social  scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,  the authors of the NEJM \\\"tale of two cities\\\" fail even to mention  most factors related to crime control.    8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective  means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not  the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost  650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from  criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the  liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be  completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury  to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors  reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides  without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle  accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides  involving firearms.    9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the \\\"study,\\\"  editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it \\\"applied  scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb  advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly  handguns.\\\" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly  be mistaken for \\\"scientific methods\\\" by a sociologists or  criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle \\\"study\\\" is the equivolent  of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding  two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25  and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,  administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while  giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure  and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure,   announcing in a \\\"special article\\\" a new medical breakthrough.  It would be nice to think that such a \\\"study\\\" would neither be  funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.    Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC  make them willing to present shoddy research as \\\"scientific  breakthroughs\\\" in \\\"special articles\\\" and editorials relating  to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying  the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight  over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about  the distortions contained in \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,  and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities\\\" and \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call  for Science.\\\" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside  whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize  an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.

Wright           (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)     suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\\\"  The problem is demonstrated    by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting    to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by    the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal    of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and    suggested that a handgun ban \\\"may reduce the rate of homicide in a     community.\\\"       The nine medical doctors who published \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime,    Assaults, and Homicide\\\" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite    many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver    has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations    make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems    indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period    1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.    Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,    Why?       The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case    to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,    that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their    evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and     unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point    does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support    of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody    knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We    are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that    a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates    when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.       Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two    indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-    weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons    permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the    permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable. *     The second bit of evidence is \\\"Cook's gun prevalence index,\\\" which stands *  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index *  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in  *  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage *  of homicides and suicides involving firearms. *     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides, *  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take *  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be *  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides *  is directly related to their relative availability in the general  *  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To *  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to \\\"prove\\\" it on the basis of *  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.       Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that    guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.    The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun    ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates    reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,    that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.       In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of    violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the     consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin     Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime    for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke    an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.       Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data    on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are \\\"similar in    many ways,\\\" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law    stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish    the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that \\\"all    else is equal\\\" among things being compared. *     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look  *  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime *  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage *  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle *  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent. *  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the *  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half- *  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown *  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out. *     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is *  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates *  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide *  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver. *  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due *  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks, *  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics *  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison *  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial *  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle *  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain *  in either city.       Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the    cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority     groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in \\\"gun availability\\\"    (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not    matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why    blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed    in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,    do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)       Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between    Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have     anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol     abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city    of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the     Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the    United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian    percentage?       The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many    ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent    more detailed analysis, nearly any of these \\\"many ways\\\" might explain part    or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such    as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal. *     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide *  result in a \\\"complex picture.\\\"  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing *  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They *  also acknowledge that \\\"socio-economic status is probably an important *  confounding factor in our comparison,\\\" remarking further that \\\"blacks    *  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of *  Vancouver's population.\\\"  Given the evidence presented in the article, *  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle *  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial *  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility, *  since \\\"detailed information about household incomes according to race *  is not available for Vancouver.\\\"       The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in     gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple    example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms    of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one     would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.    Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce     crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into    account?  In this example, the \\\"hidden variable\\\" is city size: Guns are    more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city    problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the    appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very    seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities    for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,    and their results are impossible to interpret.       In the editorial \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science\\\" accompanying    the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the    authors for applying \\\"scientific methods\\\" to a problem of grave public    heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from    nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate    plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them    out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are    little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this    study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical    identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--    is cause for further concern.

Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.  I'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple's internal data structure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or they came up with their own data structure.  If it's the latter, then they won't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files, there aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime movies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk and transferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't matter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.

The Mets and Astros joined the N.L. in 1962. \",\" After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals, but before IBM had decided to respond, I argued strenuously that they  should not; they should keep it proprietary.   The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscomb was the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunately for all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above question much better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gain acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessary complexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would  authority.  In fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15  years.  We have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, invented and proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined and vetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not subject to influence by any of these.  Even now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trust the DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of the public scrutiny.  (Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to  gain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basis of authority alone.)  We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can \\\"break\\\" the DES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time they can \\\"break\\\" anything.  The important question is at what cost and in what time.  The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important as what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand the cost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way. At this point, we may never replace either because of the inability of any successor to overcome this knowledge gap.  DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography. We are damned lucky to have them.\",\"A friend has the following symptoms which have occurred periodically every few months for the last 3 years.

It is the \\\"L\\\" word - LOSER !!   That's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it is all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.   Remember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail buffer can claim they are \\\"too young\\\" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet. The eighties were about \\\"How America Learned to Win Once Again\\\". Then (wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win. No Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer (We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no holds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a few \\\"little\\\" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an S&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to contend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never had it so good.    In the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one doesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a \\\"kinder and gentler type of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of discourse about people who \\\"don't get it\\\". For those of us in the winning business, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no  suggestion of losing.   But what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our  \\\"white male\\\" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out  photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one with a \\\"Hail Mary\\\" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'three yards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses in the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the  weapon of choice these days.     Who is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on  your face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This  is known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt  sure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the  same. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to  take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?   What we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is  the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood used to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott declaimed, \\\"Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will  not tolerate a loser.\\\" And so on.    The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and Democrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some  \\\"equitable\\\" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a  loser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian homosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%)  minority.   Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most conservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care who's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say something about make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition). In the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a  \\\"neoconservative\\\" or a \\\"neoliberal\\\" depending on how much you want to limit the pot.   Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be popular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still be popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I  would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it is the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any other place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in Columbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to  see more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious  preference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of  them be white men !!

Velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside of stock airboxes on a number of bikes.  At a tuned engine rpm, the stacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air rushing in. Air momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside long after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke. Shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from escaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion chambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing) to the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they design for shock waves.\",\"  Close. My mother comes from Gainesville Tex, right across the border.

It is, however, closely regulated. In order to  purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be one of the following: a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations:  The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.  The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any  organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions  to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are: - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.  - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.  Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).  The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members' use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet.   By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \\\"F\\\" motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart C, for details.  As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute, or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.  Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.   Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.   That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest misconceptions people have about our hobby.   True. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get  hit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand. \",\"Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think it's great!  However, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answers to the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why?  Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.  I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?  Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?  Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost?  I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2?  Thanks for any comments.\",\"Hi,  My friend's 1983 Toyota Tercel accelerates by itself without using the gas peddel.

This is a triple 2-to-1 transmission-gate analog multiplexer, with positive and negative power supplies (can be run from a single-ended supply as well).  With dual supplies, the logic inputs still range from ground (0 Volts) to VDD.

When the analog switch is closed, the amp is inverting-gain-of-one.  With the switch open, it is non-inverting-gain-of-one.  You can clean up the circuit to trim out input offset current if this hurts the balance (this would show up as carrier feed-through).

Marvin Batty.\",\"My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or something. I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target, then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to harm.  But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away, heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this moment is hazy.  I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not. So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!  Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.  What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?  I eagerly await comment.

It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew must learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) The land in this country must pass into Jewish hands, i.e. to the same new Jew who has \\\"learned\\\" to work it. Both aspects of the two-pronged concept of \\\"Hebrew labor\\\" have racist connotations. On the one hand, the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical labor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other hand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the Arab farmer from the source of his livelihood.  The occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from the occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and hot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of \\\"Hebrew labor\\\" to the history books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement. It has blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to problems caused by the closure of the territories. Today too this concept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the closing of the Palestinian population.  Or in the words of Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, \\\"I have no tears for those who get rich off of cheap labor\\\". 2) to furnish an answer to the unemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.\",\" Just to make sure everyone is clear on this: \\\"it never has\\\" refers to  \\\"protects\\\", not \\\"fails to protect\\\"; i.e., in my lifetime I have never seen  the U.S. government consistently protect the interest of U.S. citizens,  except by accident. \",\" :  really involved there).

My experience of Christianity (25+ years) is that most Christians seek answers from clergymen who have little or no direct experience of spiritual matters, and that most of these questions can be answered by simple introspection.  Most people suspect that they cannot trust their senses, but few take the next step to figure out that they can trust themselves.  Not to get too esoteric, but it seems that most religions, Christianity included, are founded by particularly intuitive people who understand this.

Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it (as long as my advisor doesn't catch me - which is easy enough to do), but  stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review  committees and the peer review process in general.

If the (naive) market is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong  encryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast standard, and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard, but it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market with cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry's technology is better, the programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard. Who could compete?

One approach is simply to try and move political opinion and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Another approach is to try and amend the constitution.  The original constitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention for 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it. The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains government (particularly state and local), even though on many particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I think libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via an amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).  Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this as a problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That might be true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  If a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then falls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This is unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now, but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of, if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.\",\" Hi Janet,  Sounds exactly like mine.  Same circumstance, same onset symptoms,  same cafergot uselessness, same duration.  In fact, of all the people I know who have migraines, none have been so similar.  There is such a wide variation between people with respect to what causes their headaches, that I generally don't bother sharing what I've learned about mine, but since ours seem to be alike, here are my observations.  I don't think it's heat, per se (I've had more in winter than summer). Dehydration could conceivably figure, though.  Try tanking up before playing rather than after.

Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit (which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).

It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at 65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv) and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be cheap.    My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each compariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).  The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the compariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my circuit would not detect it.     The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this work.

Within hours, everyone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is being monitored more closely than ever before possible.  Without the tools being in place, a tyranny cannot stand. With tools like this in place, a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be successfully imposed.  Why give the government tools with which to enslave you? Maybe you can trust Bill Clinton, but are you willing to tell me that you can trust EVERY government that will ever arise in the U.S. hereafter? I am not willing to make that leap of faith.   I'm a political dissident. As such, I am acutely aware of what happens to political dissidents in most of the world. In most of the world, I could be killed for my beliefs. Call Amnesty International some time to find out what happens to dissidents in most of the world.  All that seperates the U.S. from most of those places is a thin piece of parchment in the National Archives thats being constantly more and more eroded by such farces as the war on drugs. Coups have happened in countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years. Governments throughout history have fallen. No government has lasted for more than a few hundred years. Often, they are replaced by dictatorships. Do you really believe so intensely that it could never ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and the lives of your children and other loved ones on it?  If we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced, we make it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen, because if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually stick.   Naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where hundreds that have gone before have failed. Thriving democracies led by men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen to dictatorship. Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled men before they became a tyranny.  I, for one, am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here. Only hubris would allow us to believe we are immune to what has happened elsewhere.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\"CDs for sale shipping is included  Barcelona Gold  Freddie Mercury, Tevin Campbell, En Vogue    INXS, Madonna, Eric Clapton, Sarah Brightman    ($9.00)  Wayne's World  Queen, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Alice Cooper    Eric Clapton    ($9.00)  Extreme II  Pronograffitti    ($9.00)  Saturday Night Live Band Live from New York    ($7.00)  Harry Connick, JR.

There \\\"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.\\\"          Thanx in advance... Shaz....  [I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions. The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style of the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significant differences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying text.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by hand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the original, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are generally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved, but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there's much uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error.  But I also don't think there's enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that it has much practical effect.  Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot topic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it (though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details that don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there being multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in all the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've been referring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get referenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been editions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into single narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor objects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible has long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making editions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from a variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine one of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all inaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any edition that's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is. (Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a few translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best, I'm afraid.)\",\" : Logic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you  : to believe this doesn't mean that it isn't true.  Liars can be very pursuasive : just look at Koresh that you yourself cite.  This is whole basis of a great many here rejecting the Christian account of things. In the words of St. Madalyn Murrey-O'Hair, \\\"Face it folks, it's just silly ...\\\". Why is it okay to disbelieve because of your incredulity if you admit that it's a fallacy?\",\" The key word is `spilled'.  If semen was spilled anywhere where there was a chance of procreation it was OK.  If it was spilt on the ground or in to a man it was a big sin, ditto with animals. The jews said sex=pro- creation.

Right now we have to load NetBeui.\",\"My brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly after his marriage to a domineering and insecure woman, about twelve years ago. We've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've seen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his choice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.    From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful relationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, \\\"Why be dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to come back.\\\" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I could think of.    Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and in which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was beyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not quietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their relationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung up. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is the first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if she's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with.       I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself; angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for persisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their children; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us that he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to appease an unappeasable, emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess; scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will change and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self- righteous over this bit of proof that they can't \\\"get away\\\" with treating us or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even beginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad, sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in a horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or they can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustrated because I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me up the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence, and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not free of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO* something, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting vices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal mental chatter enough to listen for God.)   Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Is this a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can I conquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him?   Here's the big question I've been evading throughout this long, long post: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, and charity, to accept the destruction of a relationship?

At  Nearly all the professors have PhDs.  I haven't had a professor who didn't, though my wife has had a couple of professors with just an M.A.  A friend had an instructor who didn't have a degree at all, but because he had been Minister of Culture for the Black Panthers, he was teaching anyway. He had a bad habit of usually not showing up to teach the class, and finally quit in disgust at the racism of a university that expected him to show up to teach.  # a university you have professors with PhDs and then Teaching Assistants (TAs). # TAs were the slave labor, graduate students who got their tuition paid, and # a few hundred a month for living expenses in exchange for doing all the grunt # work.

The orbits of the Apollo motherships changed noticeably during lunar missions lasting only a few days.  It is *possible* that there are stable orbits here and there -- the Moon's gravitational field is poorly mapped -- but we know of none.  Perturbations from Sun and Earth are relatively minor issues at low altitudes.  The big problem is that the Moon's own gravitational field is quite lumpy due to the irregular distribution of mass within the Moon.\",\" I don't claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians, but I might know more  than most.  The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots  of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now  defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.  The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the  SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they  were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.  About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once  in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as  Christ.  Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young  adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over  the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.  They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of  weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US  government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were  putting themselves in a self defense position.    In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn' t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.  If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the  local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you  some insight into where Koresh got his theology.\",\"You could argue that if you wanted, but I think a more reasonable  argument would point out the fact that the remembrance feast was very similar to the Pesach (Passover) meal during Seder, a very Jewish ritual.

I don't know if this is believeing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do not deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions from evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere is not self explanatory).   Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence,  which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The  evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning on the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason of the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly consistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the evidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself to us.  It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come through this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones providing evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for all we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for reason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired in some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense, belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.  Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source  of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by faith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding of the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be the most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity claims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the best evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.  If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while and you will see rational debate aplenty.\",\" test \",\" Well, I would guess the probability of a BMW driver having a gun would be lower than some other vehicles.

In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called \\\"stolen hits\\\", defined as a play made that \\\"an average fielder would not make with average effort.\\\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \\\"Plays Kurt Stillwell would not have made.\\\"  OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by?  To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double Plays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).  Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't take it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article.  The short version -- definition of terms HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder NEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.

Stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| Baseball fanatic\",\"Ever since the siege at Waco started the FBI spokesman has been stressing how unstable and paranoid David Koresh was.  He stressed how likely it was the the Branch Davidians would commit mass suicide.  He was concerned with the safety of the children.   What did the FBI do to defuse the situation,  Did they try to reassure Koresh?  DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD?  Did the FBI offer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working?  Did the permit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound?   What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible. They kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off their electrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their ears with loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and kept limiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure on David Koresh.   Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping to get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack the the tanks.   It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over the edge.  The blame for the deaths should be shared by both the federal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the fools at the ATF who planed the raid.   Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership have resulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people.   If every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today.

Could you give examples of privately funded ones?   Your logic certainly applies to standard investment strategies.  However, the concept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I  suspect.  I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic  benefit from Lindbergh's flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for a human powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economic benefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developed and the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the  equivalent amount of direct investment would.

Most Greeks insist even  today, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should  be called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half  a millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).'  Everyone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam' but Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name  of Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's Peking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo of the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's old colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world.  But, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul  by the name of 'Cons*.'  How can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks so different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable democracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact, for instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in 1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New  World, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence in 1776 will come 284 years later.  Shouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for  'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the  Greek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the  laurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist,  any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil  of Anatolia.  These undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It  is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows that it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock, stock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.  In fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following bloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the island of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:  The Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, the Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as  their territory. But, it has never been the possession of the government of Greece - not even for one day - in the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is located 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only  40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.  Saddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi territory and the Greek Cypriot government and  the terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus also was once part of the Greek hegemony.  Those 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront  reality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only  facts count.  As for Selanik,    <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled   particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially   as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the   total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks   led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to   the great port of Izmir.    Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual   murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek   efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912   and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,   when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>    <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow   Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to   practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923   which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new   Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a   series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where   most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This   was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting   Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also   on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica   for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By   killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a   substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting   Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the   occupation of Greece starting in 1941.    Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for   Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.   Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received   thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by   the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in   flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained   independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the   Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during   and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements   in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among   its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim   refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the   Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly   to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as   800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and   east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more   came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-   1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,   with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the   Empire.>>  [47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de   Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;   Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,   12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU   Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek   children in the streets of Salonica.

On an ironic note, where I deleted lines Emacs continually gave me the message \\\"Garbage collecting... Done.\\\"  Think it's trying to tell me something?     You lurkers can join in at any time, you know!  Ahhh.. Talk.politics.guns -- the kindler, gentler newsgroup.  Who would have thought?    I remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user. Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has only range and acurracy going for it.    I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.    That seems to be the case already, given that heavy weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low numbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks, whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.    I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the heavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders from the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large, though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated.    This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise, I would have to assume that State control would rest on the authority of the Governor and militia officers.    I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons, fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support.  Just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry. I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.    We have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble. I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in. I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.    So would I, but the resources often aren't available to outfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else.    Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton trucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units in Iowa are currently fielding in some units.   Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under State control, with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local ranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly, hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally, the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for other responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a very minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias for these functions.\",\"Pardon me for interrupting, but why doesn't anyone ever bring up other possibilities besides more government, less government, or no government and stop there? It seems to me that the problems with society go MUCH deeper than government. Democracies seem to reflective of the majority of society, both the good and the bad. If you take away the government, you still have the structural flaws in society, except this time, with no restraints. Yes? No?  Why doesn't anybody ever discuss communal society, like a kibbutz? I never studied it on depth, but from what I've heard, the kibbutz in Isreal was very successful. It is also very close to what Aristotle and Socrates believed was the best.  Sorry to detract from the discussion.   But what good is change if there is no tracable improvement in the human condition? Who would ever support the change if you tell them it won't  improve their lives? I know that there are, and will be, libertarians  who will jump in now and say that it WILL improve our lives. I can deal with that. All I'm saying is that improving the human condition must be the PRIMARY goal of any organization.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \\\"Who said anything about panicking?\\\" snapped Authur.

The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project.\",\"I have a problem with icon pixmap.

Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production( toxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well  because of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got  into Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium  would prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here. But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6  supplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).  Vitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams  per day).   1. Review Article \\\"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney      stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\\\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.     5(3):110-129(1985).  But glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both  glycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this  production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine,  but to increase your intake of vitamin B6.   2. \\\"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in       patients with kidney stones\\\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)      200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary       excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.   3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\\\" Clin. Sci. 38     :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day      showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.  For gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is  required for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for  oxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is  quite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.   The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40%  of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable  and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto  6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic  acid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the  extra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a  very early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.  Med. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day  increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg  per day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was  increased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose  and 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion  before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average  before supplementation.  B6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There  are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about  yet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the  speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must  have an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then  explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C  challenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your  intake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you  take vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient  in B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate  kidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets  absorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day  showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309 -15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase  in urinary oxalate excretion.   Here are the high oxalate foods:   1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.     Contain at least 25mg/100grams   2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale,      peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.     Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.  If the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot  of latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points  out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your  intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being  absorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn't  have to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for  males and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake). B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more  per day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).    The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day  for males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with  this low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6  requirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that  either block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6  excretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol, isoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to  supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that  increase the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking  birth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the  other drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your  dietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone  formation should be given B6 supplements.  One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your  Ca/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is  calcium-oxalate.   4. \\\"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of  patients with calcium oxalate calculi\\\"Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)   5. \\\"Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the  crystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium  interaction\\\"J. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990).   6.Review Article, \\\"Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment  of renal calcium stones\\\" J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).  There are actually about three times as many articles published in the  medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone  formation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in  stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier  post in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I  guess that he doesn't read the medical literature.

I developed my own method, which requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn method.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is several comparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.  Has anyone heard of this method before?  It is so simple, I doubt i am the first to think of it.

LOGICAL PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST'S RESURRECTION              1.  Jesus's enemies *would not* have stolen His                 body because that would have perpetrated the                 resurrection--the very opposite of what they                 desired.              2.  Jesus' disciples *could not* have stolen His                 body because Pontius Pilate established guards                 to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be                 stolen.              3.  Sadly (and ironically), many of Jesus' disciples                 did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus                 had risen from the dead.              4.  In nearly 20 centuries, no body has ever been                 produced to refute Jesus' assertion that He                 *would indeed* rise from the dead.\",\" Sorry, by \\\"they\\\" I meant autobahns, not US freeways.

For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.  Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.  The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore, the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.

Alexander Mogilny led the comeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at 3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots on goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and LaFontaine all night.  Roster move:  Andre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy scratch.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-McGill  Tommy Soderstrom  Game Summary:  Say, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!  The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the first period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that he was getting bored back there...  Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead to Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and in on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the right past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and Garry should turn down their assists :-).  The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong and kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive struggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when Terry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into the boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not a terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got a post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.  Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to give the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league didn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards the end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept missing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give the Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots were 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.  Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered a rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the season went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was Russ Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed Snider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do it all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the end of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup. He expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title the following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.  He's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \\\"outstanding\\\"). Happy with the current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable. Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus.  The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May took a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble getting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres blue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling through the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.  Then Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line and went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was all over it.  The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them. Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer took a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln't get started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the FLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and headed the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John Muckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.  But the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to just get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all over them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through Soderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it. Mistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and mistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks end for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.  Lindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking minor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get set up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended. Things evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of him. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and that meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major, 7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.  The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long they could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to Ledyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by Soderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had moved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net at 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to put it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.  The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek was strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the neutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS blue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the left circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at 18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between the 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off angles...  That was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.  Into the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the FLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in the slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he hit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.  Than an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood untouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under Soderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on, horn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange reason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...  Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS could not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through, but were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass, but twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.  But the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate out, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew in, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at 5:24 to tie the game at 4.  Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up in the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in the middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.  Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19. The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard went after it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated to the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing through the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season for Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th of the season.  Then Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres power play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the chances on the FLYERS resulting power play.  Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running  out as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres. Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found Dineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the right of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48 on his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo, and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game.  So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much in his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night (unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so). The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against with three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals despite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place since the Rangers lose the tie breaker.  A couple misc notes:  Forget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.  In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award, but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.  The Times of Trenton has reported that \\\"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\\\" has looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future.  Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he expected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back, he feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a role scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.

I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to  be able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for  granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running  3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even  a real issue. My ideal operating system:   Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize  binaries and configure on the fly, so I don't have to have  bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc...   Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac   and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which   has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in   80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips.  Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems.   Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton   or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform   or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly.  so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on    my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.   Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS  or NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.   Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have  to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch  or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.  In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight, clean kernel so you can actually understand it.

It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences. The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case. You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits?  There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently, because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor- General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting.   Some people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating food that they have harvested themselves.  The pleasure derived from hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables grown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much  freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or the supermarket).   By \\\"cannot now be justified\\\" I guess you mean that you personally don't see any justification.  Fine--but what makes your opinion so important?   Certainly the last point is correct.

Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year,     many of them are commercial businesses. The ban on commercial     use of Internet is no more.  Jack, there is a difference between using the network for commercial purposes and advertising in newsgroups.  Business communication is okay.  Advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet who have no desire to receive advertising is not okay.      Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only     by our innate good taste and no have no \\\"administrator\\\" to      guide(?) us.  I suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material not in anybody's good taste would find itself getting a lot of attention it didn't want.  You may belong to the public library, but that doesn't mean you can deface the books, disorder the stacks, or disturb the other patrons.  You're constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users (many academic and military, who get irritable about a network for which they pay with tax and grant money carrying private business advertising) follow.  There are Secret Masters here, just like everywhere else.  They're not as obvious as the ones on Prodigy, but they're here.  No doubt at some point the Internet, like everything else, will become grotty enough to carry advertising.  At that time I hope it is confined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groups---like misc.writing. \",\"Hi again,  Many thanks to all the people who responded to my request for a MS- Windows screen grabber.

It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.  WHAT'S NEW ---------- I am now running a World Wide Web archive of RIPEM information.  It does not contain much of anything that isn't available elsewhere, but it has convenient pointers to the most current version of this FAQ and some other stuff.  The URL is \\\"http://cs.indiana.edu/ripem/dir.html\\\".  This month's version has a fair amount of new pointers to information on patents and stuff like that.  I've also reordered a few things to have a more sensible ordering.  I hope I don't have to edit this again soon. :-)  DISCLAIMER ---------- Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything other than one layperson's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk to a real lawyer, preferably one with experience in patent law, export regulations, or whatever area of law is in question.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---------------------  1)  What is RIPEM?   RIPEM is a (not yet complete, but useful) implementation of Privacy  Enhanced Mail (PEM).  RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the  four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection  (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and  non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: \\\"What is PEM?\\\")   RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.  Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,  which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.   The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the  Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.  2)  How can I get RIPEM?   RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is  considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution  to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or  Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained  (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were  shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something  weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may  change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the  README file that this law not be violated:   #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution  #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,  #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.   Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is  included with the distribution.  You should read it before using  RIPEM.   RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent  residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README  file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a  product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping  distribute it.   RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \\\"home site\\\" on  ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the  U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out  how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file  GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are  available here in addition to the full source tree.  3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?   Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of  Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to  Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice  Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports  are expected, and help of users is invited.  4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?   Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend  on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users  guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM  with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.  Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU  Emacs.   If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one  in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,  and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.  5)  What is RSA?   RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means  that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to  decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,  you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your  decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public  key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to  decrypt it.  Note that the \\\"message\\\" sent with RSA is normally just  the DES key to the real plaintext. (See \\\"What is DES?\\\")   Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For  originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of  origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message  (See \\\"What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\\\") is encrypted with the  sender's private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving  authority, can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm  that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.   RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who  invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography  in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information  also may be in sci.crypt.  6)  What is DES?   DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or  secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to  encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.   RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts  your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the  recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,  allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.   DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a  key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it  should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large  corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM  standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the  near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be  stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with  interoperability.  7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?   MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.  It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,  of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not  possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a  different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,  instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,  only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.   MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example,  RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so  parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate  channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy.   MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often  used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a  passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.   MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in  RFC 1321.   There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong  a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash  function will be used if this is accepted as true.  8)  What is PEM?   PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of  encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a  working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these  documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.   RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM  specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not  handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.  9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?   For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know  your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message  received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important  that this information be accurate; if a \\\"bad guy\\\" convinces her that  his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.   RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,  the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are  described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.  None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for  key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM  is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.  10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?   This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310,  the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section  6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be  met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421  addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key  cryptography.   This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that  everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of  patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key  cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive  (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter  and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are  compressed with a patented algorithm.)  11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?   RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company  specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a  firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S.  patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:        Cryptographic Apparatus and Method       (\\\"Diffie-Hellman\\\")............................... No. 4,200,770        Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus       and Method (\\\"Hellman-Merkle\\\").................... No. 4,218,582        Cryptographic Communications System and       Method (\\\"RSA\\\")................................... No. 4,405,829        Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus       and Method (\\\"Hellman-Pohlig\\\").................... No. 4,424,414   PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key  cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for  example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.)  PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of  companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their  products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their  patents.   RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than  its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its  author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography.  However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got  interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some  people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing  code.  RIPEM even won the \\\"Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992\\\"  award.  12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?   RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography  Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the  key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as  those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys  are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were  generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.  13)  What is PGP?   PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.  PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.  PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.   A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM:   - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without    a direct network connection.   - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability    of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be    compatible with anything other than itself.   - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which    comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own    implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its    patents to \\\"make, use or sell\\\" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without    either a license or written permission.  (See: \\\"DISCLAIMER\\\")    (See: \\\"What about RSADSI/PKP?\\\")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of    PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal    action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but    it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening    in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide:     #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,     #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public    #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is    #contraband.   - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside    the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP    already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.   Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is  recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.  Unfortunately, it's not distributed separately from the program,  which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to  liability concerns.  14)  What about RPEM?   RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,  but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in  an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was  written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM.   Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many  (including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough  to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally  accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.   RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.  15)  What is MIME?   MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is  described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup  comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with  MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution  of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM  messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft  Internet documents exist on the matter.  16)  What is TIS/PEM?   Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy  Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was  rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH)  rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don't know  much more than that.  17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\",\"THE WHITE HOUSE                    Office of the Press Secretary                  (Vancouver, British Columbia)  ______________________________________________________________                          BACKGROUND BRIEFING                                BY                  SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS                             April 4, 1993                                  Canada Place                   Vancouver, British Columbia     9:40 A.M. PST                     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING  on the aid package.        SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The  President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed  yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic  and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.          Before taking your questions and running through the  basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.   First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do  with available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds  have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is  no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund  any of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently  are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin  tomorrow.              The second point is that this package is designed to  support Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package  are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have  been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian  government.              Third, the President is determined that we will  deliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed  to maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we  wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we  feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in  front of you.              Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of  trade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's  capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend  well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of  governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do  so.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make  trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.                They also agreed that there would be a new joint  commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by  Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through  the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote  a vastly expanded relationship.              If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down  the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just  give you some general background on what these programs are.   I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.              The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food  and medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has  been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian  grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure  there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the  major cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food  for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also  be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and  pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.              The second item is concessional food sales.  As you  know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship  with Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia  that we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the  Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.   The value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are  concessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out,  but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on  principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates  thereafter for the life of the deal.              The third program is a collection of private sector  support.  We think this is one of the most important things we're  going to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses  is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.   And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American  enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the  goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in  Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.                The President has also decided to create a  privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian  government in its priority objective of trying to convert state  enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has  also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a  Eurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by  prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.              The fourth grouping you see there in the summary  page is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that  this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of  pursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total  of $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed  tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're  launching.                The President is also calling for the development of  a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to  try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public  efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in  Russia.              The fifth program you see is Russian office of  resettlement.  This is a new initiative created and  conceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration  project.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military  to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic  states and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to  make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's  with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American  construction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration  basis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working  very closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say  that we have a long-term commitment to this project.                The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They  are two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our  initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the  possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and  gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in  the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much  environmental damage.              I've talked a little bit about trade and investment,  about the new group being created that the Vice President will  chair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing  with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development  committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy,  to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede  trade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time  investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this  problem full-time.                And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and  investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an  analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we  just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a  commitment within our own government to have people work on it --  senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly  important.              You'll notice that the United States is going to  support Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer  status.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested  our advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the  long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is  paramount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are  supporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting  their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.                You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in  credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended  $150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil  project.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an  agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion  framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance  Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services.  We think this is a very important development.  We think we'll  get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo  conference, the G-7 conference.              Before I take any further questions, I'd like to  defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance  objectives with you.              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major  unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts  in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and  secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory  under the terms of the START I and START II agreements.    Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important  agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding  to three important programs.  The first is the program of $130  million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement  program.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for  bomber dismantlement -- $130 million.              The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for  the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed  from the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially  contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the  construction of that storage facility.                And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help  in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear  materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we  add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance  which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall  safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety  measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the  last couple of years.                So this is an area where we will be going a lot more  work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks,  and Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last  couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for  safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian  territory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of  START I, an agreement to accede to NPT.               So we are working very hard with all the parties to  the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with  them.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia  as a very important step in that process.              Q   The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in  Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with  Kazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the  same one, why do you feel it's necessary?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same  deal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil  field.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights  oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced  today.  So it's completely new.              Q   Can you tell us more about what's involved?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like  other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do  two things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west  Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating  oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.   The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the  natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which  will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what  Russia needs.              So we think this deal is very, very good development  for Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an  American company.  And the American government has played a  leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility  in OPIC and through the loan guarantee.              Q   So it's to search and also to renovate fields  that are already there?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.              Q   On that point, should other American companies  expect to get administration support for such deals, or should  they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2  billion?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know,  Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the  U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department  and the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we  think it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th,  there will be $2 billion in financing available for American  companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.              Q   That should take up all of the rest of the  deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be  support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a  tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas  companies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and  gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will  soak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may  even extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.              Q   What's the current year budget costs of that  $2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any  current year budget costs --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer  you to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.              Q   The concessional food sales -- is there any  current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in  which the payments are due?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional  food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.   USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to  expend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd  refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.              Q   Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?              Q      and the private sector -- how many folks are  going to be involved in that?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start  with the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt  coming into office that there were literally thousands of  organization, private organizations in the United States that in  one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve  democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.   And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that  had a variety of programs in this area.  And so the  administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try  to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give  some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the  efforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.              It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will  soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in  the former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might  use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of  our own government, but the resources of the American private  sector and schools and communities across the nation.              Q      any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word  yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated  besides the $300 million the President talked about?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration  is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What  the President has done this weekend is to consult really  intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional  measures the United States could take in some of these areas to  support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he  returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other  ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.              Q   Two questions about the $700 billion  agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of  consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.   So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you  explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans  for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit  into that situation?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the  United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains  and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think  between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history  here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through  the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle  to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of  last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on  that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and  therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that  program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and  other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we  could promote American grain sales.                And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've  announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the  Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient  authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked  for a concessional loan program.                I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a  short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but  a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what  this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are  worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of  principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the  life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of  interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we  believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal  for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments  and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this  very important grain relationship, which is important for them,  and it's important for the American farm community.              Q   I gather from what you say that this could make  it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC  loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through,  is that right?               SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit  about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing   the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program  because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you  know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around  $640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having  taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American  market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to  respond to a specific request from the Russian government for  major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the  grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there,  we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to  great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with  the Russian government and arrived at this solution.                I think the Russians are pleased because it provides  them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on  the short-term payments.              Q   Where do those funds actually come from?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the  Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's  authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do  not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want  to make that general point again:  Everything in this package,  the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been  allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration  can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very  important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year,  that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be  able to do so.              Q   How did you arrive at the figure of $700  million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually  have a range from 0 to --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason  for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us  that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and  harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the  shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the  harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the  same level of food imports from the West.              Q   I would imagine there's going to be some  considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other  republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.   Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for  the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with  some of the other republics?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very  conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending  American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet  Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the  area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that  you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and  roughly 50 percent to the other countries.               In the area of food sales, we have been active with  Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We  will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this  summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the  other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are  productive and they're hard-hitting.              Q   Has anything happened at the summit to lead  American energy companies and other companies to believe that  Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of  taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our  primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not  only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd  like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're  convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to  support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of  Western governments have the financial resources over the next  decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private  sector can do that.                We look at our own society and we see tremendous  capability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very  good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial  investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new  technology and new capital to finance new production.                That's what the Russian government has told us it  wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis  on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on  the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently  last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President  Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong  signal to the American business community that we support their  efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex- Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to  support them.              Q   My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to  deliver on making Russia a more --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I  would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr.  Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas  sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice  President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the  barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil  and gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that  committee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to  the work.              Q   What type of mechanism is already in place to  administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will  the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of  the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the  Russian government for distribution at their will?                   SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking  about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the  program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working  through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure  that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to  the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the  Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can  account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of  months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of  these programs.              But they are all quite different.  For instance, in  the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it  is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of  the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working  through Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the  housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers,  we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the  democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian  private individuals and private foundations.  We're working with  journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have  noticed.              So we literally have here 30 to 40 different  activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be  carried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the  Russian government, some with Russian citizens.              Q   The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and  on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the  President has to do on that?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George  noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in  the relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's  fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we  return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and  we'll get back to the Russian government.              Q   You were not prepared for these questions when  you got here?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared  for these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not  prepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require -- let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require  consultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with  the American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those  concerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before  we take any action.              Q   Is this package designed so that you will not  have to go to Congress for anything at this point?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the  beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all  the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.   So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to  seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In  effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the  agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And  that's the advantage of this particular initiative.              Q   If this, as the President says, is a long-term,  long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment  heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to  Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are  prepared to go to Congress for various things?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been  clear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with  President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American  funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a  major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by  Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that  delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.   And we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where  it stands now.              Q   We've been told repeatedly that a number of  these items represent different or new ways of spending the money  already appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these  items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways  that it was not previously set to be?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've  said that these are all projects that either Congress had  allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were  some funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this  administration took office and had some new ideas about how the  funds might be expended.              We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or  the FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations -- Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to  further our programs.              And example of that is the Food for Progress  concessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of  funding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we  looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American  market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we  found it.              Q   Where, for example, are you getting the money  for this Russian officer resettlement --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the  Freedom Support Act funds.              Q   In other words, all of the money is being  directly spent in new ways, so to speak --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant  projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the  second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if  you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that  total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act  funding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year  '92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the  legislative history of those funds.              Q      cooperation --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I  don't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.              Q   Could you tell us please, has anything happened  here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and  Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's  happened here --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents,  President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this  issue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security  and arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's  session.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly  reinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been  talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple  of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the  discussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very  important negotiation that's been going on essentially between  Moscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially  discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute  to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.                But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend,  I don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.              Q?     Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is  any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current  year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been  earmarked and put it into this fund?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and  mirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We  could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included  out-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to  many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the  privatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already  talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.                We could have put in really big numbers and this  could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:   This package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're  going to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President  feels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy  that the western governments, the combination of governments, put  up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not  able to meet them, we're determined, and the President is  determined, to carry out every single program in this package.   And we'll do it.                But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's  part of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking  for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively  support reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment  on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.              Q      taken it way from any --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.   Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds;  so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in  Russia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.              Q   In terms of funding, there is no available  monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money  somewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I  don't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the  example is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit  guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay  back within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt  problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we  looked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement  for grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and  also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers  have a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply  look for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative  authority to do it.  This program has been successful in other  areas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union,  but we thought we should now.                 Q   Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package  for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by  initiatives put forward by President Bush?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think  that's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were  appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This  administration took office and inherited some obligations that  the Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven  week review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments  that had been made by the previous administration.                But we have gone well beyond them in funding the  enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not  been filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to  it.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them  into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say,  is another Clinton initiative.                Further, we listened to the Russian government and  listened to the Russian military who told us that the  resettlement of their officers was important to them for  political and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton  has responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment  that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out  a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.                I would also say that the President has given  impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly  about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we  have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends  itself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the  creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative,  we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private  sector as well as the American government, to achieve that  objective.                So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And  as most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the  last administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last  administration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton  assistance package for Russia.              Q   There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the  past has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this  outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money  will not just disappear because it's being administered by the  Russian government?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I  know that the President and other senior officials of our  government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and  that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's  intended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the  State Department will take great care in making sure that the  funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their  source.              I would not that this package is not simply a  package of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of  these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are  going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals,  with businesses.  The private enterprise support is another  example of that.              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add  a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one  area that we've been looking at very, very closely is  consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting  for these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely,  of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime  contractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of  a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that  funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in  Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent  efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.              Q   When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly  when do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President  is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think  it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over  the next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties  on May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over  the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach  out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us  to help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said  that we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate  in a much more effective way the activities of our own  government.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in  Russia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw  them together and to focus their efforts.              Q   Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will  actually be spent in the United States by American made goods?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any  figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something  up in the next couple of days on that.              Q   This figure is larger than the figure that has  been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result  of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think -- unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and  I'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put  us to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was  briefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the  intellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of  the ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we  had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have  been refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week  going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in  Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.   And so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been  together for about two weeks.              Q   Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There  was so much talk before about the President wanted to get  Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.   Is that in the out years?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.   President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance,  that support for the creation of private businesses is important  to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is  important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize  the state industries is important to them.                And so what we did was to try to make those the  centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We  listened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been  working with the Russian government for months on this trying to  work out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of  these programs was involved every step of the way.                But let me get at the other part of your question.   The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader  set of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking  for his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the  table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in  housing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to  consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other  allied governments that are also active.              Q   There's essentially nothing that happened in  the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that  you came in with?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular  package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks  ago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on  the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've  primarily talked about future, about what more the United States  and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia,  which is our base objective here.              Q   I noticed that you -- that money appropriated  to train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me  what about job training for workers who are displaced by  privatization?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we  have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and  financial services in the United States.  Part of the housing  initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain  Russian officers who are retiring into other professions.              Q      money for job training for workers whose  jobs are disappearing because of privatization --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet  allocated any money for that.              Q   Why not?              Q      of the $6 million is going to build 450  housing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the  Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do  housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework  of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've  got to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think  about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also  retraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming  out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.   We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers  as well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian  government.              Q      of the $6 million will go to retrain --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.              Q   Are you talking about apartment buildings or  single --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about  single, individual dwellings.              Q   You're saying that only 450 families will be  served by this?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I  thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.   What we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the  Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building  housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with  a huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next  couple of months and try to figure out with American  organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job  done.                I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.   And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into  this in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to  spend the money wisely.              Q   What is it about this program that convinces  you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be  in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back,  especially considering their other debt problem?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think  it's important to note that the United States on its own does not  have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.   It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to  our allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what  the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We  can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do  so, which is consistent with our national interests.              Q   Did the President say that the value of the  U.S. contribution was that it would create security and  prosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this  program that does this?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to  go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia,  and that is we want to do everything we can to support the  continuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay  in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear  forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction,  which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in  Russia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that  this program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we  have to make a long-term commitment to it.              Q   And then on the question of Russia's ability to  repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15  years from now?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian  government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping  is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve  their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency  revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years  from now to pay back those loans.              Q      substantial government-to-government loan  we've ever gotten into with the Russians?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to  answer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years  on this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because  the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to  just ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of  effort.              Q      government loans in any other sector that  you recall?  I know it wasn't done in --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair  to say this is a new and unique effort.\",\"  The problem is that the pins in the ADB connector  are close to each other, and if you happen to bend the cable a little while inserting it, you short the ADB port.

With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land.     \\\"There is a fear - a real fear, too,\\\" said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette. \\\"We have one generation to do it or to die.\\\"     Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land. But for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.     Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where \\\"historical sites\\\" are sometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three Zoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians, Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the Zoroastrian prophet.     Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are  a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a people is very much on their minds.     Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they actually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children become totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than the world at large - who will be the losers.     \\\"It's important to have an identity,\\\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose, a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \\\"It's important for everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life. You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect. You can fall back on your own identity.\\\"     For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.     Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was only one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.  _Good vs. evil_     Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with the good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity, kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.     But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to follow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact, Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths, traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of Mount Hamilton, is \\\"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\\\"     So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India, where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape persecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy; the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.     About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India and Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state where others had no rights.     Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \\\"good deeds\\\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose, the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because Manou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.     The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an Iranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples in North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount Hamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto, and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on this continent.     Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the property already had a large house that they have converted to a community center.     The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet  Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted  ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.     Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are  sometimes called \\\"fire worshippers,\\\" they actually consider fire just  a symbol of God.  \\\"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the  cross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\\\" Bhujwala said.     The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all Iranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With Zoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.    For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people came to worship and revel.     \\\"The good things in life are not forbidden,\\\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani, a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed proved him right.     Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit and nuts.     Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \\\"People eat the fruit,\\\" Tarapore said.  \\\"It's a way to participate in the ceremony.\\\"  _Santa Claus, sort of_     The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white hair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green symbolic of spring) and red.     He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and played a tambourine.     The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \\\"This is all new for us, too,\\\" one told a visitor who asked what was going on.     A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his people's religion.     But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the San Jose temple whenever he can.     \\\"When I first heard about this religion,\\\" he said, \\\"I thought, my God, this is what a religion should be.
