Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration rate for violent crimes.  So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism present.  There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.  Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt blacks.  In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).  Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.  Blacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences, except in the South, where they receive around 20% less on paper!!    --  There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of environmental disaster.

I have the conner set to the master, and the quantum set to the slave (doesn't work the other way around).  I am able to access both drives if I boot from a  floppy, but the drives will not boot themselves.  I am running MSDOS 6, and have the Conner partitioned as Primary Dos, and is formatted with system files.  I have tried all different types of setups, and even changed IDE controller cards.  If I boot from a floppy, everything works great (except the booting part :)).  The system doesn't report an error message or anything, just hangs there.  Does anyone have any suggestions, or has somebody else run into a similar problem?  I was thinking that I might have to update the bios on one of the drives (is this possible?).  Any suggestions/answers would be greatly appreciated.  Please reply to:\",\"The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in  x-Soviet Armenia is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan.   The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre are in 'Milliyet' today.  69 year old Hatin Nine telling:  -''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''  72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:  - ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.   Turks, you must die.''  28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:  - ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of     my eyes.''  Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming? Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?  The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British Journalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.  Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these \\\"lies.\\\" They are saying \\\"exaggeration.\\\" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's 3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...  The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.  Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.  Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''  The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human rights violations. International reactions must be made with international cooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming to be civilized.  Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where is the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals, journalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such as France who are fast to claim leadership of \\\"human rights?\\\" Where are you?   Serdar Argic\",\"Following a series of miscarriages, my wife was given a transfusion of my white cells. (The theory as I understand it is that there is some kind of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as it normally would a \\\"foreign\\\" body. Where this blocking is deficient, the body evicts the \\\"intruder\\\", resulting in a miscarriage. The white cells apparently enhance the blocking capability.) Following the transfusion, she successfully carried the next pregnancy to term, and Jake is now an active 9 month-old who cannot wait to walk.      We're now thinking about having another child, but no one (including the OBGYN who supervised the first transfusion) really seems to know whether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive pregnancies.

I am familiar with    the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally    I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use.    If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do    fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is    a long and painful experience.   What I hate about GUI's:   - Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess    I have a strong one-handed preference.

I guess I need to get one of those mice with, like, 20 buttons  or something and then I will have the best of both worlds.\",\"    Now this is getting interesting!  I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some reason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean the raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:  1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was  pretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right now.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the \\\"great judgement\\\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day). I was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my \\\"soul\\\" (which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?  2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms  that my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My physical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be tortured for all eternity?  3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical place to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth? Do you think we could find it if we dig?  Mark Schnitzius schnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu Univ. of Central Florida  [There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur until a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the meantime, some believe that people \\\"sleep\\\" until the final resurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe that souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then. There are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.  The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a different \\\"technology\\\" than the current one, one which is not mortal. (Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus' resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not subject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other, but I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don't think I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be some analog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky.  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension, outside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have little in the way of details.\",\"I would doubt any civil rights case would be in order for the point that you mentioned.  Even if it were possible, I think it is a bad idea since it smacks real strongly of double jeopardy.  A civil case for damages is fine since that is a trial that would proceed regardless of the first.  I think a bad precedent has already been set in the King trial in L.A. and something like this would make it worse.  Regardless of how bad anybody feels about this decision, it must stand that charges of assault were not not proven against the three marines and that's how it should stand.

Certainly this was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being likely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either confused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the chain inside SGI was misleading them.   There were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came out at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The chassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  I'd say 4 years was a pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and age.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the hardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our minds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost from the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in the form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over its lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.   Please, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support or sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks to misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there will be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available, but that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you are referring to).  Yes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters, but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result in good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into systems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing* you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)   They don't get all that long a lead time either; although certainly they get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions may well influence the end product, but that also is life in the industry.  We can't design systems that meet just their needs, or we won't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we don't have some niche products, like Reality Engine).   But surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five year period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period?  That's a rather unreasonable expectation, in my experience (with workstations/microcomputers).  Supported, and parts available, yes, but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!   I missed your first posting, but as I say, by all means share your frustation with somebody at a level inside SGI where it might have an effect (not immediate, I'm sure, but complaints aren't going to be ignored, and *may* affect future plans, if we  hear similar things from more than one person/site).

I tried to E-Mail you with some comments on them but my mail server does not recognize your address.  Could you E-Mail me with some info on how to get E-Mail to you?  Thanks!\",\"I have the local bus card also, and don't have any such problems with it now, but this is the second card I've gotten - the first card didn't work in VGA mode correctly.  Maybe they still have some quality control problems. I would suggest checking with ATI (I went through the vendor I bought the card from since the problem showed up immediately).  I never was able to get through to ATI's technical support number.    I sure like the way the card performs though.  I have the 2MB ATI ultra pro - local bus, and it is fast even in 1024x768x16bpp mode.

The differences in cost of production will determine local vs smuggle.   Those of us who have actually made semi-autos (full-autos are easier) are getting quite a giggle out of this.  I'd estimate that 5% of the people at my high school couldn't do it.  (I was one of the few who failed shop.)  People who have actually seen me do mechanical work would probably say that 1% is more like it.  Starting with even 90% of the population, you can be sure that \\\"enough\\\" people will be motivated.   How much is \\\"through the nose\\\"?  After all, we know quite a bit about how much a gun is worth to a criminal, so if that is dwarfed by the price demanded by the \\\"bad\\\" part of that 90%....  The relevant economic analysis has been made.  The \\\"profit\\\" of gun crime is high enough that the price required to push criminals out of the market is high enough that everyone will be motivated. That analysis ignored some \\\"improvements\\\" in the criminal gun market that could make them even cheaper.  (They're not efficiently used now, but a \\\"loaner\\\" set up would drive the value still higher without affecting criminal use.)  -andy\",\": >     I'm a commited Christian that is battling with a problem.

I did however call my local Apple dealer and he said that the he thinks the serial numbers of the machines that are covered begin with either 70 or 53-56, and maybe one other.  He also told me that Apple had extended the service on these serial numbers for another year!!!    So there is still hope - Get those monitor in!!   \",\"I can only comment on the Kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasant surprise is Alex Zhitnik. He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but he's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he were more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided  to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be MVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the league's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the  rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer goals than Hartford.

If you've got $20,000 per seat and high-end hardware, Gain Momentum might be a good choice.  It isn't compatible with HyperCard, but has a similar architecture (and *way* more functionality).  I don't have contact information, but they were recently purchased by Sybase who shouldn't be too hard to find.  If you're running News on SPARC, check out HyperLook (hyperlook@turing.com).  It uses Postscript as a scripting language which is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting, but not so good for non-programmers.  It was $995, last I heard.  You might also look at our product MetaCard.  We're alpha-testing direct importing of HyperCard stacks (we've even made the test release available for anonymous FTP), so we're obviously the closest in functionality.  MetaCard runs on most UNIX workstations and costs $495.  Email to info@metacard.com for more details.

These have been popular, especially in Europe, to treat \\\"capillary fragility\\\", and seemingly in even more extreme cases-- a few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he'd had hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously, I asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active ingredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical sputtering.  I have no idea how he's doing hemorrhoid-wise these days. The studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in human disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the reports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.  This stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there's little risk of trying it, but I wouldn't expect much of a result. \",\"  Are you volunteering? :)   Will NASA have \\\"available landing sites\\\" in the Russian Republic, now that they are Our Friends and Comrades?  \",\"  Yes.

Strictly, a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change state, according to the inputs.  A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are three inputs required.  A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable input, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all outputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output will be low).  An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to select which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since you have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.  A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use the fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the four enable lines.  Of course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the four final stage decoders.  Please give me the credit when you submit your homework.

I of course don't know the exact situation, and anti-depressants may work, but it isn't helping the ringing at all, is it?    Mine started about three years back.  Turns out I have tinnitus bilateral (translation: ringing in both ears, basically ;).  If this is what it is, she'll probably get used to it.  It would keep me up and drive me nuts too, but nowadays, I have to plug both my ears with my fingers to check to see if they are ringing.  Usually they are, but you get so used to it, it just gets tuned out.  Yes, this is what I've read about it... not just from my own personal experience.    Millions have it, according to my physician.  You just learn to cope with it (like I mentioned earlier) by ignoring it.  It eventually becomes unconscious.  The doc also said it could be caused by diet (ie: too much caffeine) and stress, but I haven't changed my lifestyle much, and it just comes and goes (it is always there somewhat, but now I rarely notice it when it really \\\"kicks in\\\").  Also, it doesn't necessarily mean there is any hearing loss, either caused by it or causing it.  I had an ENT (ear/nose/throat) exam, and passed.  In fact, my hearing is quite good considering I don't take as good of care of my hearing as I should.  Her reaction is normal.  If it is tinnitus, chances are good she'll begin to not even notice it.

Anyway...)   The basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of Mary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles  and all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were present when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days later, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was still unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There was no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their   preaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently  considered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the apostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of the assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.\",\"  So how much would it cost as a private venture, assuming you could talk the U.S. government into leasing you a couple of pads in Florida?   \",\"I've been troubleshooting the existence of way too many General Protection Faults on a 486-33, Eisa-VLB, system.

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and  Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses  each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin  June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours  per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.   Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact  Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below.   ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.        ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## #######################################################################               JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon  University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:  1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.   FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

Other questions:  - Excuse my ignorance, but is \\\"Texel\\\" a reputable maker in the CD-ROM   market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive?  - Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?

The moderator of the firearms-politics mailing list, Karl Kleinpaste, has agreed to set up an anonymous ftp archive directory for RKBA related information.  This directory can be used for things like articles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions, the RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It's not meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.  So, in the future if you're looking for something check there first and then ask here.  Instructions:  Short version for techies:  The site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the directory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands get, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command \\\"type binary\\\" to be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved to the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.  I will maintain an index which you should get first to check if the file you want to read or write already is archived.  Long version for non-techies:  In order for you to use this archive your computer must be on the Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:   ftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu  If that doesn't work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp command is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a login:  Name (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):  Instead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:   ftp  Next you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:   Guest login ok, send e-mail address as password:  I would enter:   l.v.cipriani@att.com  You'll enter your own e-mail address.  You'll get these lines or similar as output:   Remote system is UNIX.  Using binary mode to transfer files.  Next, the command prompt is printed:   ftp>   If you do not get the line \\\"Using binary mode to transfer files.\\\" Run the command:   type binary  Now you're logged in to the archive machine.  There are many directories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are   /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba and  /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming  There are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.  When you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:   cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba or  cd pub/firearms/politics/rkba  To submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with the command:   cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming or  cd pub/firearms/politics/incoming  Once you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter another command.  To find the names of the existing files in the directory you are in run the command:   ls -l  This will produce something like:  total 6021 -r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP -r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX -r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies -r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361 -r--r--r--  1 karl          8958 Jun 16  1992 WSJ_Crimestrike -r--r--r--  1 karl          2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias -r--r--r--  1 karl           935 Mar 22 22:38 academics -r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu ... and so on ...  Each line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields are the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of the file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need to be concerned with.  To get a file run the command \\\"get\\\" followed by the name of the file you want, for example:   get INDEX or  get noduty  After the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:   Transfer complete.  19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)  You can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive. You can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the file you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025 you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it:   cd congress/103rd  get HR1025  Once you're finished you can log off with the command:   quit  If you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little different.  First of all you should find out if the file already exists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  The index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba directory.  For example:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- File: whitemanslaw  White Man's Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985 Reason magazine ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Once you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login and change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once you are in the incoming directory use the command:   put file_name  In this case:   put whitemanslaw  Again there'll be a \\\"Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered in so many seconds\\\" message.  Now your file is on the archive machine.  Another thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure there isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same as the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'll overwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message].  Your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory.  Once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for the INDEX file and I will add it to the file.  If you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and I'll take care of the rest.  If you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so be sure to let me know first.  If you have any questions feel free to ask me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --  Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com     \",\"Are the Serbs doing the work of God?

As soon as you possibly can.  The difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally, any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  The remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from a wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (Occupational Safety and Health Service): \\\"Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and Rehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide\\\".  First, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands): (note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)    RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries   OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI   CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI   WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI   CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)   Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.   Pronation: Turning the palm down.   Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.   Supination: Turning the palm up.   Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.   Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.   Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.   Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.   Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.   Abduction: Moving away from the body.   Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.  Now then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse conditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles, tendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt. Diffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle discomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily \\\"the problem.\\\"  --- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory.  Normally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict the blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power, you're completely restricting your blood flow.  Without fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out, then they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates nasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.  Once one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the load.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow, and the cycle continues.  Another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves.  They need blood too.  Anyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor ergonomics, only make things worse.  --- Specific injuries you may have heard of:  (note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute injuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)  Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to cause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability to lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets inflamed, and you've got your problem.  Tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating, and can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more swelling, and more pain.  \\\"Sub-acute\\\" tendonitis is more common, which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse with repetitive activity.  Carpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include feeling \\\"pins and needles\\\", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation. CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.  Adverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere. AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS  disorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy  (brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).  Others: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for a way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS conditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you may have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).  ==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment  The most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax. If you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out the world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work: every three minutes take a three second break. EVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every three minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings, calm down, and relax.  If you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and relaxation are really a big deal.  There are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce inflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen your muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold contrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's best for you.  --- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was written in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from Appendix 10. -- dwallach]  . Let your shoulders relax. . Let your elbows swing free. . Keep your wrists straight. . Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward. . Keep the hollow in the base of your spine. . Try leaning back in the chair. . Don't slouch or slump forward. . Alter your posture from time to time. . Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.  Set the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There  should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees, and your thighs should not slope too much.  Now, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest.  Now, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in the hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area.  If you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning back, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.  [Now, I diverge a little from the text]  A good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, go find a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle, back height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in the way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good store and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you. In the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend \\\"Just Chairs.\\\"  The name says it all.  --- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:  There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some people, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you shouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your keyboard to be \\\"right there\\\".  If you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid pronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads may or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and look at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It's often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands.  Some argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.

It could have been another metaphor, for instance Ezekiel was mad at his landlord, so he talked about him when he wrote about the prince of Tyre.  Sorry, but my interpretation is more mundane, Ezekiel wrote about  the prince of Tyre when we wrote about the prince of Tyre.

Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence \\\"ESC [ 1 B 7\\\"  would indicate that the \\\"HOME\\\" key was pressed, with the shift key down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such as \\\"shift-Return\\\".  If anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code in the source file \\\"x11term.c\\\".  Maybe if someone at OSF is  interested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about  emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods  somewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.  Notes:    * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create    its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which     includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.   * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2    [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].  The patches are    in a chunk of code between '#if sun ... #endif' but could     easily be adapted for anything else. \",\"If gamma ray bursters are extragalactic, would absorption from the galaxy be expected?

Around the base of the hourglass is a ring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser in the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for draft generation.  It should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on both fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at  locations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part time, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit. It was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish. Fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent, usually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically takes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed  to cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.\",\"Excerpts from netnews.sci.electronics: 16-Apr-93 Re: What do Nuclear Site's .. by R_Tim_Coslet@cup.portal.

Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins   by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.  9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder    them in.  10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.  11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and    the other large chip just to the right of the processor and   figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a   simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole   in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using   insulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat   sync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.   12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.

Everyone,  Since some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from 4 points, I suddenly recalled a problem which is how to find the ellipse from its offset. For example, given 5 points on the offset, can you find the original ellipse analytically?  I spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year, but I failed. Under the pressure, I had to use other method - nonlinear programming technique to deal with this problem approximately.  Any ideas will be greatly appreciated.

You are supposed to train with a .22 for the 6 months, THEN you can start with anything bigger.  Drivers licence: Forgot that USA is THE land of cars..... Getting one in Scandinavia (and northern europe) is not easy. Average time is about 20 hours of training, and the cost is rather...... But we think this is acceptable because a car is NOT a toy, and bad drivers tend to hurt OTHERS. (If you are really bad, you WON'T get a lincence!)  Abuse by the goverment: This seems to be one of the main problems; Any harder gun-control would just be abused by the goverment.(!) Either some of you are a little paranoid (no offence...) OR you should get a new goverment. (You do have elections??)  Guns 'n Criminals: MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen. Known criminals can NOT buy weapons, that's one of the points of gun control. And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia (and most of europe), we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns.  Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one: What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS! Someone said that if we 'ban' guns we'd have to ban cars to, because they 'kill' to... I don't think we should argue on this one..... ;)  The issue (I hope..): I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem. Guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is.... (and what are they for??)  I think this discusion is interesting when you think of (ex)Jugoslavia: They should all have weapons, it's their rigth to have them, and if they use them to kill other (Innocent) people the problem is humans, not guns.  If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem, it's the 'axer' ?? (An example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)  Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect themselves. Is this a good situation ?? Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??  If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)  Don't flame the Englishmen because of Northern Irland, they have gun control that works (in England) and fonds from USA are one of the reasons why IRA can bomb innocents...

I recently switched my 3.5\\\" drive to A:. The problem is, while I can read and write to both the new A: and B: correctly, I can't boot from a floppy in A:. I've checked the CMOS settings; it is set for Floppy Seek at Boot and Boot  Order A:,C:.   Once, I had a floppy that did not have the systems files on it in A:. I got a message telling me to put a disk systems disk in the drive. It didn't work. When I do have a systems disk in the A: drive, this is what happens: 1) Power-on and Memory Test; 2) A: light comes on 3) B: light comes on, followed by a short beep; 4) HD light comes on for an instant; 5) B: light comes on again, then nothing happens  The light goes off, there is no disk activity of any kind, and the screen  blanks. I can't even use ctrl-alt-del.  Any suggestions.  Thanks in advance.\",\"About two months ago I purchased the Adaptec ASW-410 driver for use with a CD-ROM drive.  At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with CD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver (I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now find that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled correctly by the ASW-410 driver.  So, should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their FAX number?  Any assistance appreciated.  Regards  BTW: everything else works fine, certainly seems that Sony have caught up with      the rest with the 641.\",\" Yes, I do.  A couple of years ago, I did a comparison of the two products.  Some of this may have changed, but here goes.  As far as a PHIGS+ implementation, Figaro+ is fine.  But, its PHIGS! Personally, I hate PHIGS because I find it is too low level.  I also dislike structure editing, which I find impossible, but enough about PHIGS.  I have found HOOPS to be a system that is full-featured and easy to use.  They support all of their rendering methods in software when there is no hardware support, their documentation is good, and they are easily portable to other systems.  I would be happy to elaborate further if you have more specific questions. \",\"-*----  Ming-zhou Liu's main problem is that he has an incompetent physician -- himself.  This physician has diagnosed a problem, even though he probably has never seen the diagnosed disease before and has no idea of what kinds of problems can present similar symptoms.  This physician now wants to treat his first case of this disease without any help from the medical community.  The best thing Ming-zhou Liu could do is fire his current physician and seek out a better one.\",\"I appreciate if anyone can point out some good books about the dead sea scrolls of Qumran.

Bull Pucky you chicken! Read the service manual and get your head out of the sand! Certainly there are tools for the job that are cheaper than an alignment rack, that do the job as competently (albeit, not as swiftly), if not more accurate, due to the natural pride an owner/mechanic places on his work. You can do an `acceptable' job of aligning a car using simple tools and some imaginative work that would *never* have the effect of endangering anyones life. The worst that happens is that your tires wear oddly (well, you could have the wheels aiming TOTALLY pigeon toed and not be able to steer the car, raise your hands those that think their vision is so poor that they would screw up this badly!)  I bet you are one of those people that feels that honing a cylinder wall with sand paper will kill millions of people. It aint magic. Go take the certification course, and look at the people that have never learned to add in their whole life that are taking the certification!  BTW, I am disgusted at the Colt (and some of the other Chrysler offerings) because they go out of alignment if you sneaze at them. My '84 Chrysler Laser (Similar to the Daytona, a reskinned Colt) needed a realignment every 3 months ... Bolt a good grade 12' 2x4 to each wheel, using a carefully welded spacer jig. Measure toe in, adjust to manufacturer specs. Camber a bit more difficult to adjust and measure ... I used a micrometer to measure the space between the rim and a funky bent up pipe that could be placed on upper and lower portions of the rim on the inside of wheel (hard to explain). This same tool could be used instead of the 2x4s.  I had made these tools up *right* after the last alignment done professionally so I had a reference that the original poster might not ...\",\" Please, PAY ATTENTION. I, and others, were referring to TOTAL HOMICIDE DEATHS, NOT JUST HANDGUN HOMICIDES.  In terms of how likely are you to be killed, (regardless of how it's done, 'cause DEAD is DEAD), the UK has a higher homicide rate. Period.  You are more likely to be killed in the UK than in Switzerland.  If you were to be murdered with a handgun, then yes, Switzerland has a higher rate.  But, to belabor the point, you are MORE LIKELY to be murdered in the UK. In that sense, the weapon is irrelevant.  The UK is more violent, period.

Probably because you have yet to respond to the refutation I've posted.    Teel, it's bad enough you post this bs, it's even worse that you don't    even try to defend it when it gets torn to pieces, but then posting    that no one's looked at it and gloating when all facts point to the    contrary point to a severely deluded mind.  What I found interesting about Conklin's letter is the  6 cases he has won against the IRS.  Now, assuming that these cases really exist and were one by him (anyone checked?) they may have nothing to do with his major tax claim.  The IRS fought one of his deductions.

I don't know whether anybody formulated and proposed such an  index or criteria to determine the magnitude of a genocide as mentioned  and advised by Toynbee. If one ever does you will easily see the magnitude  of the crime of genocide committed by the Armenians, by massacring an alien population under their rule which constituted about 40% of their total population and they did it only within a time period of a little over two years in which they enjoyed having full control over this population.  Now I would like to ask you:    Is there any other genocide in the history of mankind similar to    this one?  And again I would like to ask you:    Whether the silent and unmourned martyrdom of these hundreds of thousands   of Turks of the Republic of Armenia who were exterminated as a \\\"Final   Solution\\\" to Turco-Tartar problems in Armenia is similar or not   to the martyrdom of six million Jews in Europe as a final solution to   Jewish problems?

(Or is it only applicable in cases like this?)  :-  I remember an article of about a year ago which stated that besides his wife, Saddam also has a mistress.  Assad's brother has a wife and *several* mistresses, and those 'emirs' in the Gulf have, within their lifetimes, wives in the double digitas (only they manage to keep four at a time).   This is all irrelevant.  It takes a *lot* more than infidelity to make these leaders ruthless and corrupt.  Maybe Netanyahu thought he could 'cleanse' himself by making such a public confession.  Does the average secular Israeli care, though?  The Mossad probably applauded him.  :-) \",\"  Wrong information. They just announced that Suhonen has made a deal with  Jokerit.  \",\"  I agree, I reckon it's television and the increase in fundamentalism.. You think its the increase in pre-marital sex... others thinks its because psychologists have taken over the criminal justice system and let violent criminals con them into letting them out into the streets... others think it's the increase in designer drugs... others think it's a communist plot. Basically the social interactions of all the changing factors in our society are far too complicated for us to control. We just have to hold on to the panic handles and hope that we are heading for a soft landing.

There is explicitly NO WARRANTY that the given settings are correct or harmless. (I only collect, I do not check for myself!!!). There is always the possibility that the settings may destroy your hardware! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Since I hope however that only well-minded people undergo the effort of posting their settings the chance of applicability exists. If you should agree or disagree with some setting, let me know immediately in order to update the list.  If you possess a HD not mentioned here of which you know BIOS and/or jumper settings, please mail them to me for the next update of the list!  Only IDE (AT-Bus) Harddisks will be accounted for. If not specified the Landing Zone should be set equal to the number of cylinders. If not specified the 'Write Precompensation' should be set 65535. (There are BIOSes that don't even ask for it).  Another statement (maybe right): IDE harddisk don't have Precomp and LZone. The precomp is a built-in parameter and lzone isn't used because most if not every IDE disk has autopark.  The jumpers' names are given as printed on the HD's board, often only a jumper number (JP12 means the jumper '12'). A zero means that the jumper is left open, a one means that the jumper is closed.    ***************************   C O N N E R   ***************************     Conner Peripherals Drive Geometry  IDE/AT  Conner drives are low level formatted at the factory.

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master.    In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives  when performing diagnostics.    There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way  interface connector. They have the following functions and are described  in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper  described nearest the 40 way interface connector.  LK2: LED       When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the      interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An      external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with      the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will      be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130      Ohms ot 220 Ohms.  LK1: Dual Drives      This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single      bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,      indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.  LK4: Master      When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If      there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be      jumpered in this way.  LK5: IOChRdy      When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is       fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher      data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per      second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally       fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per      second.     There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s) may be jumpered:       Master, single drive with LED on interface  LK2 & LK4 fitted.      Master, single drive without LED on interface LK4 only fitted.      Master, dual drive without LED on interface LK4 & LK1 fitted.      Slave, dual drive without LED on interface  No jumpers fitted.      Master, dual drive with LED on interface  LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.      Slave, dual drive with LED on interface  LK2 only fitted.     The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.     The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way  connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the  drive for this LED driver.

My question to you is, \\\"what grounds would you use to deny them access to  firearms?\\\"  Best I can tell this statement underscores your apparent total ignorance of the subject, and highlights your personal bias against firearms. I say this because there are only two possible paths of \\\"gun control\\\" which you could have been referencing.  Either: 1) You were talking about their access to semi-automatics firearms.  In this case I should point out that semi-automatic firearms are legal in most areas of this Country, including Texas and Colorado.  In addition the members of the \\\"cult\\\" have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the ability to purchase these weapons.  So under what grounds would you deny them these guns?  Their religion?  The fact they they live in a large group alone by themselves?  Because you consider them to be a cult?  Maybe I consider your Church to be a cult!  This line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of \\\"thought crimes.\\\"  You and Pat Robertson should really get along.  2) You were referring to the ALLEGED FULLY automatic weapons possessed by the \\\"cult.\\\"  Under current US law, FULLY automatic weapons have been covered by some of the strictest gun control laws in this Nation.  So if David Koresh illegally possessed them, he would have had to circumvent some of the strictest laws we have.  How will more laws help?  By the way, it has been reported that David Koresh possessed a Federal Firearms License which would have permitted  him to possess FULLY automatic weapons.  If true, the 85 people who perished Monday in the fire, died so that the Federal government could collect a couple hundred dollars in taxes on guns David Koresh didn't declare.

(1) Any verse that comes out substantially different in different trans- lations is almost certainly unclear in the original.   (2) It is very bad practice to \\\"shop\\\" for a translation that fits your own doctrinal positions.  Personally, I still like the RSV.  NRSV and NASV are also very good.  I have a strong preference for editions that do _not_ indent the beginning of each verse as if verses were paragraphs.

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers) =====================================================================  I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?  1. Free options  The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.  Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will  be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86  is listed below.   X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was  done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).  It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.  There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,  X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you  don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).  X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).  2. Commercial options       1) Metro Link  2213 W.

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?  3. What is XFree86?     XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with    X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and    other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:      1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,        selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require        an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of        1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by        default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield        up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.     2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default        operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now        equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately        20% faster than X386 1.2.     3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,        or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4        with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from        SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.     4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.        Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about        the ATI and Trident drivers.     5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's        code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).     6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is        compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the        contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.     7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font        renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary        distributions.     8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.     9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA        cards is now included.     The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2    (they were not in XFree86 1.1):      1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of        available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200         (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).     2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the        monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \\\"two        headed\\\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only        been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).     3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.     4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to        consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for        more information.)     5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some         versions of these devices were not previously compatible).     6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor        timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous        documentation and a lot of experimentation).     7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including        implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many         vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more         information).     8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has        been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of        0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks        line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.     9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig        configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative        and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new        options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1)         manual page for more information on the format of this file).         Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file        in the source distribution for full details.     Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the    current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.  4. What OSs are supported?      XFree86 supports:  SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2  SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC  SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2  Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1   BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active  BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.   Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,  but anyone should feel free to submit patches.  If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to  xfree86@physics.su.oz.au  5. What video hardware is supported?     At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:   Tseng ET4000  Tseng ET3000  Paradise PVGA1  Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of   the PVGA1, and use its driver)  Genoa GVGA  Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000  ATI 18800, 28800   All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,  with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in  256 color mode.   The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of  video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the  ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome  server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.   It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to  non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To  avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86  1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel  clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are  discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how  these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such  a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with  future XFree86 releases.   If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,  it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the  Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not  work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.  In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond  products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions  of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).  If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.   Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA  video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the  CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It  could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset  on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot  of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested  theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not  working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86  working fine on them.  6. What about accelerated boards?   At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards  like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available  in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).   An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact  <hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.   A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>  or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.  7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?   The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the  16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory  contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-  planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each  of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-  buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled  16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code  could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).  But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer  implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,  but nothing is yet available from the project.  8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?   Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run  X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.  The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending  on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).  To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will  be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable   lower bound.  9. Where can I get source for XFree86?   Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22  from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:   export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)   ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)   ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)  (For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)   Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information  on which files you need to get to build your distribution.  10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?   Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:   ftp.physics.su.oz.au  - SVR4 binaries    under /XFree86/SVR4   ftp.win.tue.nl   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   ferkel.ucsb.edu   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/SVR4/XFree86   stasi.bradley.edu  - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   blancmange.ma.utexas.edu - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/ISC   ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86   tsx-11.mit.edu   - Linux binaries    under /pub/linux/packages/X11   agate.berkeley.edu  - 386BSD binaries    under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86   ftp.cs.uwm.edu   - Mach binaries    under /i386   Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may  archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will  contain a README file that describes what files you need to take  from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were  made when building the distribution.  IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?  11. Installation directories   The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot  (/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include  files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.   This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified  via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is  nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed  alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.  12. Configuration files   The XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\\\"Xconfig\\\") on startup.  The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in  the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.  13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes   David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known  clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.  The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and  is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is  also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on  export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated  occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the  settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to  David for inclusion in the database.   If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file   with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.  It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use  this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information  to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.   NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and        is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot        clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from        your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The        server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.        You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your        Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up        starting the server in the future.  14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit   If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to  reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is  fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.  V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?   First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).  15. SVR4  Why won't my xterm run properly?   If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define  CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.  csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'   The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping  problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be  installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.  16. SVR3   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.  17. 386BSD   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.   Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey  <Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the  file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:       agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2  18. Linux   You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc  jump libraries installed.   Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.   If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to  run the server as \\\"X -pn\\\". The default startup configuration assumes  that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files  /usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the  -pn argument to X386.   Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major  number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not  owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit  console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but  startx won't.   When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with  a tty, for example \\\"xdm < /dev/console &\\\".   For more detailed information, please read the file README present  with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.  19. Mach   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.  VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?   This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is  fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.  Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.  VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?  20. BSD compatibility library   A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.  The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a  which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),  seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include  <X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro  definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are  linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these  functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a  21. ANSICCOPTIONS   This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the  ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite  the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see  something like   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of   ANSICCOPTIONS=\\\"-ansi\\\"   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:   ANSICCOPTIONS=  to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death  with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because  CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must  add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.  XFree86 Contact Information      Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86     Core Team.  At this time the Core Team consists of:   The original \\\"gang of four\\\":   David Dawes <dawes@physics.su.oz.au>   Glenn Lai <glenn@cs.utexas.edu>   Jim Tsillas <jtsilla@damon.ccs.northeastern.edu>   David Wexelblat <dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com>   Those supporting non-SYSV operating systems:   Robert Baron <Robert.Baron@ernst.mach.cs.cmu.edu> [Mach]   Rich Murphey <Rich@Rice.edu> [386BSD]   Orest Zborowski <obz@kodak.com> [Linux]      e-mail sent to <xfree86@physics.su.oz.au> will reach all of the core team.   --------------------------------------------------  Thanks to all the people who already sent me corrections or additions, especially David Wexelblat (one of the major contributors of updates).\",\" I've been saying that for at least 2 years now and even the A's conditioning guru told Jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help his back.Although I don't for one second believe Jose used steroids,his back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience because they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame(see Jeff Bregel ex 49er as a textbook example), and IMHO Jose is too big for his frame.    I can't imagine how to estimate bat speed, but its pretty obvious that Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit, likely due to his back.    I don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the A's, and had no problems with it then. It might be that pre-back problems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're cold, its a hitch.    The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable with for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses track of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was  clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because he's changed his stance so much.  I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting all the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw himself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco's famous batting practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged bad hitting habits.   \",\"Hello,  I am looking for carbon-doped rubber.

The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer (and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible).  This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.  SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).  There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult  time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).  Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to do so, whatever Mac you were using. (And I am pretty sure that the Select 300 is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [? correct me if I'm wrong?]).\",\"Hi,  I need xrn and xarchie for the HP's (9000/730, version 8 OS), either in the source form or, (preferably) in executable form.

I'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host via RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require about 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lots of people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be interfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it  would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use an 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then  transfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM needs to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes to/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS). Everything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for this application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART built-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.  Does anyone know a  company that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain  circuitry I can use?  Thanks in advance for the info.\",\" Of your spelling, eh?

When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear taillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replaced the entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This time I happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  The dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them to fix it.  (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same problem.)  I haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5 years, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  I'm going to try to take it back to get them to fix it again.  I'm real tempted to drill some vent and drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  This is getting very annoying.

When Jesus returns some people may miss Him ?  What version of the Bible do you read Mike ?  Jesus is God incarnate (in flesh) . Jesus said, 'I and the Father are one.'  Jesus was taken up to heaven after His 40 day post-resurrection stint and the angels who were there assured the apostles that Jesus would return the same way and that everyone will see the coming. That's why Jesus warned that many would come claiming to be Him but that we would know when Jesus actually returns.

Beginning with U.N. Security Council Resolution 713 of    September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively    addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security    Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all    unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There    have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages    in Bosnia have been bombed.      In response to these violations, the Security Council decided,    in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all    unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize    Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-   zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.     NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air    enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General    was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY    FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating    allies.      The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my    direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to    all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct    of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by    the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces    initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and    12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.     These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m.    e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for    combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.      NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air    patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early    Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally    operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the    Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching    the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted,    escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these    steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such    aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by    NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved                                     more                                              (OVER)                                     2      rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will    be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations    Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was    consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully    considered before the rules of engagement were approved.      It is not possible to predict at this time how long such    operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces    to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional    authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-   tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and    I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward    toward attainment of our goals in this region.

I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such \\\"storys\\\" about them. OK ? Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:    -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.          It has an hightech \\\"boiler\\\" but the rest is still verry verry           conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-          powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.          If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find          a chapter about the \\\"CARNOT-process\\\" which describes how to          get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason          for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an          temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one           side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water          again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the           energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to          let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \\\"cold\\\"          steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.          And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of          energy that carnot will give them.          The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !          The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,          because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in          AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent          radioactive pollution of the environment !              -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-          Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still          verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere          around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with          the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the          metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.          This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures          up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.      -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever          possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the          years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem          at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have          1.5 mRem.

Thanks \",\" Dear Tim:  You say that you were a \\\"catholic,\\\" but if you do not believe in the Christian God (I suppose that means the God of the Bible) and publicly state this,    you are in all probability not a Roman Catholic.  \\\"Public heretics, even those who err in good faith (material heretics), do not belong to the body of the Church\\\" (Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, 1960, Ludwig Ott, p. 311).  All is not lost, however, as you still might belong spiritually to the Church by your desire to belong to it.  As you said, only God can judge the condition of a man's soul.  About judgment, on the other hand, St. Paul  1 Cor 5:12) urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians.  Following the Apostle's teaching, I judge that you should reconsider    returning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  He is the God who lives.    Concerning what you were told about non-believers when you were a catholic, that is true.  As I have posted before, Vatican II (Lumen Gentium, II,    n. 16) teaches: \\\"Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Chruch, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and moved by grace, try in their actions to do His will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation.\\\"    Responding to your solicitation for opinions on the thinking processes of God, the best I can do is refer you to Scripture.  Scripture is one of the best sources for learning what can be known about God.

I have a IIsi that came with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.   First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for over two months.  The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of shorts or bad connections.  Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again, and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not damaged, and I can go back to the original setup.  Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this day.   In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal should be terminated at all the ends.  Let me know if you have any more questions.\",\"My BBB Autoline arbitration experience is over.   The outcome was decidedly mixed.  I won the battle but  lost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was  defective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below  market value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average  retail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but  the decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the  Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the  fact that if you have an automobile that does not  depreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive  to deal with you.  There is no way that the  manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and  sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded  a repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's  representative at the hearing tends to support this  point of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not  seem to take the proceeding very seriously.  I decided to take the repurchase, even though I am  getting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have  to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon  myself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on  the Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to  my elected representatives telling them how utterly  ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for  a \\\"use deduction\\\" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.   As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying  for my insurance.  Summary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton HD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992  this vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems  that required attention included the transmission,  heater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main  problem was the five speed manual transmission.  They  could not install a non-defective transmission in at  least four attempts.  So, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but  you are going to get screwed on the price, unless you  paid too much in the first place, or if your car  happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.\",\"   In SGI's distribution with their Indigo line (others as well, possibly), they include source code for a GL widget that fits on top of Motif, and one that's Xt based as well.

That's *your* *interpretation* of these texts.   2 Peter 1:20-21 But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter  of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.  The study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20. Apparantly it's not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you.  2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.  Galations 1:11-12 For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.  For I neither received it from man,  nor was I taught it, but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.  When I read these passages, it was not immediately clear to me what every phrase meant.  I had stop and think about the possible connotations of words, what the intent of the author may have been, wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the  same meaning: I had to interpret.  If you want to believe that your  are not interpreting Scripture as you read, there's probably nothing  I can say to change your mind.  But I think it's naive to think that  our culture, experiences, education, do not affect everything we read.   In college, I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation.  Go to any Christian bookstore, there are scores of books on interpreting and understanding Scripture.  If interpretation is unnecessary, there are  an awful lot of misguided Christians out there wasting a lot of time  and energy on it.\",\" This is an addition (posted with permission) to some tech. details of cliper.

Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages on Clipper.  The name of the encryption algorithm is \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  Martin Hellman had written                  and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part                 message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK                 producing                       E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}  To which I responded:          My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the         \\\"family key\\\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by         law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack being a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key for the family key SK.          The unit key, also called the \\\"chip key,\\\" is generated from the         serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks         derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.         Compute the 64-bit block                  R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]          (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with         two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.         (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that         they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are         concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and         the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.  The seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on a laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people so that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during an entire \\\"programming session\\\" to generate keys for a stream of serial numbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be thrown out if desired).  The serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed by padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding for each value).  The resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired up with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two escrow agencies.

Friendly greetings,   Germano Caronni\",\" I finished reading a very good book, \\\"The Will of God\\\", Weatherhead. This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the will of God.  Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts; intentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He (Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael Parkin above quite nicely.  Summarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, God's ultimate will is never to be defeated.  God's intentions may be interfered with, even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by circumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all humankind) will never be stopped.  Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of this process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God's intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and deviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3) Despite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in the Cross, as Jesus willingly (\\\"not my will, Lord, but yours\\\") died for the redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant, overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances.   It was not the intentional will of God.  It was the circumstancial will, thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will.    Right, intentional will.  (Just like the Jewish people  We know neither the time nor the place.

I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original announcement.)   For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems. Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev, Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.  I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use.  If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they are rapidly changing!

Ditto to you, Self Righteous One. Lay your derogatory tirade on thick, Steve.  Y'all can keep laughing and I'll keep feeling safe and secure.  \",\" I'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.  Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I actually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.  I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to invest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then I also passed my road test.  On May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a 4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb), I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late, skidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under a car and been killed.  Now this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff as I did.  So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until you're ready to use it.   While you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in DC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you save up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear, plus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure the machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up machine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration and licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.   I pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200 in Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be poor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo more expensive.   There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle magazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or recent models might be available.  You could probably look through past issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice instead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around and they were generally set up the way I wanted.  Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping, were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence cheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\",\"  Reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in the world.  Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of religion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a \\\"real\\\" story (that is, a bigger headline).  Let's back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the various targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the Septuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has obvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy. These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and to the Septuagint.  Now, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars: first, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are variant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to \\\"fixing\\\"/predating the various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of my knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and have little theological import.  The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There is also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the septuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the septuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error.  Again, though, the differences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the material, but so far this hasn't happened.  The DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the OT, unlike for the NT.\",\" Well said.    Okay, Del, so Michael was being unfair, but you are being unfair back.

Example:  The Appearances of Mary at Fatima, Portugal in 1917.   Among other things, she predicted the conversion of Russia to Atheism  (something that happened less than a year later w/ the Bolshevik  revolution).  She also predicted the second world war (that is, predicte predicted that it would occur during the papacy of a certain pope, who  was not the current one.  It happened just like she said.)   She warned there would be \\\"fire in the sky\\\" as a warning that the   second world war was about to start.  About a week before Germany  invaded, weathermen (and women, I suppose) all over Europe, from  England to Spain to Eastern Europe, reported the most spectacular  reddish color in the sky ever recorded.  To this day some try to   explain it off as the northern lights, and the relation to Mary's  prediction simply coincidence.  You all can decide for yourselves.   Mary predicted that the Atheistic Russia would spread her evils all  over the world and persecute religion.     She said many other things as well, too numerous to list here.

Snatches of the court's decision:  The Second Amendment was intended to \\\"assure the continuation and render  possible the effectiveness of such a force [the militia]... It must be  interpreted and applied with that end in view.\\\"  The militia includes \\\"all males physically capable of acting in concert  for the common defense.\\\"  However, regarding sawed-off shotguns, \\\"certainly it is not within  judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military  equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\\\"  \\\"Judicial notice\\\" is the term of art here -- it meant that no such evidence had been formally presented.  This is different from claiming that they had ruled that it wasn't.   I'm not talking about plain shotguns in war -- I'm talking about short- barrelled (\\\"sawed-off\\\") shotguns in war.  Compare Revolutionary War blunderbusses; luparas in the Spanish-American  War; and trench-cleaners in WW I.  They were also put to good use by US soldiers in WW II, not to mention being invaluable to \\\"tunnel rats\\\"  in Vietnam, but, of course, \\\"Miller\\\" took place in 1939.   Here is my quandary:  you seem to be arguing that certain types of  guns fall outside the scope of the Second.  This isn't a useful argument  unless you believe that some significant gun or class of gun belongs in that class.    I think we both agree that zip guns probably aren't protected.  Maybe  we also both agree that all the weapons that random state governments  have been banning or trying to ban because they have \\\"no sporting purpose\\\"  and \\\"no provate citizen would ever need these guns\\\" DO fall under the  protection of the Second.    So, given that damn near any gun of any practical utility is or has at  some time been used by the military, even if only for marksmanship  training purposes, I need to understand why you are intent on pressing  this point, arguing that that SOMETHING is not protected by the Second.   Often, what makes someone unpopular is what other people say about him. How much did any of us fear or abhor the Branch Davidians six months ago?

If there had been anything in the way, corners to negotiate, doors to open, or  any other obstacles to movement, I would have had a difficult time exiting the chamber.  And any concentration of tear gas is hazardous to individuals with respiratory problems, and the wearing of soft contact lenses in a tear gas  contaminated area is considered a REAL BAD IDEA.  So hoping the BD's would peaceably come strolling out the door after being gassed is a bit unrealistic.

Wayne Lyle  -- \",\"My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or something. I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target, then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to harm.  But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away, heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this moment is hazy.  I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not. So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!  Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.  What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?  I eagerly await comment.

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed to Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their plan !  (Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity since it was coined by Bnai Brith)  What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media, is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.  However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.  As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.  Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the Jews used to establish their state : Religion. \",\"Hello Brad!

Cypherpunk remailer source is at soda.berkeley.edu in the   /pub/cypherpunks directory.  It's written in PERL, and is   relatively easy to install (no administrative rights are required).   Karl Barrus  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> has more information and   modifications. Also, most remailer operators mentioned above are   amenable to discussing features, problems, and helping new sites   become operational. Address all points in the section   ``responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to   advertising your service.  You should be committed to the long-term   stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously.  _____ <4.8> What are references on privacy in email?

For more   information send email to crosslink@athena.mit.edu.   MISCELLANEOUS =============  _____ <5.1> What is ``digital cash''?    With digital encryption and authentication technologies, the   possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be   realized.  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks   (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may   be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and   anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an   economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum   (~Dec.1992).    An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus   <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the   cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to   elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:      ::     command: help          user@host    where `user@host' is your email address.      _____ <5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?    These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,   especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past   a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as   breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most   internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a   ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,   curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a   system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and   patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also   the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.     _____ <5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?    From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:    > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were   > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy   > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,   > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant   > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people   > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,   > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek   > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or   > their opinions.    See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.    See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary   in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.  _____ <5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?    Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the   techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication   but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself.    Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the   proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible   to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,   typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is   posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually   untraceable  communication can take place between sender and   receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic   realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where   individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual   users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An   anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman   (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to   <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following   commands in the subject line:      subscribe     unsubscribe     help  _____ <5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?    `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain   protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information   or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make   public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade   `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be   concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in   operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that   some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious   because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This   argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet   posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a   very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at   worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ   for alt.security.        Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic   Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First   International Symposium on National Security & National   Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:    > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep   > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's   > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If   > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there   > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I   > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into   > an environment where any information which is at all interesting   > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little   > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,   > but you may differ...  _____ <5.6> What are `identity daemons'?      RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to   query a remote user's login name after connection to a local   communication socket (a connection of this type is established   during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not   widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement   it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to   anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system   adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a   trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.  _____ <5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?     Remailing/Posting   -----------------      - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,     publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.   - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET     postings.   - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information     obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,     encrypted addresses, etc.)   - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and     remailer site chaining.      General   -------      - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy     shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the     general public and their governments.   - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies      by systems designers into     hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'     `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.   - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than     wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement     agencies.   - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government     agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to     strengthening and protecting it.   ISSUES ======  _____ <6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?    From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:    > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic   > media which connect us.  Computer-based communication media like   > electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis   > of new forms of community.  These communities without a single,   > fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an   > electronic frontier.   >    > While well-established legal principles and cultural norms give   > structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like   > newspapers, books, and telephones, the new digital media do not   > so easily fit into existing frameworks.  Conflicts come about as   > the law struggles to define its application in a context where   > fundamental notions of speech, property, and place take   > profoundly new forms. People sense both the promise and the   > threat inherent in new computer and communications technologies,   > even as they struggle to master or simply cope with them in the   > workplace and the home.   >    > The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been established to help   > civilize the electronic frontier; to make it truly useful and   > beneficial not just to a technical elite, but to everyone; and to   > do this in a way which is in keeping with our society's highest   > traditions of the free and open flow of information and   > communication.      EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor, founder of   Lotus software, and John Barlow, lyricist for the Grateful Dead   rock band.  A highly publicized endeavor of the organization   involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI   raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``Steve   Jackson Games'').  The foundation publishes EFF News (EFFector   Online) electronically, send requests to effnews-request@eff.org.      In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee   with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated   November 5, 1991,  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented   Mitchell Kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national   public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly   by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' (complete text in    ftp.eff.com:/pub/pub-infra/1991-12):    > ...we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to   > work with other sectors of the communications industry to create   > a consumer-oriented, public information network. Please let me or   > my staff know what policies you and others in the computer   > industry believe would best serve the public interest in creating   > a reasonably priced, widely available network in which   > competition is open and innovation rewarded.  I also want to   > learn what lessons from the computer industry over the past ten   > to fifteen years should apply to the current debate on   > structuring the information and communications networks of the   > future....I ask your help in gaining input from the computer   > industry so that the Subcommittee can shape policies that will   > bring this spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship to the   > information services industry.      ftp.eff.org   ===========      /pub/eff/about-eff   ---     A file of basic information about EFF including goals, mission,     achievements, and current projects.

The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility have been   working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues   since ~1982.  The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,   Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation   against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other   U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation   on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,   NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in   Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on   Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to   testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and   caller identification.    CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available   via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising   the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For   more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.     (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions   here.)  _____ <6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?    In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies   on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in   such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.      (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):    > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May   > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card   > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success.    > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying   > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of   > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some   > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department   > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide   > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of   > jurisdictions.    Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated   instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a   crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal   search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of   Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST   by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science   Fiction Magazine:    > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional   > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the   > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared   > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,   > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin   > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only   > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place.    > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that   > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document   > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.    FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed   on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier   Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe   Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:      > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret   > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal   > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a   > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,   > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment.    >    > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in   > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,   > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke   > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer   > seizure policies.  While the Service has seized dozens of   > computers since the crackdown began in 1990, this is the first   > case to challenge the practice.    >    > Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin   > science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never   > suspected of a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal   > research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and   > the suspected illegal activities of an employee, or to determine   > that the company was a publisher. Indeed, agents testified that   > they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the   > special Secret Service school on computer crime.    >    > \\\"How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what   > Steve Jackson Games did, what it was?\\\" asked Sparks. \\\"An hour?    >    > \\\"Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to   > Steve Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything   > taken?    >    > \\\"Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had   > a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen   > -- saying he was a computer crime suspect?    >    > \\\"Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material   > could harm Steve Jackson economically?\\\"    >    > Foley replied, \\\"No, sir,\\\" but the judge offered his own answer.    >    > \\\"You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go   > out and hire a lawyer and sue you.\\\"    >    > More than $200,000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier    > Foundation in bringing the case to trial. The EFF was founded by    > Mitchell Kapor amid a civil liberties movement sparked in large   > part by the Secret Service computer crime crackdown.      ftp.eff.org   ===========      /pub/cud/papers/sundevil   ---     A collection of information on Operation SunDevil by the Epic     nonprofit publishing project.

ISDN is a high-speed data communications standard that utilizes   existing copper telephone lines, and is a possible inexpensive and   intermediate alternative to laying fiber optic cable for phone   networks.  The speeds involved may be sufficient for audio and   video transmission applications.  G.

The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.  Joe Buehler  ...  Schism and Disobedience  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.  The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend \\\"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\\\"  It adds that \\\"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\\\"Not only does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \\\"We pray for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy.\\\"  ...  Intrinsically Schismatic?  The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response.  It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The first part deals with \\\"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church\\\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church.  But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" which is entitled \\\"Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise\\\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is Canon 1382, which reads: \\\"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the Holy See.\\\"  The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder.  I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church.  Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to      The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not     in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with     offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses     against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are     apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a     pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the     exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the     consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh     Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated     he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because     there was no intention of a breach with the Church.  ....  It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy, and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.  Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February 1989 Remnant merits careful study:\",\"*******************************************************                    1969 karmann ghia *******************************************************  This car is in excellent running condition:                *********   *49,000 mi on new engine   *new tires (Aug 92)   *new clutch (91)   *new carb (91)   *original radio (am/fm)   *upholstery in great shape   *burgundy exterior/ black interior  This car has been well-maintained with regular tune-ups.

Judaism did not father Islam.  We had many of the same prophets, but Judaism ignores prophets later prophets including Jesus Christ (who Christians and Muslims believe in) and Mohammed.  The idea of believing in one God should unite all peoples.  However, note that Christianity and Islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views and the rights of non-Christians and non-Muslims are stated in each religion.   We are supposed to pay 6% of our income after all necessities are paid.  Please note that this 6% is on a personal basis - if you are poor, there is no need to pay (quite the contrary, this money most often goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor Muslims around the world).  Also, this money is not required in the human sense (i.e. a Muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money and nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid (and we surely don't pass money baskets around during our prayer services)).  God's presence is certainly on Earth, but since God is everywhere, God may show signs of existence in other places as well.  We can not say for sure where God has shown signs of his existence and where he has not/.  The Qur'an is not a copyright of the Taurah.  Muslims believe that the Taurah, the Bible, and the Qur'an originally contained much the same message, thus the many similiarities.  However, the Taurah and the Bible have been 'translated' into other languages which has changed their meaning over time (a translation also reflects some of the personal views of the translator(s).  The Qur'an still exists in the same language that it was revealed in - Arabic.  Therefore, we know that mankind has not changed its meaning.  It is truly what was revealed to Mohammed at that time.  There are many scientific facts which were not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later such as the development of the baby in the mother's womb.   Only God knows for sure how it will turn out.  I hope it won't, but if that happens, it was the will of God.  Please send this mail to me again so I can read the rest of what you said.

Thanks. \",\"-*----  I think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross purposes. Above, Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre science that makes smaller steps.  In most of this thread, I have been concerned with the difference between what is science and what is not.   Lee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between Einstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of their thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts are scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or Korzybski as examples.  If you don't like these, choose your own.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong. Both Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to do this.    Let me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked to review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many kinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is that the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of criticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either not important or not interesting.  The first difference is the one that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the one that Lee Lady seems to be discussing.    I have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered  scientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims, not just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect that traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work; what it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the presence of qi.   Certainly a \\\"theoretical structure that makes sense\\\" is the goal. In areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with forming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Let's face it: we cannot always wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything clear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. \",\"[ ... ]  Then it also supports basing such regulations on ignorance.

No motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed, unless you call failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use \\\"slower\\\" RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow RAM (in which case, all memory will run at that slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash.  Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine it has faster RAM.    Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus  slowed down to accomodate slow RAM.

There is no planet inside of the orbit of Mercury.  The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to Newtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations and calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system of equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was afoot with Mercury.  But alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915 and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian  geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of it's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession of Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb's numbers rather than Leverrier's.)  Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequent efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar have been fruitless.  -Bill Gawne   \\\"Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe   are the laws of the universe.\\\"                       - G.

Otherwise, the key  management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system  unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place at the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in  their data base?  This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key  algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is  rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that  could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.     As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to ban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they  need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont  have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, they talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed.

I think Orthodox practice varies from place to place, from parish to parish and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some parishes here in South Africa the only ones who receive communion are infants (i.e. children under  7). In our parish it is expected that one will have been to Vespers and confessional prayers the evening before, and that one will have been fasting. As we have to travel 70km to the church, we don' t receive communion every Sunday, but about every third Sunday.  Steve\",\":My wife's ob-gyn has an ultrasound machine in her office.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years). I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling (and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury car.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924. I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car.   \\\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as the Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue to handle your account.   \\\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard [higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with a 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year, but cancel you after that.\\\"   \\\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually faster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\\\"    That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers - as very traditional and conservative.\\\"   I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure guy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft.      /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.   / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil ========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======           ======================================================================== 32   I live in Idaho.

The empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will show up to see the Bruins play the Sabre umpteen times than see the Bruins play the Captials in the first round.  Maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will no longer be the case.

Teel:   Well, the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the  Income Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for  stopping withholding, et cetera have been out there for a  while now.  Humbug.  Those letters don't provide \\\"concrete proof\\\" of anything at all in the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu- ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations.  Specifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that income tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have to pay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with- out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness).  This issue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect something squarely on point from the US Supreme Court (in the case of federal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax).  Unless you can do that, I for one am unwilling to call your material \\\"concrete proof\\\".   There has been no refutation to date.  Have the nay-sayers  finally given up as defeated?  Sure would like to hear their  reasons for disbelief at this point.  Refutation??  Refutation of what?  You haven't made a case yet.  You've posted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason to believe that any court in the US will agree with you.  Your claims seem on the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I feel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your arguments have any merit whatsoever.  And the cases you've cited involve such strange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are applicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal to the Supreme Court.  Why can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular employee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay his income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva- sion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court with a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally voluntary?  What, you say?  No such case exists?  Hmmm, I wonder why not; why haven't you?   Shall I conclude that the point has been received and the  opposition has forfeited the field?  With all due respect, you can conclude anything you want.  I just hope, for your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of authority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit- ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions.  For that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought you told us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big banking interests since the 1938 \\\"admiralty jurisdiction\\\" coverup thing. Do you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble to subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into their burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right combination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?  Not only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway? Didn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by US officials to classify you as a \\\"14th Amendment federal citizen\\\"?  When the FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell them they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington, D.C., where they belong?  Or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you suggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like. If you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just declare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads with no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet can just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with plenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).  Sorry, everyone, it's getting late, and I'm sick and tired of all this garbage.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.       WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE      Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     \\\"scooped\\\" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study, Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:         Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year    Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year    Shuttle sources:   725,000 kilograms/year      The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \\\"the bends\\\", certainly some     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,     you're dying. The limits are not really known.

HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED      The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin     team's medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team     examined them, they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE \\\"FACE ON MARS\\\"      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

If it is only used for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file encryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced standard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to easy-to-break inverters.  Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap. Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e-mail and files, let's focus on this.  One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.  Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal less threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no secure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a \\\"goat\\\" can eavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones.  -------  Reading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese security services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.  Most legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to have a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of depositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable escrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the week, and that system has worked pretty well.  From my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that need to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in return we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly skilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be checked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have to be, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries, while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.  ------  In discussing this, let's try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and noise of some previous threads. This is a substantive and technical issue, and personal remarks have no place in such a discussion. \",\"Mack posted:  \\\"I know nothing about statistics, but what significance does the relatively small population growth rate have where the sampling period is so small (at the end of 1371)?\\\"  This is not small.

Most people seem not able to, and that is why so many deny that this problem exists, for me most especially in the industrialised countries (low growth rates, but large environmental impact). Iran's high growth rate threatens things like accelerated desertification due to intensive agriculture, deforestation, and water table drop. Similar to what is going on in California (this year's rain won't save you in Stanford!). This is probably more to blame than  the current government's incompetence for dropping living standards in Iran.\",\" I, too, have a XC68882RC50 math coprocessor, which I installed succesfully in my Mega Midget Racer (clocked at 33 MHz).

Status: R  Redwood City, CA (API) -- A tense stand-off entered its third week today as authorities reported no progress in negotiations with charismatic cult leader Steve Jobs.  Negotiators are uncertain of the situation inside the compound, but some reports suggest that half of the hundreds of followers inside have been terminated.  Others claim to be staying of their own free will, but Jobs' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.  In conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting information on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the industry.  At times, he has claimed to \\\"have hardware which will blow anything else away\\\", while more recently he claims they have stopped manufacturing their own.  Agents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is equipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and possibly Canon equipment.  The siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to other cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations, including a young man who will identify himself only as \\\"Bill\\\" and claims to be the \\\"MS-iah\\\".  Former members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak hesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work 20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were frequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of \\\"interpersonal computing\\\" which rejects traditional roles.  Late-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on federal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares throughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own apocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers carry Jobs' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling \\\"I want to welcome you to the 'Next World' \\\".\",\" Not to drag this out anymore, but....  Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that in an endemic area, they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs presenting with lameness, swollen joints, +/- fever.  A recent paper (March 1993) has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting.  This has been an ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirements for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease. Up to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to \\\"prove\\\" that the disease exists.  This paper is noteworthy in two other regards:  1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogs had episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5 months after exposure.  After this period, none showed any further clinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  So these are proven, clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous recovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course, observations longer than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn't have the same chronicity that some see in humans.  2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course, they want the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine efficacy.  Anyway, maybe we will see some independent, scientifically sound evaluations of this vaccine in the next year or so. \",\"Notwithstanding all the legitimate fuss about this proposal, how much of a change is it?  ATT's last product in this area (a) was priced over $1000, as I suspect 'clipper' phones will be; (b) came to the customer  with the key automatically preregistered with government authorities. Thus, aside from attempting to further legitimize and solidify the fed's posture, Clipper seems to be \\\"more of the same\\\", rather than a new direction.    Yes, technology will eventually drive the cost down and thereby promote more widespread use- but at present, the man on the street is not going to purchase a $1000 crypto telephone, especially when the guy on the other end probably doesn't have one anyway.  Am I missing something?    The real question is what the gov will do in a year or two when air- tight voice privacy on a phone line is as close as your nearest pc.

Section 3.  This act is hereby declared to be an emergency measure necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety.  The reason for this necessity is that with immediate action, this act will prohibit the continued purchase, possession, and use of military weapons and as a result will ameliorate a substantial threat of death and injury to the public caused by the misuse of improper use of these weapons. Therefore, this act shall go into immediate effect.\",\" I don't want to get into a semantic argument, but contrary to some other postings \\\"near UV light\\\" /is/ \\\"actual UV light.\\\"  The \\\"near\\\" means that it is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength), not that it is \\\"nearly UV.\\\"  (I'm sure you can figure out now just what \\\"far UV\\\" is.)  Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the visible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.  It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to be useful, but not dangerously so.\",\"   A good summary has been posted (thanks), but I wanted to add another comment.

It works well and is very portable.       I haven't done any benchmarks against the others, but the code      looks clever & Lenstra is an accomplished number theorist.

However, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against muslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and open hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know that historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone by the death penalty.  My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the law of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy.  I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \\\"fasad\\\". This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.   I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book. However, the charge of \\\"fasad\\\" can encompass a number of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the \\\"crisis\\\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people, not books.  The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz, presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred.  Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this point that the fatwa on \\\"fasad\\\" was issued.  The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The crime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being played out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\",\" They require two separate grounds.

Peace Will  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \",\"04/19/1993 0000  Lezghis Astir  By NEJLA SAMMAKIA  Associated Press Writer     GUSSAR, Azerbaijan (AP) -- The 600,000 Lezghis of Azerbaijan and Russia have begun clamoring for their own state, threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner  of the Caucasus.  The region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and Ossetia, but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former Soviet Union to fight for independence.  Lezghis, who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about the conscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared war with Armenia.  They also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia, which were effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national borders that had been only lines on a map.  A rally of more than 3,000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription and demand a separate \\\"Lezghistan\\\" alarmed the Azerbaijani government.  Officials in Baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot six demonstrators to death. But the government announced strict security measures and began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of Lezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.  Visitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon after the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.  At the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a war they say is not theirs.  \\\"I have been drafted, but I won't go,\\\" said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth glinting in the sun. \\\"Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have nothing to do with Armenia.\\\"  More than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.  Malik Kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 locals drafted in 1992 had served.  \\\"The police don't force people to go,\\\" he said. \\\"They are afraid of an uprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan.\\\"  All the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but disagreed on how the protest came about.  Some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was about to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.  Others said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the Lezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan.  \\\"We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about draft orders,\\\" said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval.  \\\"We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis,  the Russians.\\\"  In the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties, in what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.  By 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they came under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the  600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.  About half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan.  \\\"We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine,\\\" complained Mais Talibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar, included brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan.  \\\"We want our own country,\\\" he said. \\\"We want to be able to move about easily. But Baku won't listen to us.\\\"  Physically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other Azerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same  jobs and intermarrying to some degree.  But the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and Persian with strong guttural vowels.  Azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest ethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary  school classes in their language.  Autonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from Azerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the  Talish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern Azerbaijan.    \",\"What is hardware handshaking and when do I want to use it?

Deputy Prime Minister Erdal Inonu told reporters in Ankara that Turkey was responding positively to a request from Azerbaijan for assistance.  \\\"We are giving a positive response to all requests\\\" from Azerbaijan, \\\"within the limits of our capabilities,\\\" he said.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Vural Valkan declined to elaborate on the nature of the aid being sent to Azerbaijan, but said they were within the framework  of the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  Hurriyet, published in Istanbul, said Turkey was sending light weapons to Azerbaijan, including rockets, rocket launchers and ammunition.  Ankara began sending the hardware after a visit to Turkey last week by a high-ranking Azerbaijani official. Turkey has however ruled out, for the second time in one week, that it would intervene militarily in Azerbaijan.  Wednesday, Inonu told reporters Ankara would not allow Azerbaijan to suffer defeat at the hands of the Armenians. \\\"We feel ourselves bound to help Azerbaijan, but I am not in a position right now to tell you what form (that) help may take in the future,\\\" he said.  He said Turkish aid to Azerbaijan was continuing, \\\"and the whole world knows about it.\\\"  Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel reiterated that Turkey would not get militarily involved in the conflict. Foreign policy decisions could not be  based on street-level excitement, he said.  There was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports, based on Armenian sources in Yerevan, saying Turkish pilots and other officers were captured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and  helicopters.  The newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the border with Armenia, but military sources denied reports based on claims by local people that gunfire was heard along the border. No military action has  occurred, the sources said.  The latest upsurge in fighting between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis flared early this month when Armenian forces seized the town of Kelbajar and later positioned themselves outside Fizuli, near the Iranian border.  \",\" There is something going on here.

It happened in La Salle, France.  The moral lesson of the story is:  The Lamb of God has been sacrificed and His blood has  been used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as God perceives worthy of being done in Heaven.  Mary weeps for The Lamb and for the rest of her offsprings.  This will continue while we  disobey God or sin against Him.  Mary, as a messenger,  has been given the task to make us be 'aware' of the evil serpent (communism, wars, famine, unfaithful, disobedience to God, etc.) running after the rest of her offsprings.    The children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is  brought back by her peace and loving messages, reparations for sins,  to obey God's commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence  of The Lamb.  As she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the Son of God in her womb, Mary has been preparing us, the Church, the Body of Christ, for His second coming (making sure we are  protected from the dragon).  Also, she has been preparing the new  Eden, by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve.  The new Eden will be the sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in His next coming.      I relate the story again:     I believe this and Mary, in one of her apparitions       in 19th or 20th century, she appeared to these           two children who tends goats and cows (I forgot          the exact place).  She was  weeping and telling the      children that she is afraid she's \\\"going to lose her     Son's arm\\\".  She is mourning too for these               townfolks because it was their fault that there          would be drought in their harvest; not much good         food again this year as it was last year.                                                                         Mary tells the children:                             *    Most of the townfolks in this place worked whole    * *    week even on Sundays when they should be in church  * *    honoring God.  These townfolks swears and           * *    uses her Son's name in bad words.  That is          *     why her Son's arm is so heavy in pain.                   Then she asked them if they pray.  The children          said \\\"hardly\\\".  She asked them to pray every             morning and night.  When the children went back          from work they had to tell somebody about this.          When the news was spred and after thorough           *    investigation of the incident, the townfolks        * *    were converted and faith and obedience to God       * *    were restored in their community.                   *   Once again, the Lamb succeeds.\",\"On Sat, 17 Apr 1993 20:42:58 GMT, Greg Hennessy observed: : #Tells you something about the fascist politics being practiced ....  : Ah, ending discrimination is now fascism.

It, like any process, gives erratic  results with variable inputs.\",\"Article #60579 (60704 is last): From: r0h7630@tamuts.tamu.edu (Rithea Hong) Subject: Re: Perfect MAG MX15F Monitors? Date: Sat Apr 17 07:13:05 1993  A friend of mine got a Mag of the above model and it had some distrotion, so he sent it back.  Unfortunately, the replacement also was distorted.  I would bet it's a common problem.  The best advice I've heard when buying monnitors is to actually look at the specific one you will buy (as opposed to model) since monitor manufacturing even from \\\"Big Names\\\" still tends to produce alot of monitors with visible defects.

How about this argument:  1)  Second Amendment gives us the right to keep and bear arms.  2)  Strong cryptography is \\\"arms\\\", according to the U.S. government (that's     why it's so hard to export).  Therefore, we have a constituitional right to strong cryptography!   Q.E.D.  However, it's likely to be as hard or harder to exercise this right as it is getting to exercise the other rights that the government is slowly restricting.  Maybe the NRA _would_ be the best existing organization? (Although I think a new one might be better, but perhaps would take too long to start up.  I would certainly join.)\",\"[...]  I presume that you meant to say tcsh here ------^^^^^  --   Michael Salmon  #include <standard.disclaimer> #include <witty.saying> #include <fancy.pseudo.graphics>\",\"com    On a DA revolver, you get another try on a misfire.  On a pistol where the trigger does not cock the hammer, like a Jennings, or an Astra M400, or a Glock, a misfire requires the slide be cycled to get the gun  to function.  Rather than a high capacity revolver, think of a Glock as an Astra M400  with no manual safety and a heavier trigger pull.\",\"  My whole point was not to say that the cars *couldn't* go that fast, but that they *shouldn't* go that fast.  A family sedan designed to be operable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because you added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much larger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the *brakes.*  The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power plant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications. I have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a brick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I personally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is inadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of the car is not up to par.  I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these cars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.  There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought it up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe the following to be true:  1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here. 2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than    they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them    far more predictable than most US highways. 3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have    speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in    the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not    much higher than 120km/h.  I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph (nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.  Some people have no respect for their own lives.    If you think so you sure don't pay attention to my

So a \\\"hourglass\\\" cursor should be shown when the application is busy, or a \\\"caution\\\" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in another. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level. So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain subpart of it, is a rather complicated matter. When cursors have been defined for some windows, e.g. a \\\"crosswire\\\" cursor for a DrawingArea, things get even more complicated. My intuition says that things should be easier, but is this so? If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem, please let me know. The topics on \\\"busy cursors\\\" in the several FAQ's are not helpful, since they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window attribute set to 'None'.\",\"We have recently obtained a Centris 610 and it has developed an unusual video problem.   Model: 610 with 8 MB/230 HD, 512K VRAM, no cards Monitor: Apple 16\\\"  When the computer is set for 256 colors and certain operations are done, particularly vertical scrolling through a window, horizontal white lines appear on the monitor (which generally but not always spare open windows).  These lines accummulate as the operation is continued.  If a window is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved away the line disappear from that area of the screen.  This problem is not observed if the monitor is configured for 16 colors or a 14 inch Apple monitor with 256 colors is used.   I suspect a bad video RAM chip but cannot be certain.

I am pretty sure this is happening because I am not using XtAppMainLoop, but am dealing with events via sockets.  (ya ya).

I cannot (or I don't think) call the XtNgetValue callback myself because I don't have the value for the third parameter of the get value proc (XtPointer call_data).

I can get the front wheel off the ground on my /5, ferchrissake!\",\" I agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400% does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus, before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is.   The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a player who gets an out gets a \\\"negative probability\\\" in most cases. Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes, they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also, the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given them a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.       No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score  in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The offence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.           No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look, if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers, fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \\\"negative chance\\\" that the team would win.   From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda. At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really does not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens. So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to player performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15% on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%. I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.  How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's, etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more valuble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better  pitcher?  They were probably about the same.\",\" : >: > Last year the US suffered almost 10,000 wrongful or accidental : >: > deaths by handguns alone (FBI statistics).

Please spread the word!  Here's some information about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have some money available...  John Spencer, 1993/04/21  Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21, (21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;       1993 May 1-2          A-ring ingress  18:27                egress   19:30         B-ring ingress  19:51                egress   21:42         C-ring egress   23:00         Saturn ingress  23:59                egress   10:02         B-ring ingress  10:28                egress   12:19         A-ring ingress  12:40                egress   13:43       1993 July 20-21          Saturn ingress  21:16                egress   05:08         A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)                egress   09:38  Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris, and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus' orbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from Iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my attention.  THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?     To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July   disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,   etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,   except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3   airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with   a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something   to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.    Jay  and again:    please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet   disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would   be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and   getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a   good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't   think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are   well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One   possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.  jay\",\"There are also a couple or three places on West 45th between Fifth and Sixth.

The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project.\",\" Rick Tocchet was captain of the Flyers for several years before he was traded to the Pens...                                      -John Santore   =============================================================================  ____________________                                 /                    \\\\                   \\\"We break the surface tension  \\\\_________     ____   \\\\                   with our wild kinetic dreams\\\" /             /    \\\\   \\\\                        -Rush, Grand Designs \\\\_______     /  (*) )   ) /           / /\\\\___/   /                 Go Philadelphia Flyers! \\\\_____     / /        / /         /  \\\\_______/                   John Santore (jsbh@andrew.cmu.edu) \\\\________/   \",\"Enclosed are the rules, guidelines and related information for the 10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest.

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers  X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with  X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor  X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X * look at the original source X * convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X * run it through a C beautifier X * examine the algorithm X * lint it X * compile it X * execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting \\\"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake\\\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X #define d define X #d foo     <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X int i; X j;     <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you  X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in  X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X int i; X char *c; X i[c];     <--- use c[i] instead X (i+3)[\\\"string\\\"];   <--- use \\\"string\\\"[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X * assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X * casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X * passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X * passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X * performing arithmetic on va_list variables X * using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X * are very hardware specific X * are very OS or Un*x version specific X      (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X       code is likely not to be) X * dump core or have compiler warnings X      (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X * won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X * abusing the build file to get around the size limit X * obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X * are longer than they need to be X * are similar to previous winners X * are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X * are as concise and small as they need to be X * do something at least quasi-interesting X * pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X * are portable X * are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X * MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X * make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X where this program differs from the contest rules, the X contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule: 1993 Xfix: n Xtitle: chonglab Xentry: 0 Xdate: Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost: Un*x v6, pdp11/45 X 2.9BSD, pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

If an entry wins, we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition, X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award, X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X * Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X * Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X  cc prog.c -o special_name  need special binary X X     or  rm -f special_src.c   need special source X  cp prog.c special_src.c X  cc special_src.c -o special_name X X     or  rm -f special_build   need special build X  tail +4 build > special_build X  sh < special_build X X * Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of  X   your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You  X   should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the  X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X     X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer  X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as  X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many  X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X date -u \\\"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\\\" X date -u | sed -e 's/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/' X sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X ---entry--- section X all ---author--- sections X all ---info--- sections X ---build--- section X ---program--- section X any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X * reading the ---entry--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X * passing the source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X * performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X * passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X * linting the source X * compiling/building the source X * running the program X * performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X * best small one line program X * best small program X * strangest/most creative source layout X * most useful obfuscated program X * best game that is obfuscated X * most creatively obfuscated program X * most deceptive C code X * best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X * best abuse of ANSI C X * worst abuse of the rules X * <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry  X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,  X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X     comp.lang.c    comp.unix.wizards alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X     comp.sources.d   alt.sources.d  misc.misc X     comp.sources.misc   comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners  X    have appeared in books (\\\"The New Hackers Dictionary\\\") and on T-Shirts. X X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-) X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X X    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.

It was a textbook in a class I had on comparative religion or some such thing.  It has some decent bibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading.  It doesn't \\\"compare\\\" religions directly but describes each one individually and notes a few similarities.  But nothing I have read in it could be even remotely described as preachy or Christian based.  In fact, Christianity mercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages.  The book is divided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began  (India, East Asia, Near East).  There is nothing about New World religions from the Aztecs, Mayas, Incas, etc.  Just the stuff people kill each other over nowadays.

I don't usually read t.r.m.  It is truly informative to stop by, and see that there are still people in the world like those that forced my ancestors into the deserts of Utah, and then out of the country entirely.  (My grandmother was born in Mexico, where her family had moved to escape religious persecution in the US).  I'm willing to admit that members of other churches are Christians, if they believe in Christ and (try to) follow his teachings, even though they have different interpretations of  the bible.  And yet these other churches often go out of their way to define whether or not I am considered to be Christian.  Could someone mail me a set of rules/beliefs that must be followed to be a Christian?  Does this set of rules exclude other large bodies of believers?    I know, this is a waste of everyone's time, this has probably been discussed N times, etc.  I guess I'm more sensitive to this 'demonization' after what went on in Texas.\",\" For me, it would be an obvious choice: Armed self-defence is clearly and strongly protected by the Colorado Constitution and the laws of the state. In the very clear-cut situation of your hypothetical, I wouldn't have anything to fear from the police (unless I had been publicly carrying the weapon concealed, something I'm not in the habit of doing... Even then, the worst I'd have to deal with  was a class 2 misdemeanor.) Even if the situation were not so clear, and I might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter or homicide, it would still be safer to wait for the police. If I were to leave and try to avoid police involvement, I'd be committing several felonies and ruining my chances of claiming self-defence in court (\\\"If it really was self-defence,\\\" the prosecuter would ask, \\\"why did you run away and hide from the police?\\\")  In other states, however, this decision might not be so clear-cut: If someone in, say, Washington D.C. were to use a gun in self-defence he would _automatically_ be guilty of several felony violations of that city's gun control laws. Such a person's choices would be between certain conviction for a couple of felonies versus possible conviction for half a dozen. \",\" How can a witness tell that someone in a burning truck is dead rather than unconscious?   What kind of witnesses?  If we are talking about witnesses who were at the accident, or were otherwise directly involved (e.g., paramedics, emergency room doctors, etc.), then they should have been used at the first trial.  You don't get a new trial because you screwed up and forgot to call all of your witnesses.  If we are talking about new expert witnesses who will offer new interpretations of the data, note that the loser can *ALWAYS* find such witnesses.  If this were grounds for a new trial, then the loser could *ALWAYS* get a new trial, and keep doing so until the loser becomes a winner (and then the other side would come up with new expert witnesses).\",\"If you want a summer without rain, you're in the wrong place. You must not have been here a whole year yet. Keep the Rain-X handy my friend.                Thatch\",\"   I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.    This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride    (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty,     fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).  Communication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler back every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled Magna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you  can't really communicate.  Balance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how they're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately and lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning thing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a pain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay perpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn and WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always screws up the line I've picked out.  Here's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:  - attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.  - Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not    get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount    in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)  - Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)  - We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many    first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)  - Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and    we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're    confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel    of it.  Or just hug me tight.    - Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be     gradual, so I can compensate.  - Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.  - Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right     thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how    to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to    stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to     watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84,     and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, \\\"SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED\\\"     I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with     the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.    Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the    instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her    experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to     trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)  Usually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes,  tires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers. Helps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.  Watch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little mudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will be nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones. It doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the  first trip!

Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.  I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?  Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost?  I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2?  Thanks for any comments on these rephrased questions.\",\"I'm considering the purchase of a 486DX-33 VLB system to run linux.

My response is then: you have given no reason for your statement that sex is not the business of religion (one of your \\\"arguments\\\").  The urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong measures are required to suppress it. If the urge to have sex is so strong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to find a marriage partner.  \",\" Then not murdering would have no moral significance, since there would be nothing voluntary about it.

The idea is that corn in the diet might    potentiate an already existing or latent seizure disorder, not cause it.    Check to see if the two Kellog cereals are corn based. I'd be interested.    --    David Ozonoff, MD, MPH   |Boston University School of Public Health    dozonoff@med-itvax1.bu.edu  |80 East Concord St., T3C    (617) 638-4620    |Boston, MA 02118    A couple of folks have suggested the \\\"corn connection\\\".  In the five month period between the two seizures, my daughter had eaten a fair amount of Kix and Berry Berry Kix in the mornings and never had a problem.  I checked the labels and the first ingredient is corn.  She has also never had a problem eating corn or corn on the cob but of course, that is usually later in the day with a full stomach so the absorption would not be so high.  I do believe that Frost Flakes have corn in them but I will have to check the Fruit Loops.  But the fact that she has eaten this other corny cereal in the morning makes me wonder.  Thanks for checking into this.  All information at this point is valuable to me.  Sharon\",\"  Can You report CRT and other register state in this mode ?

I guess all those social insects (e.g. ants, bees, etc.) which have one breeding queen and a whole passel of sterile workers are on the way out, huh?     I refer you to the bonobos, a species of primate as closeley related to humans as chimpanzees (that is, very closely). They have sex all the time, homosexual as well as heterosexual. When the group finds food, they have sex. Before the go to sleep at night, they have sex. After they escape from or fight off prdators, they have sex. Sex serves a very important social function above and beyond reproduction in this species. A species closely related to humans. There is some indication that sex performs a social function in humans, as well, but even if not, this shows that such a function is not *impossible*.

In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established  a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two  continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and  Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in  espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and  Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under  German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National  Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional  Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic,  Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often  expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary, during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]  \\\"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)  when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it   becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon  method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical  operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing.\\\"   Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews - extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.   \\\"...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities   against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the    murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian    neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish    and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see    the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...   Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise    to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would    help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of   the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

Anyway I saw the ads for the Diamond Viper (Local Bus, 2MB memory, 50 million+ WinMarks) and was wondering if anyone has had any experience with it (good/bad/not worth the money/etc.)  Any information at all would be nice.  Also, a few other questions.  Anyone know of a good cheap 15\\\"+ 1024x768 NI monitor?  And what is a good CD-ROM drive that meets MPC standards and is controlled via SCSI?  How about a 250MB tape drive on SCSI?\",\" I have owned my Sprint from the beginning and that sensor light comes on every 30K to let you know it's time for a check up.  When that light goes on, I just take it to the delaer tell them \\\"It's that time\\\" and they work on it for 4 hou and you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor) I currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for service, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the Oxygen sensor.  What the heck is an Oxygen sensor?  As far an I know of, I have never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten. Now, I don't have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have something to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor.  The only MAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced if you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and Gasket replaced.  And that was all done within the past 2 months.    What I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need to, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don't worry about the car for another 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor light bothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against the dash, there is a swith on the right side.  Flip that switch and the light will go off.  I do that so that little light won't annoy me.  If you can't find it, look it up in the car manuel.  I hope that I have helped a little and good luck with the _Oxygen sensor_?      - Thomas -\",\"    Are you trying to say that there were no massacres in Deir Yassin    or in Sabra and Shatila? If so then let me tell you some good jokes:     There is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in WWII     Palestinians just did what Davidians did for fourty years and more.     In fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place.     People die that is all. No one gets killed.

Well it is as stupid as what you said .Next time you want to lie do it    intelligently.     Sincerely yours.     Hassan  Arab civilians did die at Dir yassin. But there was no massacre. First of all, the village housed many *armed* troops. Secondly, the Irgun and Stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians. The village was attacked only for its military significance. In fact, a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before the attack was to begin.  By all rational standards, Dir Yassin was not a massacre. The killing was unintentional. The village housed Arab snipers and Arab troops. Thus it was attacked for its military significance. It was not attacked with intentions of killing any civilians.  To even compare Dir Yassin, in which some 120 or so Arabs died, to the Holocaust is absurd. The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians.

I'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to know what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an infinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that he/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?) Also, are we \\\"graded\\\" by those around us, or has there always been some unchanging method?  Is the person's childhood taken into account?  I'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you, but I figure that you're the experts.        -Quinn  [Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect that's because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However both Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of similar passages where Jesus says things like \\\"even XXX will be better off than you in the judgement.\\\"  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens, so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the Mormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition to the Bible and \\\"Holy Tradition\\\" of a more generic Christian sort.  Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free us from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you like test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale, but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading. Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to see why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are differences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all agree that in one way or another, God cheats.  I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't explicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their hearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in principle, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing line.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not.\",\" Of course you are a bunch of arrogant lawyers who know whats best for the  rest of us. You are doing such a wonderful job with our judicial system, getting all the criminals off, I bow to your superior intellect. Not to mention the fees you collect from us poor slobs who get tickets from  speeding State Police officers, so you can soak is when we go to court. I just love lawyer jokes! Don't you?\",\" Gee. Say they feed the 80-bit key through Snefru-8 and take the first 60 bits of the result, then use those 60 bits as the real key. How do you figure out that each key is one of 2^20 ``equal'' keys? You can try a birthday attack, but if the key can be changed only once a second then you will need several lifetimes to get reliable statistics.

Don't you know anything? \",\"   Yes, I do.      My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to   kill people.  That is it's primary (and I would argue only)   purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has   almost no utility, especially when you know you will be killing   innocents, is unconscionable.    At the very least, the existence of the prison system and our   transportation system are based on their merits to society, not   their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent   lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued   existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and   the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.    Just in case I wasn't clear again:  We maintain a capital   punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with   no net positive gain.  Why?    Were you to pin me in a corner and ask, I would have to respond   that I don't belief the state should have the right to take life   at all.  But I won't open that debate, as it seems others are   tiring of this thread on a.a anyway.   /\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\   Bob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM   They said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away, and sank Manhattan out at sea.\",\"         How about \\\"firearm related.\\\"          Texas is unusual in this regard.  It would be nice to reduce them both, though.         As Texas doesn't appear to have an murder rate that much higher than the national average, I would expect it is a result of a much higher suicide rate.          Be nice if you didn't have to suffer at all.          Here's where we run into a problem.  I am perfectly willing to have government regulation on something which is likely to cause others harm.  What we're discussing, though, is the extreme regulation of a large group in order to target a small group, and I don't think that's appropriate.            Does this, then, justify anything?  At some point you have to draw a line (at least to my way of thinking) where the government must have something a little more substantial than a set of percentages with which to punish an individual.          Where do *you* draw the line?  Or is there one?           Virginia.  It passed.           Does it?           Cute analogy.           The U.S. doesn't treat drunk driving like a serious crime.  However, we also don't confiscate cars of people who drink.  We also don't confiscate *all* cars because some people drink and drive.  It's the core of the legal system that in order to punish an individual (and I'd call property confiscation a punishment) you must have evidence against that individual. That is, it isn't enough to show that the majority of people convicted of murder are white  in order to convict a particular white guy of murder.

And since the camera wasn't invented yet we can only guess what  he looked like. For example, with all the dinosaur bones we're digging up we still don't know if they were yellow-polka-dotted, or purplish-orange 8-). Likewise, I don't think anybody has a  picture of Jesus (is there ? 8-) ) So our current image of  Jesus is our best guess.  Okay. So let's assume that Jesus is black. Would that make you follow His techings ? Cause if you follow His teachings, skin  color becomes a moot point, anyway. What counts more in your life ? Your faith in Jesus or His skin color (as a human) ?  In the interest of historical accuracy, however, since Jesus was from Israel wouldn't His skin color be like any other Jew ? i.e. fair-skinned ?

Sure -- only 3.8 years for each solution.     But there is a MUCH more pernicious problem with the scheme as proposed.  Building a brute force machine to test 2^40 possible keys if you have the other half from one escrow agent is EASY.  (One chip, one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks, and that break gives you all messages involving that phone.)     The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you nothing is an improvement, but notice that XORing with (truely random) bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents.  Using + for XOR, SK for the escrowed key, and A and B for two random bit strings, hand SK+A+B, SK+A, and SK+B to three escrow agents.  It is possible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern, for example 3 of 4, such that fewer cooperating escrow agents gives the cracking agency no benefit.  --       Robert I.

This week's MacWeek reports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August.  My guess is that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the price structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.  Your price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed for mine last month.  I would have rather waited for one of the new machines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of my IIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced me to purchase now.  I'm happy with the machine and won't feel betrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $1000 next week (heh).  Bottome line:  If the C650 does what you want, buy it.  If you wait until the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as well wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and then the units which follow them.  You may save some money but you've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the computer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuous state of flux.

Mostly, that means water turning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would  also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.  As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in a dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private ownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe condition. If any random private citizen could not properly keep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation is clearly appropriate.    I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community. If you look at the American  revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves from, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They didn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for  example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same old regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and destroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate. But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited for that.  There is also the question of personal and collective arms: The Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers other arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example) a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively) should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a  disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower. The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely democratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only 50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would be proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular will were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the form of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's firepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not of the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite different from the general public (at the very least, they would be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and character of the militia requires that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal weapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.\",\"  Ahhh, of course. Israeli morality pales in the face of charming events  like the string of PLO-run skyjackings in the mid 80's (remember those  TWA jokes?), and not to forget the Achille Lauro and however many airline bombings they have committed, not to mention bombings on the streets of  Israel (It's gotten to a point where children are told not to go near any bags or containers whose origins they don't know, because they could be  bombs), or last weeks Katyusha rocket attack on Northern Israel by Fatah, those wonderful \\\"mainstream moderates\\\" with whom Israel is attempting to negotiate.

Background of the problem:  I have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain, i.e  the mesh is a   mapping of a 3d Bezier patch into 2d. The area in this domain  which is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered. The trimming  loop is a set of 2d Bezier curve segments.  For the sake of notation: the mesh is made up of cells.   My problem is this :  The trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller  cells bounded by the trimming curve segments. If a cell  is wholly inside the area...then it is output as a whole ,  else it is trivially rejected.    Does any body know how thiss can be done, or is there any algo.   somewhere for doing this.

I would go further, and say that much of the damage to the environment has been caused by the secular worldview, or by the humanist worldview, and especially by the secular humanist worldview.  This is not to say that ALL secular humanists are necessarily avid destroyers of the environment, and I am sure that there are many who are concerned about the environment. But at the time of the Renaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre, or the focus of culture (hence \\\"humanism\\\"). This consciousness was also secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the present age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the same time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy. This doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it began to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European society and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later stages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that justified  them.  There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of \\\"economics\\\" - from the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces and powers. There were denominational differences among the new worshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was \\\"the free rein of the market mechanism\\\", while for others it was \\\"the dialectical forces of history\\\". But in both the capitalist West and the socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of Mammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to oppose what was happening and state their case.

[*]  Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded for a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slope of 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).  I've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried this before, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:  1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a packed->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the \\\"jaggies.\\\"  I'm now considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary). Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed, thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?  2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort the original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed. Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape?  Currently I take:    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32  33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48  49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64  and produce:                           1  2  3  4 33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8 49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12             53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16                         57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32                                     61 62 63 64  Line 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1. Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3. This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But it causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way? Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed?  Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective? I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering. Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.  [*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1) *are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to be an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points. This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have to change size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that this approximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing.  Hopefully the \\\"context\\\" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches hanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.

That is, we  observe in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced  by a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be  its own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.  God, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject  to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being,  God's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence  of a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the  supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused  phenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the  supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very  nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.  This is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted  to clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the  natural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being  interchangeable.\",\"  Actually I don't think there is any conflict if we really understand what these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the  meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will come to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere  belief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your  belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this  is what James means when he says that \\\"faith without works is dead\\\"  and, \\\"I will show you my faith by my works.\\\"  Remember James was  writing to \\\"the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.\\\"  This  probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much  later and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek. (Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he intended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the people of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of the Greek.  Another key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul's statements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the gospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great burden of Paul's life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go convert a bunch of people, then the \\\"Judizers\\\" would come along and try to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf Acts chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being saved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood of Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation for today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think \\\"faithfulness\\\" today has a meaning closer to what the original writers intended.   I think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is that God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not \\\"keep kosher\\\" to a kosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters of following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.   In the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and  be lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are  worse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in the parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in the one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that the price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.  [I agree with you in general, including the fact that \\\"pistis\\\" has some of the force of \\\"faithful\\\".  However if you take that too far, you can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have intended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we are saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that's not what you meant.  I have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that completely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I'd call a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and commitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic change.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show the new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any Christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that Jesus calls being born again.\",\" Ok if you are so right, name a few good examples that were brought up.   john\",\"   How about some numbers here?

I can't remember the exact details, but the stadium would be build practically downtown.  There is a small lot that could be used, according to the paper.  The 30th street plan has run into some trouble, because Amtrak does not want to reroute some of its lines in order to accomodate the stadium.  I don't have an opinion just yet, just letting everyone know that there are really two options being discussed right now.

MILITECH(tm) is yet another oil additive. But the demonstration of this product really impressive, if it didn't cheat.  The setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is half submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor is powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction.  The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.  Before MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft of torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was  added to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of torque.   Here is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink,  you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.  They say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz bottle is $25.  I still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was so little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn't believe it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle against my common sense.  Has anyone heard of or actually used this product? Is it real? If you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the  second floor. See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not.\",\" Hi...   THe best sound conversion program I've ever seen is SoundTool, which is shareware from Germany.  I found a copy somewhere in wuarchive.wustl.edu a long time ago, but I don't know offhand what directory it was under.  It's GREAT at converting files of all types, including Mac, NExT, Sun, and various PC formats... It's also a great player and editor, with various special effects that put Windows' Sound Recorder to shame.  It requires a driver for various sound cards... The only builtin one is for the pc speaker (and even that sounds pretty good), but if you're just using it to convert things, you can convert them in SoundTool and then play them in Sound Recorder.

For the moment we are only working on MAC and DOS/Windows. The department has    always used sneaker net to transport files to the MAC, since it requires a       filter to strip out the <LF> characters.

A.Lizard \",\" As usual, you are missing the whole point, Russell, because you are not willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith, which is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes.    This is like saying that the most important aspect of business management is accurate bookkeeping.    If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, it would be a poor thing indeed.  What was the methodology of Darwin?  What was the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, the methodology of Jenner and Pasteur?       First of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because I don't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science, homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should be accepted as science.  I, in particular, think the basic ideas of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.    What some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things (including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific attention.    If in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is effective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For all of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose methodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.    It is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on  those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous  fashion by those qualified to do so credibly.    But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as doctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in reason.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"    The \\\"System\\\" refered to a \\\"moral system\\\".

Many Russians became disillusioned with democracy and reforms when they felt, rightly IMO, that the West didn't care.  Yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid (once Bush got over his Gorby-mania.)  This probably kept him from dismantling the congress and calling for new elections.  Well, the aid didn't come through and we didn't make sure it went to the proper places and now the anti-reformers are gaining strength where before they were in hiding.   If they don't reform I don't believe in giving them money.  However, I think this is too important to take a non-interventionist approach. This is what really bugs me about Libertarianism -- it sounds like 'it'll all be the same in a hundred years time.  no need to do anything.'  Despite the wishes of Libertarians, this society is a far way, and getting farther, from being Libertarian.  Perhaps voluntary gifts would work if we had the proper framework but we do not have it.  We have to face the problem *now*, not in X years when we have a Libertarian dream society.  Right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade, let alone charity. There are still limitations to high-tech exports.  NASA can't buy Proton launch vehicles from them.  Sure, the market may be able to help a great deal but it can't right now.  There are too many obstacles. Instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to  tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face.  Well, I think limited government is primarily democratic due to it being limited.  But the main question is how do you transform a state-run economy and monolithic government into something that even remotely looks like ours?  (BTW, sometimes it seems that our government  is trying to go the opposite direction)  It is not going to be painless and not going to be easy.  We simply cannot wait to help when they *have* the 'proper' government.  They'll never get there without the aid.  It may be too late already.   And I'm just excercising mine.   As I also said above, another problem I have is with *transformation*. A Libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight. I have seen nothing about how to take our current government and society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible self-sufficient populace.     They didn't have nuclear weapons 100 years ago.  Nor instantaneous communications nor travel to virtually anyplace on the earth in less than a day.   Yes, depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses.  Rulers do emerge *somewhere* and they will never represent the opinions of every person on the planet.    There must be checks and balances.  Checks on the government when it gets out of bounds and checks on industry when it gets out of bounds.  Putting all your hopes on the benevolence of the market is, to me, just like putting all your hopes on the benevolence of government.  \",\"This is an all-point team for the Canadian NHLers who are not playoff bound...

Since it's rare to have a second parallel port in a PC, it's usually a good safe choice if you need an interrupt.  On the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here at work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1, a Mouse on COM2, and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which normally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight with a board when trying to use IRQ5, and discoverd the problem was that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon as we disabled COM3, our problems went away.

These aren't, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. That term denotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. The rockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, to distinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-made ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines with graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A \\\"D\\\" engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse. An \\\"F\\\" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to a doubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size \\\"O\\\" are available pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above are shipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines of size F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not as controlled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocket engines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)  There is an HPR Society, The Tripoli Rocket Society, I believe, which holds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities (FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association of Rocketry is more concerned with engines below H, though it is involved in HPR as well. These societies certify users of HPR rockets, and companies will not sell to uncertified individuals.  Bottom Line: It's legit.

This is simply an ad hominum attack and you know it.   Of course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen any organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate costs, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support a program and \\\"wrap\\\" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you say is not true.

Nasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some numbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then howl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.   Integration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was  done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of Reston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There is no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project that it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for  Apollo?   Oh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big. They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it replaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your bias goes.

Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it.    I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful large scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.  There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of leadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see this.   No, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have  happened in the first place.

Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes she had, however, is  the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians are attacking Azeri  towns.  Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  going to cause incessant skirmishes.  Think of 10 or 20 years down the  line -- both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe the other out.  These people will be neighbors, would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal?  If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of their blood and future.  It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.

I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have some of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.  The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons). For example, in the letter \\\"O\\\" there are two outlines:   1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)  2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.  One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply  connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \\\"polygon with holes\\\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.  I do not want to use this simplistic system since:   1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple   matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for   some fancy fonts).  2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.  From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as is done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.  My question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons.  Another question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create bevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these subjects but I can't tell which method is the best to implement.  Thanks for any pointers.  --> Rob Lansdale \",\"ddavis@cass.ma02.bull.com (Dave Davis)    II. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because    they are not quoted by the NT authors.  That is not quite accurate.  Otherwise we would have the book of Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the  apocrypha are not quoted by Christ.     III. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because    they teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted)    parts of the canon.     then I answer:     These is a logically invalid *a priori*.     Besides, we are talking about OT texts-     which in many parts are superceded by the NT    (in the Xtian view). Would not this same    principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_?    This principle cannot be consistently applied.   I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one voice, and he does not contradict himself.    The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example, the Lutheran hymn \\\"Now Thank We All Our God\\\" quotes a passage from this book.  The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's history.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the Spirit in so doing.

My brother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad (although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due to other problems with the relationship).  Anyway, the best thing to do would be to get everyone in the same room together (optimally in a room with nothing breakable), lock the door behind you, throw the key out underneath the door (just as far as the longest hand can reach.  You would like to get out after the conclusion, I would imagine), and hash things out.  More than likely, there will be screaming, crying, and possibly hitting (unless of course someone decided to bring some rope to tie people down).  Some of the best strategies in keeping things calmer would include:    have each individual own their own statements (ie, I feel that this relationship is hurting everyone involved because.... or I really don't understand where you're coming from.)    reinforce statements by paraphrasing, etc. (ie, So you think that we did this because of...?  Well, let me just say that the reason for this was ....)    don't accuse each other (It was your fault that ... happened!)    find a common ground about SOMETHING (Lampshades really are decorational and functional at the same time.)

It would not    be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be    local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill    AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.    High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but    the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun    - and would pay through the nose for it.  Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude, homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of killing German soldiers for their guns.  Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible. The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel tubing, hand tools and a welder.  I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown locally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I think the demand for \\\"real\\\" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have firearms, and \\\"bad guys\\\" will continue to have access to them, one way or another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation.\",\"I told some friends of mine two weeks ago that Koresh was dead.  The FBI and the BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their stupidity and lies.      Now before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as  a bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.  They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet,  whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into town on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and  wondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers. First, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they didn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got it.  After the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were coming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that. Well, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.  Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to them they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised Koresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                   The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he  \\\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out. His grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise David Koresh.\\\"  Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a logical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.  Here's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must be done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?  I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how much money this was costing.  That was the start of the \\\"Justification\\\" part part of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.  But, back to the plan.  It is considered \\\"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\\\" to execute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.  They knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not sure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the  compound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.  I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR (Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were subjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical  agent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.  I have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of thing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.  We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these people 51 days.    I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole thing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks changed my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:  \\\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\\\"  It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.  One more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic weapons on the premises.

Someone had to protect them. If not us who??  Compromise on what, the invasion of Cyprus, the involment of Turkey in Greek politics, the refusal of Turkey to accept 12 miles of territorial waters as stated by international law, the properties of the Greeks of  Konstantinople, the ownership of the islands in the Greek lake,sorry, Aegean.  There are some things on which there can not be a compromise.    Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment directly or indirecly is a \\\"bad\\\" person. It is not your nationality that makes you bad, it is your support of the actions of your goverment that make you \\\"bad\\\". People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you are. You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and as a such you must pay the price.   You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks. Just talk to Greeks, Arabs, Slavs, Kurds and all other people who had the luck to be under Turkish occupation. They will talk to you about murders,rapes,distruction.  You do not learn about Turks from history books, you learn about them from people who experienced first hand Turkish friendliness.\",\" XGA or XGA-2?

I broke the second rule of humor\\\" Copeland\",\"THE DIVINE MASTERS                              Most Christians would agree, and correctly so, that            Jesus Christ was a Divine Master, and a projection of God            into the physical world, God Incarnate.                            But there are some very important related facts that            Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of            most other world religions.                             First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-           STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master            (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES,            a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and            after the life of Jesus.                      The followers of some of these Masters founded the            world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of            their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added            THREATS of \\\"ETERNAL DAMNATION\\\" in Hell, and DELETED the            teaching of REincarnation.                         Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular            Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is            NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively            few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY            alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE            UNIVERSES.)                                              Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and            pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from            their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed            themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly            MANUFACTURED by the Romans.                        And emotional \\\"feelings\\\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING            indicator for religious validity.                      These things are similarly true for followers of most            other major world religions, including Islam.                       Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune            His Initiates into the \\\"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\\\" or \\\"SOUND            CURRENT\\\", (referred to as \\\"THE WORD\\\" in John 1:1-5, and as            \\\"The River of Life\\\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally            guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they            are still connected to their living physical bodies by a            \\\"silver cord\\\".                      True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of            REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved            only by reaching at least the \\\"SOUL PLANE\\\", which is five            levels or universes above the physical universe, and this            canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine            Master.                      One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri            Harold Klemp, the Living \\\"Eck\\\" Master or \\\"Mahanta\\\" for the            \\\"Eckankar\\\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis,            (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427).                      Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now            living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \\\"Sant            Mat\\\" organization.                        One of the classic books on this subject is \\\"THE PATH OF            THE MASTERS\\\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA             90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian            and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India            studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of            that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji.                      Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored            by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in            most public and university libraries and some book stores, or            obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \\\"ECKANKAR--THE            KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\\\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER            classic.                      Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with            the \\\"Anti-Christ\\\", which is or was to be a temporary world            dictator during the so-called \\\"last days\\\".  But the Masters            don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as            Jesus was.                      People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or            other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will            CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the            Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they            finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine            Master.                                 RE-INCARNATION                           The book \\\"HERE AND HEREAFTER\\\", by Ruth Montgomery,            describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation            as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past            lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes            makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist],            SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of            whom can identify their most recent previous relatives,            homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-           ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-           ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-           ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS            FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the            Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How            can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED            BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \\\"KING JAMES VERSION\\\".  Later            versions are PER-VERSIONS! ]                            Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc.,            typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example,            a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually            results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.             And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to            another person being met for the first time in THIS life,            because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS            INCARNATION.                  The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF            KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would            behave much better toward each other if they knew that their            actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the            future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION!               \\\"2nd COMINGS\\\"                 If a Divine Master physically dies (\\\"translates\\\")            before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that            Initiate physically dies (\\\"translates\\\"), the Master will meet            him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul            Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd            Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that            happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still            waiting for Jesus' \\\"2nd Coming\\\" are WAITING IN VAIN.                                       PLANES OF EXISTENCE                 The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN            major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the            Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric            Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane),            the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The            Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from            the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the            Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes.                      It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological            influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See            the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without            an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between            the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane.                      The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a            sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \\\"Hades\\\", and the            Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there            LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some            kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a            THREATENING manner.  The Christian \\\"Heaven\\\" is located            elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there            for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth.                                             SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH                 The Christian religion demands of its followers an            extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more            than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING).                         If a person is not HEARING some form of the \\\"SOUND            CURRENT\\\" (\\\"THE WORD\\\", \\\"THE BANI\\\", \\\"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\\\"),            then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL            CONTINUE.                      The \\\"SOUND CURRENT\\\" manifests differently for different            Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on            the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a            flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar,            Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as            a Member.  This and other experiences (such as \\\"SOUL TRAVEL\\\")            REPLACE blind faith.

UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this            IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED.  \",\" There is no known writing directly attributable to Menachem Begin which admits a massacre at Deir Yassin.  Thus, Hasan is wrong.   The word \\\"troops\\\" is unjustified.  There has never been any evidence that there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the village apart from the villagers defending themselves.  According to the Haganah observer Pa'il, the Irgun/Lehi forces suffered a lot of casualties because they were incompetent soldiers.  When they ran into trouble securing the central part of the village, a small group  of Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty. Begin's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of the major inaccuracies (to use a kind word) in his account.  Incidentally, \\\"three times as heavy\\\" may be correct, as there is serious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives than to the oft-quoted 250 lives.  However, note that Begin compares wounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number of wounded Arabs.  Guess why.   As is thoroughly established by many sources, the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a usueful warning.   It is worth noting how Begin disputes the standard myth that the Palestinian Arabs fled as part of a calculated plan.   Apparently 90% of Israeli historians are Jew-haters.   I have previously posted quotations by Irgun participants that totally destroys Begin's whitewash.  I have no particular desire to post it yet again.\",\" Mr. Ward, before you start blathering about your skill \\\"interpreting\\\" the Constitution, it might be helpful to learn to read.

As per request of Hasan:  From _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977:  [pp. 225-227]      \\\"Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to the story of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicized throughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women, children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the slopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable casualties.      \\\"The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].      \\\"In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr. Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of 'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'      \\\"The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel. Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting. Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the conquest of Haifa.\\\"   [1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) \\\"To counteract the loss of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the forces of Israel.

I'm new to these groups and so please forgive me if my questions are frequently asked, but I don't know the answer :) I've been recently having some problems with my 386 computer with a Seagate 40 meg hard drive. I occasionally find corrupted files, but most of the time programs work fine. Are there any utilities that are easily available that can help me determine whether or not the problem is a result of the hard drive vs an ill-behaved program or some other hardware item? Are there utilites to determine whether or not the hard drive is properly aligned etc? As might be expected, I would greatly appreciate any help on this matter.

The people of  Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never  abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally  hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole  perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July  15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop  Makarios.  Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with  the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right  given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently  and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For  those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island  since 1571.   The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct.               THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM  2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus  It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum.  AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS  The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed...  The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.  Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event.  \\\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying, in  Greek, \\\"You want Taksim eh!\\\"  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.  When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered.  In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying \\\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\\\"  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed.  An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded.  We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.  There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter.  After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport.  All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me.\\\"  ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER  We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days.  We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights.  In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner.  In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother.  In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head.  This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.  Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.  In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16  wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.    DAILY TELEGRAPH (London)    GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE   Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the  Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found  crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were  brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three   more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could  not be removed.

There are other animals on this planet with advanced  mental facilities which have not developed \\\"religion\\\" as a  satisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?   Further, it appears that only humans have a \\\"need\\\" to explain the  unexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,  including those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly  content in their ignorance.   I'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me  from your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal  *only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need  not be researched; 3) religion was \\\"made up\\\" by humans to address a  perceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that  is, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical  structure with biology at the apex).   Needless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the  underlying presuppositions.    I disagree that Christianity is \\\"an infectious cult\\\".  It has  certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in  spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.  That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is  \\\"infectious\\\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides  a workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this  is the case).   I disagree that Christianity is \\\"a safety blanket\\\" which supplants  hope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one  Source of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a  Christian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to  you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose  and externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of  control over one's own life the problem or is it something else?   Finally, one does not appropriate \\\"eternal happiness\\\" by following  Christian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance  of Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people  from their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the  Christian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian  in the Person of God's Spirit.   Heaven is one of two final states that  Christian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally  not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this  promised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived  benefits to them in the here-and-now.    Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a  priority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this  as a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate  priority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,  convert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).  Rather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting  the opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits  of a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful  that it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask  \\\"Why?\\\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-  plished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it  does not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian  is required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of  friendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot  evaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or  harm others if the sole purpose of being a \\\"friend\\\" is to gain a  conversion).   As a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-  ticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \\\"hurry-up\\\"  attitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no  conversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was  coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open  to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).  The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings  conviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part  (witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.    We are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die  just as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more  than this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is  so limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find  a more expansive view.   (For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing  arts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language  of other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?  How is it that humans can organize themselves in various social  structures whereas other animals have only one structure?)    Blatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.  Christianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not  a *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship  with a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-  knit relationship with this appelation.    There are \\\"Jesus freaks\\\" who let the emotional aspects of worship  and Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,  this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these  things flow.    Guilty by association?  That \\\"christianity\\\" which forces itself  upon another is not Christianity at all.    You appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened  2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?   I cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus' influence was a sole  result of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years  gone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert  that nothing about Jesus' life was noteworthy _until_ the sack.    Christianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself.

The behavior of believers is a completely separate question from that of God's existence; there is nothing contradictory here.  To say that something defined contadictorily cannot exist, is really asking too much; you would have existence depend on grammar. All you can really say is that something is poorly defined, but that in itself is insufficient to decide anything (other than confusion of course).

The hard evidence for my statements about his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book \\\"Orientalism\\\" by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian, not a Muslim.   Regarding Bernard Lewis:  Him being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his giving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.  Read \\\"Orientalism\\\" by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.  In fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).   I haven't read Lewis's article, so I can't comment directly upon it, and have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his political motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic polemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half-truths.  Again, read \\\"Orientalism\\\" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take what I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get this book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for _yourself_.   If slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some Muslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too.   I understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_.  Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.  Regarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject, showing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a very good one, under the title \\\"Islam and Women\\\", reposted from soc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site, then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this excellent article.    IMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.  Regarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made, which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based completely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view.  Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an and hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform a particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is part of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of course not.  Let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for you.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \\\"I am a Muslim\\\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean that Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and only an idiot would think so.  Do you see my point?   You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings. To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking -- Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of  capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)   One can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is because Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.  Selim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that Islam => lack of education and power.  For a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a significant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in the sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is completely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history shows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be other reasons for this situation.   Well, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are following the Qur'an or not.   The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \\\"following the Qur'an\\\" that Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis that is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory.    You have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it. So far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is quite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this.   I think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.   Here too.   Selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate ignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I think).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!  Selim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have.\",\"     I had the same problem.

A max of 65K    colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB    VRAM.  2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:     a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an       Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often       remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to       be.     b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the       display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you       shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).  3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development    Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger    icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the    debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed    to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The    Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.     Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen    is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter    \\\"R\\\".

Good and evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.  The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's rebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of the Scriptures.  Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words of St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, this is called \\\"theosis,\\\" or \\\"deification.\\\"  One can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul, and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the Creator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God, their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in their lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.  The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil, its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.  Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining of self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?  God must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There is no other way to achieve union with God.  Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities. He was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites, and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God, not in His essence, but in His energies.  The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25.\",\"I need to write an application which does annotation notes on existing documents.

He said something along the lines of \\\"I will be in you and you will be in me.\\\"  (Again I cannot provide the exact quote or citation.)  Anyway, my understanding of this is that the Second Coming will not be an outward event.  It is an inward event, Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him. If you look for a person you will be deceived.  It seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that would be a political or military leader and so didn't recognize Jesus when he came.  Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth. A lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems to based on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking over the world and running it the way it should be.  It sounds a lot like what the Jews were looking for.  The First Coming wasn't like that and I see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either.  Oh and by the way, I don't expect it to happen once.  There is no one Second Coming, there are a lot of little ones.  Every time Christ comes into someones heart, Christ has come again.  Peace, Will.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \",\"Hello  I've got an old Trident 8800CS SVGA card, but lacking suitable drivers for windows 3.1.

Thanks in advance  Jouni\",\"After reading the debate over the Clipper, I have a few things to add.   First, most of the people I know who activly use encryption privately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate, and any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the US. All they care about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That, after all IS the bottom line.    Second, if I look at all the people I know who use any form of encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who still insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people  looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think of anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves their methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make mistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are just as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else.    Third, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly familiar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption stratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that someone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip. That despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can  not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.   Fourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid people out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the  built in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to do any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going to run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start looking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption.     If nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However, the truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into simply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything else. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do not think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be slowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to  convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything, the Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.    The bottom line here is that people will use what works, and unavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption related charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty charges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.  The other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide  useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is out of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box has been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindness to this that I've found utterly stunning, and the Clipper Chip, along with the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger degree.

It is a 14\\\" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed specifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video capabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci.  All it takes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is about $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of comparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for half a year and I love it.

A genocide of Armenians took place during peacetime.  And it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in those days. He was still young. Born in 1926.  On that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there  was unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we  didn't think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they wouldn't go into people's apartments. About five o'clock we saw a large crowd  near the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home  watching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir  Street. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our  house is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields there. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the  direction of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and  started shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off  the light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the light. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn't know  and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.  Suddenly there's pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us: there were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother Aleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War  II and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.  We went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down  with axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, \\\"What's going on? What's  happened?\\\" They say, \\\"Armenians, get out of here!\\\" We don't open the door, we  say, \\\"If we have to leave, we'll leave, we'll leave tomorrow.\\\" They say, \\\"No,  leave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!\\\" By now they've  broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best we can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other.  We had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment, and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and when the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We  held the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an  axe, and then with a crowbar.  When the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them  with the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars,  pipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father  in the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the room, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother Sasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he was the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured  several of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But  they, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there were many of them.  The door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go  into the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought  skewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father  bleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head,  and his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw  that. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove them down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the  bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in  there, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to  chase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of  about 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and Mother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and  started calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through the windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no  one came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader  of the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a  fur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: \\\"What's with you,  woman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?\\\" She says, \\\"What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!\\\" My father  was a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian  and Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says,  \\\"The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he  brought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.\\\" He says, \\\"You  don't need to shout, stop shouting.\\\" And when they heard the voice of this  man, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and  started running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left,  too. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don't  know if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even though we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started  to massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to  call an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all  evening and all through the night.  Somewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were  from Khachmas. They said, \\\"We heard that a group was here at your place, you  have our condolences.\\\" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay in the room.  So we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well, we say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. Somewhere around  one o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy,  investigators. They say, \\\"Leave everything just how it is, we're coming back  here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\\\" Then people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take  Father away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take  Father away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times, but no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the  neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should  hide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and  went up to the neighbor's.  The excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles, ZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a  landing force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A crowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings 19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking  into Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians  weren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they  poured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were  some Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. \\\"They're up there, still, up there. Let's go kill them!\\\" They broke up all the furniture remaining in  the two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding  one floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door  shouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling  the corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it,  and the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, \\\"No, that's from some of the  furniture.\\\" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed  him down.  The mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. They smashed open the door and  went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also Armenians, they had left for another city.  The father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, \\\"Are you  crazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don't you now they're checking all the  apartments? They could kill you and them!\\\" And to us :\\\" . . . Come on, leave  this apartment!\\\" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. At first the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and he relented. We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. We heard the sound of motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went  downstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the  other rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down.  They left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal  they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our Microdistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.  With the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were  saved. Our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely  accidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the  crowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only able to save Mother. We couldn't save Father. We inflicted many injuries on  the bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We  were also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our share. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the  troops. And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been  even greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the  genocide.  Through an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the  leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their  orders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to ' pick up Father's corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o'clock  in the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was  quite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried  Father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were  about six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It  was gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people  there, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being taken to Baku. There was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well,  there was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. It  was something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The  child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a  man there, too, several men. You couldn't tell anything because their faces  were disfigured, they were in such awful condition...  Now two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what  happened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my  father, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue.  I still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was established, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what  happened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.  I'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. They even fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel  mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They  weren't afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our  troops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right across from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The  inhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the  soldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They  weren't afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were  at the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket  office I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing  Armenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that  they were being burned. During those days no one from the police department  came to anyone's aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though perhaps they could have come and saved us.  As we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus  station. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in  fighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in  which buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had lists, the bandits. You can tell that the \\\"operation\\\" was  planned in advance.  Thanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to the leadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian people, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops  suffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my  family and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait Armenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would have happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.  At present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR Procuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest possible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could  happen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted out for such deeds.  Very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass  disturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught, very few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There  were around 80 people near our building alone, that's how many people took  part in the pogrom of our building all in all.  They should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that  retribution awaits those who perform such acts.

One big problem is that there isn't room for a standard NuBus card inside the LC III.  noah\",\"  Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first? You can quote SCSI specs till you're blue in the face, but if they exceed the ISA bus capability, then what's the point?  Who says IDE is limited to 5 megs/sec?  What about VLB-IDE?  Does anyone know how they perform?   As implimented on what system?     Given the original question (SCSI used only as a single hard drive controller),  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do at least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence? What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost?   The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).

Which version of the Bible is the perfectly preserved one?  And why are there so many translations that are not perfectly preserved?  Is God trying to confuse us?   But that is exactly what happend.  There are so many branches of  denominations of Christianity and deviations of doctrine portruding from varying translations of biblical texts by \\\"serious students\\\" that are much too numerous to begin to count.  If there is a Perfect Bible, then there would be no possible misinterpretation and there would be no need for anyone here to be debating it.  On the other hand, maybe the Bible is perfect, but no one on this planet is perfect enough to read it correctly, but then there would be no point in God giving us something we cannot use correctly.   IMHO, if you trust your salvation on the reliability of a single book, you are on weak ground.  Remember, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  This Word existed BEFORE the Bible was written.  (Note: Word <==> God).  This Word that John is trying to describe cannot be fully described in any written language, all languages being IMPERFECT.  Realization comes only from contemplation of the Word, and is outside the boundaries of language.  I use the Bible as a guide, a stepping stone, but in no way is it my final authority. God alone is the final authority.\",\" Me too! And any Yankee Stadium gifs as well, please.  Thanx in advance,\",\"Hello.  I have the following for sale.  Most of the books are in perfect condition.

John Dominic Crossan (Professor of Religion at De Paul Univ)- _The Cross That Spoke_ Harper and Row Pub. 1988, Also his latest work  _The Historical Jesus - The Life of A Mediterranean Jewish Peasant_ Harper and Row Pub. 1991,  Also two works of Burton Mack (Professor of New Testament at the Claremont Graduate School) _A Myth of Innocence_ Fortress Press 1988, And his latest book _The Lost Gospel: The Book of Q and Christian Origins_ Harper and Row, 1992.  You might start with Mack's book on Q and then  examine the others afterward.  However I think that once you do that you will see that your \\\"evidence\\\" is not as sturdy as you'd like.  Most of the tired arguements you stated, assume eyewitness accounts, such is not the case.

If you are going to do a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.  With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed more now then ever.

If Boston had Alomar, Olerud, Henke, and Ward while Toronto had Rivera, Jack Clark, Jeff Reardon, things would have looked a little different last fall.  Give credit where credit is due.  This lavishing of praise on Morris makes me sick.   I'm willing to bet they don't finish sixth.  I'm also willing to bet they don't finish first.

Last week I posted a similar question to alt.wedding.  Now I come in search of a deeper-level answer.  My fiance is Lutheran and I am Catholic.  We plan on getting married in her church because she is living there now and I plan on moving there in a month or so.

Needless to say that I have found that there is no \\\"hard and fast\\\" rule when it comes to how the Catholic law for interfaith weddings is interpreted. But I'm pretty sure that we CAN get married without too much problem; the trick lies in the letter of dispensation.  But that is not why I am here....

Somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this.  The reason is very simple:  How many people do you want to die in a riot?  In a new Civil War?   Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it, and I'm worried that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens and paper.    Can people work within the system before trying to break it?  Examine your history books, and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic (or Democratic style) governments.  I think you'll only find one in over five thousand years of written history.  That's not very good odds.

This is the difference between self-defence and murder.\\\"  Let's try to avoid killing things, eh?

The trap is the easy way out.  For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race, and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors leading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than not, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.  If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few Blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable or whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to define \\\"us\\\" and \\\"other\\\" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational humans.  It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the *most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial makeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in San Francisco, a city that loves to tout its \\\"ethnic diversity\\\". Here, we have Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the \\\"model minority\\\") gangs, and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and crime are what they most fear. During the \\\"disturbance\\\" in Los Angeles last year many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I remember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned from TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives that live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly multi-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black* riot!  In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points that really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem becomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly believe that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current course of denial and repression.  I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors, luck in avoiding the \\\"trap\\\".   Peace, my brother.    m. --    \",\"I want to start of list for Syclone and Typhoon owners.

Our lawyers do not work on contingency, so that if you were to sue for malpractice then you'd better be sure of winning to cover your fees ... likewise, if you were a doctor and subject of a suit, it's time to sweat.   A few weeks ago, the president of the Canadian MA wrote a letter to the NYT to decry a lobbyist's advert repeating the same old trash. This is significant because the AMA and the CMA are interlinked organizations and he would not have done it without the approval  of his AMA cronies.   It serves the same purpose as the Bethesda Naval Hospital ... since not all hospitals can provide everything, maybe they have some stuff that others don't?  (Ottawa's population is only a quarter million, if you include the surrounding counties.)   People of influence will get their way in any system, American or European.  It's the \\\"Golden Rule\\\" - he who has the gold makes the rules. (-;  As for annual budgets, those are actually annual grants for facilities (e.g., mops, pans, etc.) given to hospitals of which most are private nonprofit foundations (btw, I have no problem with having aggressive for-profit hospitals like the French, who use our approach ... but in the Paris region they have almost as many people as Canada does so their market is much more diverse).  The rest has to be made up for by billings from patients who use their services.   The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay, and  are compiled use the same methods by the OECD that yield  the 13-14% figure for the U.S.   How?  They are collecting premiums ... and I'm an advocate of having copayments like the French do in their system in order to make it look more like the real insurance that it is.  The private doctors and  hospitals will still be there after the insurance (hypothically) disappears, as they were there before it appeared.   For one thing, I think that Bob Rae is an idiot ...   Most of OHIP comes from separate premiums on your paycheck if you are a player ...  he wants to spend our money on other things than the health insurance.  Our high taxes are high for other spending but health insurance, which is separate and optional, and it is being  spent in a nonpartisan manner by every party. )-;  OHIP is just a health insurance plan; it does not provide any kind of health care, that is up to you and your private doctors.   Some of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries of American companies, and their parents provide full insurance down here.  Regardless, all firms up north can easily turn on cable TV to see how well the American firms are doing by being involved in basic coverage.  The private firms are making too much money after having gotten rid of basic coverage.  They run around patting them- selves on the back for their own cooperation in providing extras  for those people who \\\"deserve it\\\".   I agree ... they were in a win-win situation.  But right now, it seems that they have won bigger, when you look at how full their coffers are.  Friends from my sisters' MBA class were still being flown out for job interviews individually with insurance firms in London, ON, (Canada's insurance capitol a la Hartford) along with generous expense privileges this year despite the ongoing post-recession blues.  gld\",\"    >    >    >>Jagr has a higher +/-, but Francis has had more points.

Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty      plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.       Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice      time per game and some measure of its \\\"quality\\\" (i.e., is the player put out      in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up      against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would      much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious      merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.  Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play.  In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get 90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.  (By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games). \",\"Acorn Software, Inc. has 3 tape drives (currently used on a VMS system) for sale.

Generally, these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, for example, we have the following set regarding children:   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to   the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum   [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem   families and received as servants when they are left alone through   the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect   all such children in your province and send them to the places of   deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to   the people.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [1]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the   time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their   lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.      Minister of the Interior,       Talaat\\\" [2]   \\\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.    November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the   orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their   places of exile.        Abdullahad Nuri. [3]    \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been   opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is   done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt   of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or   any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it   purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as   detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received   into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish   special orphanages for them.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat.\\\" [4]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.     Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures   to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with   the caravans.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [5]   \\\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.    At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows   of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is   not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by   Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble   in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned   out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of   deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent   away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [6]  In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \\\"rationalizing\\\" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:   \\\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for   its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks   it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I   shall die for it.\\\" [7]   These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these \\\"death march orders\\\" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.  For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.  If one were to examine the sample \\\"authentic text\\\" provided in the Turkish  Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it  too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the  Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or  Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery.   Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide  architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a  heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.  This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian.     - - - references - - -  [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60  [2] ibid, page 60  [3] ibid, page 60  [4] ibid, page 61  [5] ibid, page 61  [6] ibid, page 62  [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and     London), 1926, page 387  \",\"  Again, from my alcohol server's class: The absolute *most* that eating before drinking can do is slow the absorption down by 15 minutes.

All YOU address is your own convictions, regardless whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points of view, because you reject such interpretations without any consideration whatsoever.  # # The Bible states that Lucifer was created.

The Bible indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they \\\"belong to\\\" or follow God in His footsteps.  Satan and his followers have rebelled against God, and are not \\\"children (=followers/redeemed) of God,\\\" but it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of salvation.  # #        The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the #        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked \\\"one\\\"; #        (Matthew 13:38)  kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus (and have shown \\\"works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the wicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.

I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other faiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different way or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission and progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited every continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.  #  This is really a red herring.

The indication from Rick is that they may #  certainly be.  The issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis- represent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of \\\"official doctrine\\\" is obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial (e.g. \\\"The Seven Deadly Heresies\\\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best, or erroneous at worst (\\\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation\\\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations (his book \\\"Mormon Doctrine\\\" is oftentimes referred to as \\\"McConkie's Bible\\\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books! (The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen.

When food  manufacturers add it to a preparation, they do so because it's a  known flavor enhancer.   Your wife's theory, that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite,  may well be true.

No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if you're grounded in some other way at the same time.    The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.    They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere, repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.)  What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact, depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.  There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers.

What I have seen from the March Beta is that it doesn't yet come with the stuff which exploits multi-user features. I remember somebody from MS stating that it doesn't allow two users share one GUI. My interpretation of this was that one user per console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want.   I believe ftp and rlogin deamons for NT systems will come from third party. Somebody already has a Beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the net. There is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like csh on Unix for remote logins.   In general I liked NT when I checked it out. It slow compared to Win3.1 (just like any other real OS). The beta version, although being slow, botts up much faster than my SUN workstation. Windows subsystems also start up a lot faster than X windows. I believe Bill Gates was right when he stated that NT was not for everybody. After playing around with it for a while I was convinced. If I owned a busines using a \\\"business computer\\\" from IBM or some other established vendor, I would consider moving to NT platform because it would provide a much cheaper solution (If you are running SQL servers etc.). It provides the robustness such an application requires.   On the other hand if you like your DOS games, more or less forget about NT. You can always boot to DOS  but in general that defeats the purpose of using NT. Most of NT's features are visible in a networked environment and in such an environment you can't reboot your machine at will. For personal use, I would rather wait for the Win32 based Windows release (whatever you name it) than jump to NT bandwagon. I expect most applications will keep on using Win16 until Win32 becomes widely available.  \",\" And doubtless, when an atheist does an act of charity they temporarily become a Baptist.\",\" Depending on how you plan to use your SUV, I might recommend also browsing Trailer Boats and one or more of those Pickup, Shotgun, and 4WD magazines.  The car rags mostly seem to consider recently graded pea gravel to be offroading and ten sacks of redwood chips to be a bedload.  Considering that most of these SUVs seem to be  used mostly as robust station wagons, that's probably not a bad approach, but if your applications are more demanding, pick your information sources accordingly.  Of the three vehicles on your short list (Explorer, 4Runner,  Pathfinder), I'd recommend the 4Runner as being closely based  on a rather robust pickup and the Explorer for being comfortably  carlike.

Surely you don't wish for the Democrats to destroy our beloved country just so your party can get some trivial political advantage? That's rather a petty way to think. (Not that this pettiness doesn't extend all the way to the U.S. Senate, I've noticed...)  While Bush was president, I kept hoping and praying that he'd wise up. I couldn't stand the man, but I wish he'd done a decent job; if so, we might not be in the mess we are now, and that would be a small price to pay for suffering through another term of Republican control. Similarily, YOU should be hoping and praying that Clinton does a good job.

In that posting I made sure I used the word \\\"public\\\".  Public revelation contains God's truth intended for everyone to believe.  The revelation contained in the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation.  Private revelation is revelation that God gives to an individual.  He may speak directly to the individual, He may send an angel, or He may send the Virgin Mary or some lesser saint.  The only person who is required to believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed. Devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations, but doctrines can not.  When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)  I do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in evaluating an alleged private revelation--it's not something I need every day--but I know that one of the primary requirements is that nothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything known through public revelation ------- Marty Helgesen Bitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu\",\"SOMEONE PLEASE BUY THESE BOOKS!!!!!

Thanks for any tips ---> Robert rgasch@nl.oracle.com\",\" Perhaps it is because witnesses who have left the compound have all testified that the BATF shot first, they they did not identify themselves before tossing in concussion grenades (not that anyone inside could have _heard_ such identification after being near a concussion grenade) and the announcement from the BATF that they have sealed the warrant under which they were operating - which was a _search_ warrant, by the way, _not_ an arrest warrant.  In short, perhaps because the BATF is wildly out of control and perhaps calmer heads have realized that bombing a compound full of woman and children will not improve their position. There is a real chance that Koresh will be able to prove self-defense in court.  That will leave - what? - four officers dead and no one to blame but the BATF.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability      of these products.         \",\"There was a recent discussion of Dungeons and Dragons and other role playing games.  Since there is a lot of crossover between gamers and science fiction and fantasy fans, I will mention that I am the editor and publisher of RADIO FREE THULCANRA, a Christian-oriented science fiction fanzine.  It is not a Christian magazine with a special interest in science fiction.  It is a science fiction fanzine with a special interest in Christianity.

Certainly it is not by human reason.  Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase Sartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing.  Your logic comes to fruition in relativism.    Ah, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in contemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus ('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of language he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary framework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but a threshold.   vonWrights's comment that Witt's \\\"sentences have a content that often lies deep beneath the surface of language.\\\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing ourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with Witt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes in our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it is already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man.  Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.    This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in it conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of understanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \\\"as a man thinketh, so he is.\\\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside, that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals of truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that there is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too are knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the individual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to Christianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the Spirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has the capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not only has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep things of GOd that are absolute and true.    There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced and it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.    \\\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would say unto me.\\\"  Job 23ff  --Rex\",\"     \",\"  (Deletion)   You have demanded harsh punishments of several crimes. Repeating offenders have slipped in only as justification of harsh punishment at all. Typically religious doublespeak. Whenever you have contradictory statements you choose the possibility that suits your current argument.   It is disgusting that someone with ideas that would make Theodore KKKaldis feel cozy can go along under the protection of religion.\",\"    Which provided the basis for the denoument of the film which introduced Errol Flynn to the world.  (Love interest was Olivia de Havilland, who went on to appear with Flynn in 7 more films.)  [Exercise for non-old-movie buffs: what film was this?] [Exercise for old movie buffs: what were the 7 more films?]\",\"     More correctly: when people die, they cease to exist.     The idea I've gotten is that to christians, Hell is -- like Heaven --  afterlife; i.e, you don't cease to exist, but are subjected to eternal   torture (well, that's the orthodox idea anyway; \\\"eternal death\\\" if you  prefer that). Atheists don't believe in any sort of afterlife.    I think it's safe to say that Hell was never intended metaphorical. Certainly  not the equivalent of ceasing to exist. Some christian concepts are indeed  metaphors, but your idea of Hell is a 20th century interpretation. It is, of  course, nice to see that even christianity might evolve to fit the worldview   of modern age, but I fear the church will not accept it. Understandably, per-  haps, because if you accept that Hell is a metaphor, then you're one step  closer to turning God into a metaphor as well.\",\"Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child

    "When we plot multiple `explorer`s for the same `dataset`, it makes sense to synchronize selections between those plots. `hover` recipes take care of this synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   :tada: This also works with cumulative selections. Consequently, the cumulative toggle is synchronized too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each filter is narrowing down the selections we make, joint filters is just set intersection, extended\n",
    "\n",
    "-   from two sets (original selection + filter)\n",
    "-   to N sets (original selection + filter A + filter B + ...)\n",

    "The [`active_learning` recipe]((../t1-active-learning/)) is built of `softlabel + annotator + finder`, plus a few widgets for iterating the model-in-loop.\n",

    "In the next tutorial(s), we will see more recipes taking advantage of linked selections and joint filters. Powerful indeed!"
