The interesting thing to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware - a Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK, while a Sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior on NCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs.

The NHL TV deal was very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this one-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the season started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by squeezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota game) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball telecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last night).  But the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.  They must honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have something to do with it, especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach of contract with baseball.  So relax.  I'm happy.

But they have been systematically            IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                  The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the \\\"Reciprocal System\\\", is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) \\\"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\\\"                      (2) \\\"The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\\\"                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called \\\"UNIT VELOCITY\\\" and \\\"THE NATURAL            DATUM\\\").                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.                  All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy            complex mathematics, in his books.                   BOOKS of Dewey B.

This is the            organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.             They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson's lack of a fancy \\\"PH.D.\\\" degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a \\\"unified field theory\\\" that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      \\\"Modern physics\\\" does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that \\\"epicycles\\\", \\\"crystal spheres\\\",            \\\"geocentricity\\\", \\\"flat earth theory\\\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson's organization, \\\"THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\\\", and Editor of            their quarterly Journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   \\\"Super Collider\\\" BOONDOGGLE!                           I am AGAINST contruction of the \\\"Superconducting Super            Collider\\\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \\\"scientific\\\"            value.                      Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (\\\"mesons\\\", \\\"hyperons\\\", ALLEGED \\\"quarks\\\", etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of \\\"fire ants\\\" eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the \\\"Supercollider\\\"?!                                 Naming the \\\"Super Collider\\\" after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls \\\"Unit Velocity\\\" and the \\\"Natural Datum\\\".                       In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help \\\"prove\\\" Einstein's \\\"General Theory of Relativity\\\".                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \\\"General Relativity\\\" can, by            INSTEAD using \\\"SPECIAL Relativity\\\".  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \\\"General Relativity\\\" as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \\\"Special            Relativity\\\", including the parts about \\\"mass increases\\\" near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term \\\"COORDINATE TIME\\\" when writing            about this.]                            In regard to \\\"mass increases\\\", it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called \\\"Big Bang\\\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \\\"THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION\\\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the \\\"3-degree\\\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory's success:            In his first book in 1959, \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE\\\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from \\\"neutron stars\\\" in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the \\\"Cosmic Sector\\\".  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\"            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by \\\"fusion\\\".  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the \\\"MAIN SEQUENCE\\\" from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \\\"degenerate matter\\\", \\\"neutron            stars\\\", \\\"black holes\\\", etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \\\"mini\\\" white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode's Law.                         \\\"Black Hole\\\" FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \\\"black            holes\\\" merging together into a SINGLE \\\"black hole\\\", and            concluded that the new \\\"black hole\\\" would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original \\\"black holes\\\".                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \\\"black            holes\\\", etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", it is            clear to me that \\\"black holes\\\" are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \\\"black            hole\\\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to \\\"prove\\\" their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical            problem somehow makes him \\\"wiser\\\".  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book \\\"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\\\", by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      \\\"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \\\"NOTHING BUT            MOTION\\\"] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\\\"                            Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the \\\"unit\\\" rate).             (\\\"Unit velocity\\\" is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \\\"above\\\" and            \\\"below\\\" labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\\\".                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            \\\"science\\\" (or \\\"physics\\\", or \\\"astronomy\\\", etc.), as well as            the \\\"scientific\\\" literature and the \\\"education\\\" systems, to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have.                      Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.                                  For more information, answers to your questions, etc.,            please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS).

I just had another close : one last night. Preparing for a right turn on a two lane road. Right turn : signals on, starting the turn, and this lady behind me hits the throttle and : starts to pass me on the RIGHT.  This has happened to me twice before.  the  I have had this happen to me often enough that I always look for it. On my ride to work in the morning I come to a stop light where there are 3 lanes in my direction.  One for left turns, one for straight through, and one for right turns.  All clearly marked.  Plus there is a clearly marked  bicycle lane.  I ride into the right turn lane with my signal on and stop at  the stop line.  Looking left to see if I can make a \\\"right turn on red\\\" and when I start to move discovered that some idiot has pulled into the bike lane and is trying to pass me on the right.  GRRR.    I always do a head check on bike lanes.  Not always for bicycles. . .\",\"I need the file format for cc:Mail file formats - it seems to be PCX-based, but with a twist: only the first page of a multi-page fax will come out readable.

Does this mean that open carry is allowed?  If so, just how 'open' does it have to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  What if one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also, is there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed, period?   Question #2  As I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns. Is there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if you were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting in your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending  trial for the shooting? Also, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available,  either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).   One more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being rich or famous or related to the mayor?\",\"Is anyone familiar with Doug Sturm?\",\"============================================================================= NOTE: This is being posted for a friend.

A 2.7 per cent annual population growth rate implies a doubling in 69/2.7 \\\\approx 25 years. Can you imagine that? Most people seem not able to, and that is why so many deny that this problem exists, for me most especially in the industrialised countries (low growth rates, but large environmental impact). Iran's high growth rate threatens things like accelerated desertification due to intensive agriculture, deforestation, and water table drop. Similar to what is going on in California (this year's rain won't save you in Stanford!).

I know that a lot of the ads in the back of PS are fringe science or questionablely legal, but this one really grabbed my attention. It was from a company name \\\"Personal Missle, Inc.\\\" or something like that.  Anyhow, the ad stated that they'd sell rockets that were up to 20' in length and engines of sizes \\\"F\\\" to \\\"M\\\".  They also said that some rockets will reach 50,000 feet.  Now, aside from the obvious dangers to any amateur rocketeer using one of these beasts, isn't this illegal?  I can't imagine the FAA allowing people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes. Not to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down.

It's odometer turned 90k and the sensor light started blinking. I went to the dealer and he said it was a maintenance light saying I need to change the Oxygen sensor. He said, It is to be changed every 30k, but since I bought the car when it had 77k, I don't know if the same thing happened at 30k and 60k.  He quoted $198 for the part and $50 to install it. The part cost $30 outside, but the mechanic I went to could not fix it saying the sensor is placed too deep in the engine parts. He suggested I wait till it malfunctions before I do anything.

It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would more accurately respond to motions from the Earth's gravity field and ignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. The ball itself would then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity anisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously adjusting its position to compensate for drag. \",\"Hey Serdar,            What nationality are you anyway?

This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride    (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty,     fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).  Communication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler back every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled Magna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you  can't really communicate.  Balance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how they're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately and lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning thing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a pain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay perpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn and WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always screws up the line I've picked out.  Here's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:  - attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.  - Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not    get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount    in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)  - Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)  - We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many    first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)  - Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and    we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're    confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel    of it.  Or just hug me tight.    - Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be     gradual, so I can compensate.  - Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.  - Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right     thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how    to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to    stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to     watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84,     and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, \\\"SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED\\\"     I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with     the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.    Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the    instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her    experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to     trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)  Usually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes,  tires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers. Helps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.  Watch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little mudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will be nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones. It doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the  first trip!  Good luck -- have fun!\",\" Dan Johnson-  You don't know me, but take this hand anyway.  Bravo for GO(DS) = 0.

Pick it up, hold it about a foot from your face and look closely    at the saftey lever.  If it has two positions, its an AR-15, if    it has three, its an M-16.  There are numerous internal differences    as well, but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see    them, they are not valid in this discussion.  So, in conclusion,    there is very little external differences to distinguish an AR-15    from an M-16 except at close (very close) range.

[HE] Homeland? First Nagarno-Karabagh was Armenians homeland today [HE] Fizuli, Lacin and several villages (in Azerbadjan) [HE] are their homeland. Can't you see the [HE] the  \\\"Great Armenia\\\" dream in this?  Greater Armenia would stretch from Karabakh, to the Black Sea, to the Mediterranean, so if you use the term \\\"Greater Armenia\\\" use it with care.  [HE]    With facist methods like [HE] killing, raping and bombing villages. The last move was the  [HE] blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees, trying to [HE] escape the from Lacin, a city that was \\\"given\\\" to the Kurds [HE] by the Armenians.   It has always been up to the Azeris to end their announced winning of Karabakh  by removing the Armenians! When the president of Azerbaijan, Elchibey, came to  power last year, he announced he would be be \\\"swimming in Lake Sevan [in  Armeniaxn] by July\\\". Well, he was wrong! If Elchibey is going to shell the  Armenians of Karabakh from Aghdam, his people will pay the price! If Elchibey  is going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price! If  Elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of  Kelbajar, his people will pay the price.   It also seems other non-Azeri minorities in Azerbaijan have understood they are next in line in this process of forced Azerification or deportation. Just  look at the situation with the Lezgians.  About the Kurds...what Kurds! According to the Azerbaijani government, there  are no Kurds in Azerbaijan. Can't they make up their minds? Oh I see, there  are only Kurds when the Azeris want them to be Kurds! And anyway, this \\\"60  Kurd refugee\\\" story, as have other stories, are simple fabrications sourced in  Baku, modified in Ankara. Other examples of this are Armenia has no border  with Iran, and the ridiculous story of the \\\"intercepting\\\" of Armenian military  conversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by  somebody unknown, from Armenian into Azeri Turkish, submitted by an unnamed  \\\"special correspondent\\\" to the NY Times from Baku. Real accurate!  [h]       However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane  [h]       to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one [h]       that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane [h]       (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA. [h]  No, Henrik, these Turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked.  [HE] Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 American Cargo planes [HE] were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities [HE] announced that they were going to search these cargo  [HE] planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany. [HE] 5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of [HE] of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not [HE] humanitarian aid.....  Your \\\"facts\\\" in error. Shipments of all kinds that have transversed Turkey  have been either searched, re-routed or confiscated. Some American planes were searched, others were re-routed, others were untouched. Rail shipments  were held up last fall and last winter from entering Armenian from Turkey for the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of Armenia. Wheat was confiscated, other shipments were exchanged with \\\"crap\\\" and dirt, then shipped to Armenia. U.S. planes don't have to use Turkish air bases. The U.S. uses these bases to bomb Iraq. Anyway, U.S. planes can fly over Georgia, which they have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish  chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed  anything other than a paranoid Turkish military.   [HE] Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about. [HE] since it's content is announced to be weapons?   Well, big mouth Ozal said military weapons are being provided to Azerbaijan from Turkey, yet Demirel and others say no. No wonder you are so confused!  [HE] Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons [HE] to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan [HE] it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons [HE] since it's content is announced to be weapons?   You are correct, all Turkish planes should be simply shot down!

Ask yourself this.  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least partially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly evaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released) The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't.  There is other hardware out there not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)  My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper systems.  If not we're in trouble.  Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like to think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this. They know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken seriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step in the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the \\\"Clipper\\\" system is easily justified \\\"Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying to subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever.\\\" How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system the only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administration knows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for drug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.  Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid. Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations collective I.Q. is about that of a potato.  Why do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big, and NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the stuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why the hell would they jump the gun?   I really wonder.  To wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:  The White House Office of the Press Secretary c/o: Presidential Comment Line (fax) (202) 456-2461   April 17, 1993   Sir and/or Madam:     I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and cryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.   It is apparent to me that those who drafted the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \\\"Big Brother Proposal\\\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep      ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \\\"experts\\\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.   In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \\\"tamper proof\\\" the key escrows might be.   I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti      lize the \\\"Big Brother Chip.\\\"   Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \\\"harmony,\\\" \\\"right to encryption,\\\" and \\\"voluntary.\\\"   It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \\\"I can't believe it's happening here.\\\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \\\"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\\\"           Most Concerned,         [Signature]       Shaen Logan Bernhardt I uni@acs.bu.edu \",\" I'm afraid that I've lost the thread here.  I didn't suggest that all  government regulations be subject to referenda.  So I don't follow the  comments above.   I mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally undesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw support among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate.  Furthermore, I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an industrial society because the weight of litigation and/or misery it would produce would effectively crush productive effort.  No, I'm not surprised.  I just think it's interesting that on one hand libertarians assume a limited government can be decreed, yet on the other posit an entire government made up of people who carry guns.  (I realize that many libertarians assume that such a government will be  counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry, but it is worth noting that widespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the establishment of totalitarian government, e.g. Iraq.)  Yup, sure do.  But since I also support the constitutional requirement that the government provide for the general welfare (Article I section 8), I'm willing to justify such programs on that basis.  Well, in the first place, I don't support a \\\"socialized economic system.\\\" I think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea.  But it is not the case that \\\"any third party...is...as likely to be ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller.\\\"  There are multitudes of examples where such a statement is demonstrably false.

We ran into one of my relatives at the  bus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away, near the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a fellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, \\\"What are you standing here for? Go home immediately!\\\" I asked, \\\"What's going on?\\\" He says,  \\\"What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're  killing Armenians!\\\" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.  We sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our  courtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were  about 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They were shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice  or two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35. They went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and  throwing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one  has a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a  guitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.  We had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School  No. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families  there with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only  known Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani  guard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was  nowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We  were told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our  microdistrict.  We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.  On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be used to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of  them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I asked him for assistance. I say, \\\"We're in School No. 33, we need to be  evacuated.\\\" Well he says, \\\"Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now.\\\"  I know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with him personally. When I called he said, \\\"Muslimzade here.\\\"  About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out the window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, \\\"Armenians, come  out, we're here to get you.\\\" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in  their hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, \\\"Where should I go?\\\" I  say, \\\"If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that  the Armenians were here and that they left.\\\" That's what he did. He went down  there and said, \\\"The Armenians were here,\\\" he said, \\\"I let them out the back  door, they went that way.\\\" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and  noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.  So the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right! Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that Muslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that  we were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the  morning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.  In the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers  took us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there  were lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy,  about three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor,  nothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was just very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything they could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his  mother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...  I searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I wanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third floor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping,  with their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of  them.  There were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten,  everyone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City Party Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage  was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being sold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to  get the things any cheaper.  I met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in his eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we  worked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw  me and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his  feelings, of course.

I've been seeing  her every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28)  and during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every  4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period.  As it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that  though I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she  mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13  weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had  an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no  problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain  in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very  difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or  move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for  when I do need to go out.)   Anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from  the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about  2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.   (I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating  very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well  now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile  related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my  upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I  was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because  it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt   no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I  ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had  turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if  I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it  wasn't as much of a problem.  So the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid  fatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware  of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have  been avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat  foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.    But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat  except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts,  fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I  should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only  have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day (  potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in  a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or  steamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have  some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if  I'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it  from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if  she's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her  recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on  cholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She  originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the  entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I  started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and  she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also  asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them  are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain,  and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did  want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be  temporary for that one week.   What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I  would understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying  that anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she  assumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that  because of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to  use the energy from the food I do eat.   Any opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm  truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet  because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few  minutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I  don't find any foods satisfying.

Hope you like it.      Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti        Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti,     the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven. She was a cheerful     girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but     one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.      The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on     the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-     nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally     arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and     give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon     on the  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love     we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to     die rather than commit a mortal sin.      Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy     Eucharist. Her  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father's     absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the rest  of  the     day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is     until         -4-            her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.     Thus ended the happiest day of Maria's life.      Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling     little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her     mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband, Maria     took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.     She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the     Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti's, owning     a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other     children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she     did the Holy Will of God.      During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son) twice     made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On     both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro's     strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she     even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria lived     in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.       On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  \\\"get  a     handkerchief,\\\"  as he  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath     the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the     baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered     what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a     91/2\\\"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told     him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He     stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia     instantly realized what he was up to. \\\"No, No, No! Do  not touch     me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!\\\" At this point Alessandro     held the knife over Maria's chest, who was now on the floor.      \\\"Will you or will you not?\\\" Maria gathered all her energy. \\\"No I     will  not, Alessandro,  no!\\\"   She had chosen her martyrdom over     sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the     knife  into   Maria's  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to     his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the     knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying     of the baby Teresa on  the  landing  brought  the attention  to     Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended     and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find     Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.     When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   \\\"He     wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.\\\"      The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro away.     As the  ambulance carried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd     followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for     poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First     Communion         -5-            came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.     He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  \\\"Yes.  For the     love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me     in Paradise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have.\\\" Maria     died at about three o'clock.      Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria's  death  but     because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in     prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-     ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of     a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to     him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God's par-     don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony     in Maria's  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,     on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the     first mother ever to be present at her daughter's canonisation.      May St. Maria Goretti help us  to be  pure  and  grant  us  the     strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.

What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith (i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal revelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God  must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would  honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone  who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are  rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient  for them, or because they wish to spurn God.  I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one  holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is  that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with God.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or  revealed that truth.    --  comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\",\" Yeah, Cancer is pretty cool, isn't it.\",\" However, also be aware that Implementor's notes are basicly recommendations, they are *NOT* part of the spec.

Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:  02106@chopin.udel.edu or 02106@ravel.udel.edu or 02106@bach.udel.edu or 02106@brahms.udel.edu  NO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!! LOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!!  Shipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).

There have been bad habits of mine that I've decided to put forth the effort to break, and I've done so; there have been other bad habits that I've decided are not worth the effort to break.  It's my choice, either way.  I am my own master.  I choose what I want to do.  I weigh the benefits of my actions against their consequences, and I use my experience to help me deal with the unexpected, which in turn make me more experienced.  I don't always succeed, but I never fail, either -- I learn.  Do *you* have any habits you can't break?  Why not?   I have arrived at my own understanding of Christianity, just as you've probably arrived at your own understanding of Islam that is most likely very different from the way a Moslem thinks of his religion. Are you \\\"unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the Quran\\\"?  If that's different, then how is it different from what you accuse me of?  Can I accuse you of having no desire to understand even the slightest concept of atheism?   Of COURSE not.  That's disgusting.  For centuries, religions have been discriminating on sex and treating women as second-class humans; that's one of the reasons I renounced my Christianity.   No.  I don't insult people.  Period.  It's not in my nature, and it's not something that I want to do, either.   Not yet -- but my life is the ground I use to practice on.  The fun is in the getting there!   We don't start out perfect; we've got to strive to be something better.  I know my shortcomings, and I know my strengths, and I live my life according to the decisions I make, and I am content to abide with the consequences of my decisions as easily as I'll accept the praise for them.  There have been times in my life when I've made mistakes, yes; I try to never make the same mistake twice.   I regard Christ as a myth.  I feel that there are far too many people offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and did.  The only person who can really judge me is *me*.  I choose the roads I travel, and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of any given road or turn back -- and as long as I don't *always* turn back, there's no shame in it.  When I need help, I seek out my friends.   And you don't have a clue about what I'm saying, either.  Open your eyes and SEE; open your ears and LISTEN.  I'm not just spouting off empty words.  This is my LIFE, this is what gives me MEANING.   Huh?  You're going WAY off the track here.  I say my mother loves me.  How do I know, you ask?  I can point to definite things she's done for me, and I can even just bring her to you so you can ask her, face-to-face.  You say your deity loves you.  How do you know, I ask?  You can't even convince me that it exists!   If any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot, promising untold pleasures to me if I'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my rationality for just this once, then I would choose 'hell'.  I can *not* lie to myself to placate another being, no matter how powerful it is.  Note also that there are several gods trying to lure me this way: Yahweh, Allah, Zeus, Odin, Ra...  Please give me a solid reason to choose one of them over the others.

You play the skee-ball over and over because you'd like to get better at it, even though you're not going to win anything better than a stuffed animal even if you blow ten dollars on it.  You ride the roller coaster because it's an thrilling experience, even though (because?) it scares the dickens out of you.  In the same way, I think life is fun.

Science has its basis in observable fact.   I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on the values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such, is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human activity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or ethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.  Bill  : If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must : first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering : the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  : So, back to the original question:  : And objective morality is.....?  This may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory. Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of people. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The concept supposedly described may have meaning however.  If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then He has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His existence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed, He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an objective sense. If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective. If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous, meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to meet that standard is therefore objectively determined. Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural norm, or the preferred conduct of \\\"decent\\\" people, making it seem subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard. Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as\",\"    John, The problem here is that you have taken one peice of my response, without bothering to connect it with the other parts.  I have repeatedly noted that one needs to take the problematic historcity of acts and then examine the work of John Dominic Crossan and Burton Mack.  Once you have taken the time to examine recent developments in biblical scholarship, I think you will  grasp more clearly what I am saying.     Certainly this is an issue as I think the situation in Waco shows most  clearly.  If all that is required is that people are willing to die for a belief for it to be true, then surely David Koresh is the son of God.  No, the spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be willing to die must be put to rest.  The other problem is that it is so  monologocentric.  Even if the resurrection was a big deal (which it doesn't seem to have been for either Q, Thomas, or even John to a certain degree) there are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have been doing together that would have been worth dying for.  It is my belief that even the idea of a mixed race community, which brought down regional/national boundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be willing to die.  Radical communties do that (e.g. Jonestown, Waco, Warsaw, etc) But my original point was that roman persecution (which is the only persecution we have documented proof of) was not about whether a carpenter came back from the dead.  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman or greek mind.  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty (i.e. emperor worship) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothing to do with the resurrection at all.  When nero used christians as human  torches to light up his dinner party it wasn't because the believe in a  risen savior, it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and cannablism.  The argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection just cannot stand up to critical examination.\",\" Yeah, I'm sure that our lab would love a ride (he's the type that sticks his head out car windows) but I didn't think that he would enjoy being bungee- corded to the gas tank, and 65 lbs or squirming beast is a bit much for a backpack (ok who's done it....).\",\"I'd like to thank everyone who took the time to respond to my post about  fighting my ticket.

In case this puzzles people, I would like to expand on two of her comments.   One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context, scope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of evidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the back of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be filled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a grave mistake to confuse these.  Past snippets from this thread:    Back to Lee Lady:   These posters are making the mistake that I have previously criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A \\\"carefully designed and controlled study\\\" is neither always possible nor always important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing a remedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, we have enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind of claim to ask for a \\\"carefully designed and controlled study\\\" to alleviate our skepticism.)  Rules such as \\\"support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study\\\" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation. I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (To reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical problems are notoriously problematic.)  \",\"I heard third-hand (not the best form of information) that there was recently published results of a study on Multiple-Personality-Disorder Syndrome patients revealing some interesting clues that the root cause of allergy may have a psychological trigger or basis.

If we  unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity,  we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we  encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with  Christianity and reject what isn't.      We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine  the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch  and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.   Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our  lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and  service.  The command to love God with all one's mind means no fuzzy- headed drifting from idea to idea.    One Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope.  It is a frequent theme  in his writings.  Indeed, thoughtful Christians from most traditions  recognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of Christians.  It  too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith.

But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau)  was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost payload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from 2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competing with the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except now I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the  successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the early results are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in  Russia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue  their development.   The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton  is 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-D which sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know about launch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which are probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake things up pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragile thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now. Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know  how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track and erected on the pad?    They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads  (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the US at great cost.

What strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of Lucifer's fall - which, by the way, I seem to recall to be more speculation than based on biblical text, but my ex RCism may be showing - is that, as Benedikt pointed out, Lucifer had perfect nature, yet he had the free will to \\\"choose\\\" evil.  But where did that choice come from?  We know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a tempter which many assume was Satan, but how did Lucifer discover, invent, create, call the action what you will, something that God had not given origin to?  Also, where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer's free will? We make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes me as being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, like salvation, not one that all Christians believe in identically.  At least in my mind, salvation and free will are very tightly coupled, but then my theology was Roman Catholic...  Still, how do theologian explain Lucifer's fall?  If Lucifer had perfect nature (did man?) how could he fall?  How could he execute an act that (a) contradicted his nature and (b) in effect cause evil to exist for the first time?\",\"      No. This is only relevant for OpenWindows 3.x as shipped with SunOS.

Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by the Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so.  Andy Byler  [You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based on Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus' teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship occuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more time.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are right, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.  Accepting the principle of \\\"sola scriptura\\\" does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite clear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is on where the Bible would have us place the line.  By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters that are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free to determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that the Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or (since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to decide.\",\"That is correct.  in DOS you can use IRQ 7 for your SB.You can't do that under OS/2 because it uses IRQ 7 for the printer \",\"   Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else, one can get too much of a good thing.   Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries, essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her, necessarily.    Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected.     These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.    People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that \\\"pisses off\\\" their body. Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard, causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it.    See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly.  and brain damage.   The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin, and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.   poisoning.   Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating , say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home, plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of things.  But it might be the MSG.    If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.   Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.\",\"#1  Clayton, my man...  You are a tad out of touch....

And, I'll note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over five years -- I'd say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8^)   *  In the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what I meant by \\\"There is no way out of the loop\\\".  I wrote that human brains \\\"are infested with sin\\\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.    Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your conscience is properly formed?  The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the formed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure that your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation can be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll grant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.  Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be certain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is `properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)   Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:   The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation? How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or another -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?  You write:   But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I am confident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way from `confident'.  This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain (really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is significantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that you are confident, that invites people to ask why.  Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely certain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any idea of his own fallibility.   I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of them -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible. The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.   Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu  [This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the original criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong answers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal consequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is at least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that -- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are fallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these basic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's unlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of confidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for example said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell, and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and intolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's some chance I'm wrong.  Don't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant Christians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least some cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger. If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for certain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I think it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that way.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most difficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell what I think is the truth.\",\"Where could I find a description of the JPG file format?

I am not at all sure this is the best path to follow.  While the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the  revelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this revalation is the Church. I am not recommending any one denommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian congregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just reading the Bible.  This does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although I would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the Book of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are comfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to read the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable lack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really sturdy, somewhere in Chronicles.  The point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith of Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital beliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned - the Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church organization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the lived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one hopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies in the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading.  Following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I  would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the christian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing the nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into the christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading Graham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene's _Monsignor Quixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian, but such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly, I often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after reading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what being a Christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, in some way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us by the person of Jesus Christ.\",\"  A little supplement Basic Mike's info  :  For Sundday's opener on ABC, these are the announcing crews :  Devils/Isles at Pittsburgh - Gary Thorne(play-by-play),Bill Clement(color) and Al Morganti roaming the halls outside the dressing rooms.

If you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent.  However, if a professional thief wants your vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:  1) ignition kill or fuel cut-off 2) a flashing red LED  These two are basic to a decent alarm system.   To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock.

MUHAMMAD peace and blessings of Allah be upon him (SAW) is the last prophet of Islam.  He is the Prophet who is revealed the last Holy Scripture, Qur'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him) through the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets till the day of judgement as stated in the Qur'an by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between 571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW, is a treason against Islam, against Qur'an, against the message of Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another messenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah. He is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his coming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur'an is from  Chapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:   Muhammad is not the father of any of your men,  but (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal  of the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of  all things.  --------------------- Commentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed, it is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The  Holy Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers. Allah's teaching is and will always be continuous, but there has been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later ages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not an arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom, \\\"for Allah has full knowledge of all things.\\\"  ---------------------- DROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 2  A   D R O P L E T From The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur'an  Translations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of  Bediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i Noor  VOL 1, No 11, Part 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------       NINETEENTH LETTER       MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI  (A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)         (continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)     SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW) declared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a decree as the Glorious Qur'an and manifest miracles which number, according to the scholars, one thousand. The occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as certain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In fact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate unbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise Our'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His miracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids)  sorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their followers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the certainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars of Islam) to the hundreth degree.    The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of the universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the effect of the words,'You have indeed spoken the truth !'    Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler, while being observed by Him, 'The true ruler has appointed me to such and such position.  'At a time when you were asked to prove your claim, the word 'Yes' uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your request, this would confirm your claim even more soundly and more definitely than would the word 'Yes.'    In the same way, ALLAH's Most Noble Messenger claimed: 'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this universe.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken order at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my fingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five spigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He splits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear witness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at this food: although it is barely enough for two or three men, it satisfies two or three hundred.  'Further he shows hundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his prophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his deeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral conduct and manners, his character and appearance prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness. Indeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the famous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief merely by seeing him, and said, 'No lie can hide in this face, nor can any fraud be found in it!'    Although many of the  researchers have concluded that the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his miracles number about one thousand, there are thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of his prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of truth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of ways.    The Wise Our'an alone demonstrates thousands of the proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty aspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a phenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of individuals who claimed prophethood and performed miracles have lived and passed away; then, the prophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity superior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For whatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the means of the prophethood and messengership of all the messengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive fashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the person of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found in him with more certanity than all the other prophets. \",\" Christians through ages have had to learn to be patient.

What do you mean fair?  God is just, giving to everyone what they deserve. As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf Romans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole of the human race except Mary, have sinned.

On examining the power board, I noticed the largest capacitor with a very bad bulge at the top.  Naturally, I want to replace it, but I can't find any sources.  The electrolytic capacitor is 330 mF at 250WV.  It has radial leads, and is roughly 1 1/2 inches long, 1 1/8\\\" wide.  The dimensions are important since the whole board fits in a metal cage, leaving little room.

Suppose I analyze the output of this chip and I'm able to determine which bits are the encrypted packet which contains the serial number and session key.  Suppose I also design a simple algorithm based on this information which takes the data containing the encrypted session key and twiddles a bit (or several) before it's sent down the line.  Mind you, I'm sure the NSA thought of this along with a dozen other attacks I can't imagine, and the system is probably somehow designed so that manipulation of this information will cause a compliant receiving chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully.  But how? What if the two parties agree in advance on some kind of consistent bit-twiddling scheme, so the decryption chip sees the restored \\\"proper\\\" bitstream but an eavesdropper gets a E[K; UK] packet that's wrong?

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) rocket ship.          The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in mid-June.          Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for SSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60 million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a follow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies.          SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent changes in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO less of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as a step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.          SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies, said Col.  Simon \\\"Pete\\\" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program. \\\"I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I have available to spend,\\\" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell Douglas Astronautics headquarters.          While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital objective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the \\\"better, faster, cheaper\\\" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that \\\"leapfrog\\\" ahead of evolutionary technology developments.          Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a \\\"build a little, test a little\\\" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months -- showed how today's engineers could move beyond the \\\"miracles of our parents' time.\\\"          \\\"The key is management,\\\" Worden said. \\\"SDIO had a very light hand on this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.\\\"          Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be crucial. \\\"It's essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially.\\\"          SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. \\\"This is the direction we're going to have to go,\\\" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee's Democratic chairman. \\\"Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't sustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.\\\"          Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further. Joking that \\\"a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,\\\" Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency.          Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell Douglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. \\\"Let's not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!\\\"           Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.          McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its C-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment. \\\"On very large ventures, companies put in seed money,\\\" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas' senior vice president for space systems. \\\"You need strong government investments.\\\"          While the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas Aircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).          Flight tests this summer at White Sands will \\\"expand the envelope\\\" of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle take-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to 5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000 feet.          Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final tests will include a \\\"pitch-over\\\" manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.          The flight test series will be supervised by Charles \\\"Pete\\\" Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing. Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles aircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated check-out and access panels for easy maintainance.          If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will become a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the Pratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of thrust          Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on throttling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround.          Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union. The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\",\"Hi, I'm just getting into PoVRay and I was wondering if there is a graphic package that outputs .POV files.

This is different from claiming that they had ruled that it wasn't.   I'm not talking about plain shotguns in war -- I'm talking about short- barrelled (\\\"sawed-off\\\") shotguns in war.  Compare Revolutionary War blunderbusses; luparas in the Spanish-American  War; and trench-cleaners in WW I.  They were also put to good use by US soldiers in WW II, not to mention being invaluable to \\\"tunnel rats\\\"  in Vietnam, but, of course, \\\"Miller\\\" took place in 1939.   Here is my quandary:  you seem to be arguing that certain types of  guns fall outside the scope of the Second.  This isn't a useful argument  unless you believe that some significant gun or class of gun belongs in that class.    I think we both agree that zip guns probably aren't protected.  Maybe  we also both agree that all the weapons that random state governments  have been banning or trying to ban because they have \\\"no sporting purpose\\\"  and \\\"no provate citizen would ever need these guns\\\" DO fall under the  protection of the Second.    So, given that damn near any gun of any practical utility is or has at  some time been used by the military, even if only for marksmanship  training purposes, I need to understand why you are intent on pressing  this point, arguing that that SOMETHING is not protected by the Second.

This article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard Unix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com for a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can list it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the Usenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)  First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin, or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you have trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is probably not good enough.  Listserv:  There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which is available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably  look at listserv carefully.  The Alias file:  On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on whichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:  foo:   bar, baz, bletch   which means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is redistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest possible email list is   my-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address my-favorite-car-request: my-address  this has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can do the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:  my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list my-favorite-car-request: my-address  Where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory, owned by the list admin.  Bounced Mail:  this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating. Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup, by the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)   school-request:   welty school-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list school: \\\"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\\\" owner-school: school-request owner-school-out: school-request   here's what is going on here:  the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail coming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point of contact for administrative duties.  school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses, it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending the email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name; the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the actual list members.  the shell script i use is as follows:  ----------------- #!/bin/sh cd /tmp sed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \\\\         (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          cat -) | \\\\         /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\\                 -F \\\"The ${1} Mailing List\\\" ${1}-rebroadcast exit 0 -------------------  note that this script does not know the name of the list; the name is passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple lists (i run several out of this site.) the script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming message, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to: 99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request or owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.

Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA  series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set. Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a \\\"standby\\\" mode for use in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is still required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is relatively cheap.  Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance to stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin- stabilized control mode because it would require little power or  maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time to time.  In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money), but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.\",\" The first premise and the conclusion are not properly translated as identity statements, since the \\\"is\\\" in those statements is the \\\"is\\\" of predication rather than of identity.  Instead, they should be translated using a predicate letter.

The second premise appears to contain an \\\"is\\\" of identity, in which case it can be properly symbolized as j = g.  But your remark that \\\"Jesus is a subset of God\\\" suggests that strict identity is not desired here.

Remember, Koresh \\\"dried\\\" for your sins.  \",\" There is no easy answer to this question: it depends on whether the display device can hold pixmaps in off-screen memory, and if so, how efficiently the server manages these resources (having to deal with limited off-screen memory is the bane of the server implementor's existence!).    I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to  main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate, and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the F.B. followed by a write)  If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in CPU main memory, the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower, depending on your OS's implementation of shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window, which is also then just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device.  One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large, you don't end up growing the size of the server process to hold them.  One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that, in its sample implementation, there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., \\\"kill\\\").

Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by  performing studies that are \\\"blind\\\" in various ways.  Some of these are:    o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a       placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the      control group or the test group.    o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects       receive a placebo or the test treatment.    o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects      receive a placebo or the test treatment.  Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to  differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on which it is based so that others can verify it.

Luke's prolog is about the only thing we have from the author describing his process. The prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to do some investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally that say a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There are debates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly don't have the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of them seriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, and was written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die. One tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words may have been made earlier than the current Gospels.    In the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbal transmission of information.  I think many people would have preferred to hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe even from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather than from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a period when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do think there was some written material earlier, which was probably used as sources for the existing Gospels.  Establishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to confess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods used.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64 AD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the Century.

Any three of them must be non-collinear (otherwise all three could not lie on the surface of a sphere) and all four must not be coplaner (otherwise either they cannot all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them).  A, B and C define a circle. The perpendicular bisectors of AB, BC and CA  meet in a point (P, say) which is the centre of this circle. This circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere.  Consider the normal to the plane ABC passing through P. All points on this normal are equidistant from A, B and C and its circle (in fact it is a diameter of the desired sphere). Take the plane containing this normal and D (if D lies on the normal any plane containing the normal will do); this plane is at right angles to the ABC one.  Let E be the point (there are normally two of them) on the circumference of the ABC circle which lies in this plane. We need a point Q on the normal such that EQ = DQ. But the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of ED and the normal is such a point (and it exists since D is not in the plane ABC, and so ED is not at right angles to the normal).

Looks like you can squeeze speech into 4000bps if you have a fast enough computer like a sparcstation (or a Newton with the Acorn Risc Machine in it :-) )  This drops the bandwidth to so low a figure that it's feasible to run speech over tcp/ip running on top of slip down a v32bis modem.  Not only will this let us run point to point encrypted speech, it'll let us run speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us by getting *very* heavy about regulations.  The thought of this, if the administration realised, would probably scare them shitless.  Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol for internet speech *damn fast*, allowing anyone who feels brave to inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our workstations.  Shouldn't be too difficult.  The CELP stuff is standardised, we use tcp/ip streams, and a protocol allowing silences to be used to catch up on any net lag, and also to avoid sending any data during silences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end because any net delays would add up to big voice-lags)  As for me, I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone.

It does not go into great detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in general, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM. It is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It is posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining specifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.  CRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS ---------------------  - Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,   in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign   messages with your private key.    RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard   cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with   RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a   huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.  - Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,   since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow   an attacker to claim to be you.    DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be   compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies   have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each   message has a different DES key, the work for each message would   remain high.  KEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS ----------------------  - Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking   RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived   from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy   of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network   packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.    The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the   private key file across an untrusted link.  So don't do that.  Run    RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of   you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)   which nobody else has physical access to.  - Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could    allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him   rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your   intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with   the other bogus public key and pass them along.    It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.   The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent   has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be    given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key   authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is   not always practical.  Having other people \\\"vouch for you\\\" by   signing a statement containing your key is possible, although    RIPEM doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as   PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys   in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for   authentication.  PLAYBACK ATTACKS ----------------  - Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could   still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message   with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)   to Alice which says \\\"OK, let's do that.\\\" Your opponent intercepts   it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is   authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may   interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent   could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,   figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the   opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register    your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient   will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the   unknown message.    To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should    include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique   identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM   should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be   sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within   the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that   the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be   automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at   automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated   headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in   the utils directory.  LOCAL ATTACKS -------------  - Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of   the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under   UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,   although it would take some planning and effort to do something like   replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of   the plaintext, depending how it's stored.    In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is   an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine   which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an   eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your   passphrase.)    RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In   the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine,   which you have total control over and which nobody else has access   to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of   viruses, and so on.  However, there's a very real trade-off between   convenience and security here.    A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation   where other people have access (even root access), but increase   security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of   course) executable on a floppy disk.    Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing   in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their   own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the   security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since   you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you've just   given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and   install traps in your account to steal your private key next time   you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the   situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of   cleartext password authentication.    I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my   security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that   potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are   in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not   carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated   with greater care for critical correspondence.  UNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS -------------------------  - RIPEM's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key   corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the   traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she   may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There    exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an   ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by   you and readable by anyone, although RIPEM does not provide this   functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically   states that such transformations should be possible to allow   forwarding functions to work.\",\"I'm looking for brief information on new applications of electronics (or new electronics in applications.)

Damn.  I was afraid you would say that!   Well, perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be Lopez in there.  But they do have others worth playing, at least in *their* opinion.  And I happen to agree.   I can believe that.  I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word.  But Alomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above. That is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long as they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a consensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to give him that dreaded \\\"seasoning\\\".   Sorry.  New.  Don't know Nichols' Law.  Don't believe in catchers' era.  But I am interested in pitchers' eras with different catchers. Any info on that?   In other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind  a different decision than we would make must be financial.  I presume we feel this way about other franchises than Atlanta, no?   Well if it does make organizational sense, one can hardly fault them for their decisions.  I mean, please don't tell me how to run my business.  Especially when I'm being successful.   I'm sure you could be right.  You could also be smoking some illegal substance.  (Hey.  That's a joke.  Don't get offended.  Please.)  Well, I can't cite anyone's ethical rectitude because I don't know what it means.  :)  But again, if it makes organizational sense, then so be it.  Baseball is a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping Lopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do.  I happen to believe that it's a baseball decision.  While you from your armchair may disagee, I don't.  I think there is a lot of evidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among large guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I think it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have released one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It may also be logical.  I don't know what ethics have to do with it. Seems like pretty good common sense to me.  -- The Beastmaster  \",\"My girlfriend just started taking Imitrex for her migraine headaches.  Her neurologist diagnosed her as having depression and suffering from rebound headaches due to daily doses of analgesics.  She stopped taking all analgesics and caffine as of last Thursday (4/15).

Immediately after taking it, she has increased head pain for ten minutes, dizziness and mild nausea and mild chest pains.  A friend of hers mentioned that her doctor was wary of Imitrex because it had caused heart attacks in several people.  Apparently the mild chest pains were common in these other people prior to there attacks.  Is this just rumor?  Has anyone else heard of these symptoms?

Both the \\\"External Tank\\\" and \\\"Wingless Orbiter\\\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign options list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports that O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have been dropped, such as using the \\\"giant external fuel tanks used in launching space shuttles,\\\" and building a \\\"station around an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\\\"  Currently, there are three options being considered, as presented to the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in today's Times).  Option \\\"A\\\" - Low Cost Modular Approach This option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside, there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting the SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and Reston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective teams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this option are:   -  Uses \\\"Bus-1\\\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's      qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C      Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this      for the Air Force.   -  A \\\"Power Station Capability\\\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.      SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle      flies in an \\\"arrow mode\\\" to optimize the microgravity environment.      Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power      source for 30 day missions.   -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term      of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the      US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing      SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International      Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The      Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.      The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.   -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and      add another 20 kW of power   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,      the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return      Vehicle).  Option \\\"B\\\" - Space Station Freedom Derived The Option \\\"B\\\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin. This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we have all come to know and love :)  This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \\\"A\\\"). Also, the  number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit, for both options \\\"A\\\" and \\\"B\\\".  The build-up occurs in six phases:   -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power      is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when      it visits.   -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist      language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is      deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by      keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes      there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the      second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).   -  A \\\"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\\\" is achieved after 14 flights,      with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal      control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.   -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,      the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the      assembly in 24 flights.  Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option,  with the exception of the data management system, which has major changes.\",\"Anyone around here read this yet?

The most recent research  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State University  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns are  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by criminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in this  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when you  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because of  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding private  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study of  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39% of  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime because  they believed that the intended victim was  armed., and  57% agreed that \\\"most criminals are more worried  about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.\\\"2      One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the women  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation that  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in response  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This should be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando Florida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960's  the  female populace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just the  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and obtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for that  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to experience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally, a 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes showed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion rate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun, the completion rate drops to 3%.   1 G Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America Aldine de Gruyter, NY, 1991 2 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous:  A Survey of Felons and Their Firearms, Aldine de Gruyter, NY, 1986 -------  __________________________________________________________________________ [unlike cats] dogs NEVER scratch you when you wash them.

Keep  in mind that the 610 supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet. This lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the need for Nubus cards. And unless you're running FPU-intensive software, the 610 will blow the doors off the LCIII and the IIvx. The LCIII, on the other hand, is sufficient for most people and has a great price.  If you haven't guessed, I find halving the bus clock (the IIvx 32MHz uP vs. 16MHz bus) a throughly bad thing and I hope Apple never does it again. --  ______________________________________________________________________________\",\" The average amerikan today seems to think that the government should be able to eavesdrop on everyone (else).

That is, ignoring concerns about government intrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry, and their customers, to support this wiretap technology?    A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million dollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S. wiretaps led to 2057 arrests, while total police expenditures of $28 billion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].) I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately, but I'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology.

Put another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each police agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication to be wiretap compatible?  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps, or would they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes in other ways?\",\"Help !! - I'm looking for a ISA driver card and driver software for a Logical Devices Husky programmer (It aint mush good without these) can anyone help with either of these items ? cheers Mike. \",\" Sometimes I have a problem with doctor's prescribing medicine like this.

Subject: Introduction/Disclaimers   Although we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are not  electricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  If  you're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't  do it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,  or your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;  mistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.   Furthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National  Electrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).  To the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail  with the electrical code, but we don't quote sections  simply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong,  we invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!   The NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the  force of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,  however, do not.  Check your with your local building  department (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in  Canada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,  your local electrical utility may also have special requirements  for electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that  we say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family  residences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial  establishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different  rules.   Also note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in  some parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary  of the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.  Lots of things are the same, including voltages, line  frequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number  of crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've  noted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or  ``CEC''.   Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often  smart to go beyond their minimal requirements.  Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?   The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the  National Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.  It's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.  You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly  at 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the  full text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged  edition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.  And there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized  commentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the  recommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for  the abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --  US$65 plus shipping and handling.  Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?   The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up  of various government agencies, power utilities, insurance  companies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.  The CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two  or three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,  this standard and publishes a province-specific code book.  Since each province publishes its own slightly modified  standard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA  standard itself.  In this FAQ, \\\"CEC\\\" really means the  appropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is  derived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th  edition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th  edition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an  attempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.   The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical  inspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In  Ontario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't  overly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I  hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the  equivalent NEC publications.   Don't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout  the province.  Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?   In most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.  In some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical  inspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's  homes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do  wiring in \\\"commercial\\\" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)  are usually considered \\\"semi-commercial\\\" or \\\"commercial\\\".  However,  many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial  wiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can  find one willing to supervise.   If you do your own wiring, an important point:   Do it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better  job than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home,  and it's you or your family that might get killed if you make  a mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills  and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.  In this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that  are in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable,  and will impress the inspector.   The inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to  earn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your  time doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners.  Exceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely  picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.   Don't try to hide anything from the inspector.   Use the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip  wires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector  won't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it  takes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of  12ga wire through your hand that way.   Don't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C  or 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types  become very brittle.  Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?   First, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few  screwdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're   lucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved  devices) you need Robertson (\\\"square recess\\\") screwdrivers  (#1 and #2) instead of phillips.   For drilling a few holes, a 3/4\\\" or 1\\\" spade bit and 1/4\\\" or  3/8\\\" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or  are working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2\\\" drill  (right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and  3/4\\\" or 1\\\" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull  you through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even  in 90 year old hardwood timbers.   Screw-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you  install your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws  work well).    For stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or  ordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart \\\"combo stripper,  crimper and bottle opener\\\" types.  You should expect to pay  $15 to $20 for a good \\\"plier-type\\\" pair.  It will have sized  stripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should  be easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the  blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There  are fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't  necessary, and pros usually don't use them.   A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends  in constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.   You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.   You should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling  inside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire  loops with a \\\"loop former hole\\\" on your wire stripper - more  accurate.   If you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for  removing the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the  end of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,  and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a  \\\"zipper\\\", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip  the sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to  slash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley  utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)  can be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility  that you'll gouge the conductors.   For any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well  worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).  Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire  or the insulation.   Three-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired  outlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more  expensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple  voltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated  wire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost  about US$ 10 at Radio Shack.   You should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are  dead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)  and work well.  If you get more serious, a \\\"audible alarm\\\" type is  good for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known  to lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)   For running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.  Often, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or  a length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.   Electrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent  wiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for  wrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap   around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination  screws - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to  prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet  that has no cover plate).  Subject: What is UL listing?   The UL stands for \\\"Underwriters Laboratory\\\".  It used to be  an Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent  and non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment  for potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means  that the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements  for safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily  mean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just  that it probably won't kill you.   The UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are  permitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,  insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will  limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to  the failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in  many situations the NEC will require that a wiring component  used for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.  Indirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring  must be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or  occupancy permits issued.   Subject: What is CSA approval?   Every electrical device or component must be certified by the  Canadian Standards Association before it can be sold in  Canada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done  with CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to  the UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is  required by law.   Again, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved  equipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the  claim.   In Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC  (UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to  be more a liason group between the CSA and insurance  companies.  Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?   USA: The following three books were suggested by our readers       Residential Wiring      by Jeff Markell,      Craftsman Books,      Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.       Practical Electrical Wiring      Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National      Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70      Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan      McGraw-Hill Book Co.       Wiring Simplified      H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan      Park Publishing Co.    Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC  revision.  Which is currently 1990.   Canada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called  \\\"Electrical Code Simplified\\\".  There appears to be a version  published specific to each province, and is very tied into the  appropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,  and is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get  this book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer  questions on the net ;-).   It is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is  available at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.  Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?   Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and  inspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more  mundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not  liking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections  provides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors  or subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose  their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.   Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your  home, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a  permit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about  this.   If fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at  fault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage  claims.   In general, the process goes like this:   - you apply to your local inspections office or building     department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or     detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is     a good time to ask questions on any things you're not     sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose     special conditions on you, require loading     calculations and ask other questions.  At this point     they will tell you which inspections you will need.   - If you're installing a main panel, you will need to     have the panel and service connections inspected     before your power utility will provide a connection.     This is sometimes done by the local power authority     rather than the usual inspectors.   - After installing the boxes and wiring, but before     the insulation/walls go up, you will need a     \\\"rough-in\\\" inspection.   - After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,     you will need a \\\"final inspection\\\".  Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations.  Do I have to upgrade?   In general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,  though there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some  cases).  However, any new work must be done according to the  latest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you  may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all  of your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.  Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240   One thing where things might get a bit confusing is the  different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of  a circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V  or another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same  thing...  In North America the utility companies are required  to supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.  This works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there  are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not  unreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped  to 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially  at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number  of reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,  different people choose call them by slightly different numbers.  This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them \\\"110V\\\" and  \\\"220V\\\", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will  be.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.   One thing that might make this a little more understandable  is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V  instead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device  is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that  low.   208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between  phases of a 3-phase \\\"Y\\\" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any  hot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase \\\"Y\\\"  circuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.   In keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended  to run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...  Subject: What does an electrical service look like?   There are logically four wires involved with supplying the  main panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility  pole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.    The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded   into the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes   to the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where  the main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic  action conductivity \\\"breaks\\\" (often between copper and iron pipe)).  This is the \\\"grounding conductor\\\".  It is there to make sure that  the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire  normally carries no current.   One of the other wires will be white (or black with white or  yellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.  It is connected to the \\\"centre tap\\\" (CEC; \\\"center tap\\\" in the  NEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It  is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often  inside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected  anywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.   Furthermore, there should only be one grounding system in  a home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.  These will be connected together, or connected to the neutral  at a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional  grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house  wiring is unsafe and contrary to code.   If you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually  brought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are  not connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one  neutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations   (certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do  have to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your  inspector.   The other two wires will usually be black, and are the \\\"hot\\\"  wires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as  well.   The two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each  other.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,  the voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the  white and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.   Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.  This is either because the neutral and ground are connected  together at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one  wire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some  rare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only  service).  Subject: What is a circuit?   Inside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.  These connections are then used to supply power to selected  portions of the home.  There are three different combinations:   1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.   2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.   3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,      and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.   (1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and  lighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying  power to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they  often have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several  circuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is  usually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or  air conditioners.   [Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar  to (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there  are two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral  and ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing  the neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead  of four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.  When connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles  are required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but  the NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,  and found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to  local practice -- there are restrictions on when this is  permissible.]   (1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,  white for neutral, and bare for grounding.   (2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a  bare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.   You will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground  wire.  Since the white is \\\"hot\\\" in this case, both the NEC and CEC  requires that the white wire be \\\"permanently marked\\\" at the ends  to indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail  polish or sometimes electrical tape.   Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the  panel through a circuit breaker or fuse.   There are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)  or (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places  require this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is \\\"frame ground\\\",  the other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an  alternative to GFCI protection.  Subject: \\\"grounding\\\" versus \\\"grounded\\\" versus \\\"neutral\\\".   According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the  \\\"grounding\\\" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green  or bare wire.  The word \\\"neutral\\\" is reserved for the white when  you have a circuit with more than one \\\"hot\\\" wire.  Since the white  wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the  panel, the proper term is \\\"grounded conductor\\\".  However, the  potential confusion between \\\"grounded conductor\\\" and \\\"grounding  conductor\\\" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should  never use the bare wire as a \\\"grounded conductor\\\" or white wire  as the \\\"grounding conductor\\\", even though they are connected  together in the panel.   [But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground  separately from the main panel.  Usually.]   In the trade, and in common usage, the word \\\"neutral\\\" is used  for \\\"grounded conductor\\\".  This FAQ uses \\\"neutral\\\" simply to  avoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use \\\"neutral\\\"  too.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light  switch applications) neutral.  Not ground.  Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?   Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power  to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For  example, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should  \\\"trip\\\", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As  such, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the  wiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the  equipment itself won't cause a fire.   Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt  (safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby  interrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively  fast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have  large startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use  a \\\"time-delay\\\" fuse (one brand is \\\"fusetron\\\") which will avoid  tripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a  spring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be  replaced.   Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They  usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched  into position against another contact.  When the current flow  through the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip  heats up and bends.  By bending it \\\"trips\\\" the latch, and the  spring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave  similarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to  trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high  overloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite  number of times - each time they trip, or are thrown  when the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which  damages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in  place of switches unless they are specially listed for the  purpose.   Neither fuses nor breakers \\\"limit\\\" the current per se.  A dead  short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even  thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which  can often cause severe damage.  Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?   Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher  risk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually  due to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts  corroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse  being installed, or the proverbial \\\"replace the fuse with a  penny\\\" trick.   Since breakers are more permanently installed, and have better  connection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.   Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When  a fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting  path.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,  melted service wiring, through fires in the electrical  distribution transformer and having your house burn down.  Breakers don't do this.   Many jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit  fuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new  fuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special  inserts to \\\"key\\\" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)   Some devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse  protection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse  is there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the  labeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently  installed motors.  The installation instructions will tell you  if you need one.  Subject: What size wire should I use?   For a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,  you can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,  though, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid  voltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than  14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.   Here's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for  more than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or  ganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate  heat easily:    Gauge  Amps   14  15   12  20   10  30   8  40   6  65    We don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent  on the application and precise wire type.  Subject: Where do these numbers come from?   There are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.  The smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When  the resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is  more voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need  higher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in  conduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long  runs.   Neither effect is very significant over very short distances.  There are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller  wire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most  lamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits  one of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger  wire.  Subject: What does \\\"14-2\\\" mean?   This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors  in a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second  the number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but  remember there's usually an extra ground wire.  \\\"14-2\\\" means  14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.   -2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes  the white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In  the latter case, the sheath is usually red too.   -3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.  Usually carrying 220V with neutral.  Subject: What is a \\\"wirenut\\\"/\\\"marrette\\\"/\\\"marr connector\\\"?  How are they  used?   A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used  to connect wires together.  \\\"Marrette\\\" or \\\"Marr connector\\\"  are trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.   In essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them  together, then twist the wirenut on.   Though some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the  wire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically  secure.   There are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check  that the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the  quantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.   Don't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or  your fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (\\\"linesman\\\") pliers,  and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes  it's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it  goes in the wirenut properly.   Some people wrap the \\\"open\\\" end of the wirenut with electrical  tape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may  tear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because  a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead  of taping it, the connection should be redone.  Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?   A GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures  the current current flowing through the hot wire and the  neutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the  presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other  path.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of  an appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any  of these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking  the circuit.   GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,  for example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral  leads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI  wouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot  lead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the  GFCI happy.   The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.  One is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed  *must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be  protected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices  downstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be  covered by a single GFCI outlet.  Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?   The NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase  outlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages,  unfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or  just about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water  or dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,  those dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'',  typically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and  laundry appliances.   The CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there  is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or  basement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you  have a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to  outside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.   Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may  want to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI  breaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI  outlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in  Canada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your  finished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?  Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does  water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?  Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?   GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a  safety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run  unattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,  and sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs  are sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that  the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary  current imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most  GFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no  apparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring  before deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.  Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?   For most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the  first device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with  a built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI  breakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE  breaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one  major exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch  circuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),  such as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a  multi-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;  the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on  what brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such  a circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.   One more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use  an oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use  large (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.   Incidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one  specific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't  really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first  outlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet  in the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But  protecting the whole circuit is preferred.   When you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little  \\\"ground fault protected\\\" stickers that come with it and mark  the outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which  outlets are \\\"downstream\\\", simply by tripping the GFCI with the  test button and see which outlets are dead.  Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?   Apart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on,  and for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without  a good ground connection), they're intended to guard against  insulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of  the appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an  insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the  ground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly  trips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not  grounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if  you touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of  course, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very  tiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace  ungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).   There are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In  particular, that applies to toasters and anything else with  exposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating  electrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will  happen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock;  the resistance will be too high.  But if the case were  grounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to  ground...  Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization   Nowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the  other.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)  on one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.  This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the  the shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to  have an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).   Most 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.   This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right  way around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the  narrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the  hot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.  If not, you can usually figure out which is which by which  prong the terminating screw connects to.  Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?   The NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance  circuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex  receptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more  than 24\\\" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider  than 12\\\" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.  The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except  in the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits  are in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,  lighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be  protected by a GFCI (NEC only).   Split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab  is broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to  the upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.  The neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When  \\\"carrying through\\\" to another outlet, the neutral must be  pigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral  connection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect  from downstream outlets.  Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?   There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to  the sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in  the light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.  Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?   Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.  Sometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.  This is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside  stud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject  to mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are  wired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several  different categories of NM cable.   BX cable -- technically known as armored cable or \\\"AC\\\" has a  flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is  fairly resistant to damage.   TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic  sheath.    Protection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable  is run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer  surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25\\\" (CEC & NEC)  from the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected  from mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of  metal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.   [Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored  cable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,  but this is technically illegal.]   Additional protection recommendations (these are rules in the  Canadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague  references to \\\"exposed to mechanical damage\\\" in both the NEC  and CEC):       - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage        where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls        in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.        Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.      - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces        or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian        practise is usually to install a junction or outlet        box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable        or NM cable in flexible conduit to \\\"jump\\\" to the appliance.        Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.      - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating        ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by        means of a 25mm/1\\\" air space, or suitable insulation        material (a wad of fiberglass).      - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box        or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'.        Holes in joists or studs are considered \\\"supports\\\".        Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to        each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,        it is permitted where \\\"proper\\\" support is impractical]      - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.        [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring        to the \\\"workmanship\\\" clause, but this seems more honoured        in the breach...]      - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or        similar finish.      - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.      - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists        or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more        than 1m (39\\\").   Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small  plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to  prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through  the insulation.   BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by  solid wall coverings.   In places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of  a garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a  UL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of  fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the  wire.   Service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.   In damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will  need special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like  very heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of  conduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground  wiring section.]    Thermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be   exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that   purpose.   Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through  furnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed  by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this  is that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses  from burning insulation very rapidly through the building.  Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.     Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,   except that Canadian wire designations usually include the   temperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: \\\"AC90\\\" versus \\\"AC\\\".  In the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.   NOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes  most often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.  There are very different requirements for mobile homes.  Check your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything  that's the slightest out of the ordinary.

The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable  only.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box  itself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic  boxes don't use metal cable clamps.   The CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable  armor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still  provide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also  requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.   The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for  non-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground  connection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other  hand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For  exposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.  Subject: Junction box positioning?   A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.   Junction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible  later.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction  boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may  get nasty.  Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?   In general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few  caveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage  rating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half  a dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire  back to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle  constraints as well.  For example, older house  wiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess  heat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the  insulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.  Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high  temperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your  ceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case  replacing any devices is a real adventure.)   Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some  fluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and  its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy  chandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box  specifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling  joists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available  that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and  mounted between the joists.   There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as  \\\"pot\\\" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated  ceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.  The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated  ceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a \\\"coffin\\\" (usually  8'x16\\\"x12\\\" - made by making a pair of joists 12\\\" high, and covering  with plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet*  long)   NEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3\\\"  clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.  The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,  which means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile.  Presumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't  actually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector  requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get  accidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown  in later.]   There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and  fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are  usually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat  more expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should  ensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.  Follow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location  for the sensor can vary.   There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved  for use in insulation.  The \\\"coffin\\\" appears the only legal approach.  Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?   This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is  loose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up  being more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with  respect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can  destroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in  some situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions  require the stove frame connected to neutral).   If this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately  and have them come and check out the problem.   Note: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with  lighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A  loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness  far longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.  Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?   Three phase power has three \\\"hot\\\" wires, 120 degrees out of  phase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors  because it is more \\\"efficient\\\", provides a bit more starting torque,  and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.   You're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows  110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between  any two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal  220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the  two hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.   Bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually  ridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you  want to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to  buy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is  possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have  a \\\"capacitor start\\\" unit, or use a larger motor as a  (auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if  the motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to  replace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an  article on how to do this if you must.   Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using  such a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.  Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?   Theoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there  is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply  wiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times  less power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also  means that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor  will get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the  smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.   This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more  than 50 feet long.  Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?   It is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746  watts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,  it is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200  watts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,  so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational  efficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.   Some equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router  manufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far  in excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a \\\"stall  horsepower\\\" or similar.  That means the power is measured when  the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.  What they don't mention is that if you kept it in that  condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker  will trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far  more current than it can continuously.   When comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This  should be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure,  check the amperage rating, which is always present.  Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?   Older homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead  of the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety  ground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither  the NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.   There are several different approaches to solving this:      1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the         conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect         the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle         box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.      2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and         it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can         run a conductor to it from the third prong.      3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.      4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug         should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI         protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI         will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong         outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,         the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it         wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault         could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected         to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't         indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath         on BX cable.   The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three  prong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.  Like caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.  Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?  Should the test button work?   We're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,  that your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's  a resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE  side of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current  through this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.  This is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require  a real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press  the TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:  if the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially  dangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.   The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground  wire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The  causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the  formalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never  tested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,  UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device  behaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded  outlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are  labeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician  was surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require  it, and promised to investigate.)  Subject: How should I wire my shop?   As with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all  devices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies  that you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the  circuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for  the major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or  shop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have  big motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp  breakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles  which means you'd have to \\\"replug\\\" all your equipment.  Lights  should either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared  with circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two  separate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a  situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand  RPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.   Do install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the  beginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable.  It's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each  point, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same  time as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and  plates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have  objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit  wrong.   Note that some jurisdictions have a \\\"no horizontal wiring\\\"  rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used  for working.  What this means is that all wiring must be  run along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.   Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V  circuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.  Don't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you  can help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled  extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of  the same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much  heat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)   If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,  you should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop  wiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to  equip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.  If you want to install individual switches to ``safe''  particular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.  For example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to  handle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy  ``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.   Finally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished  basements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And  even if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop  outlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might  have a different idea.   Note: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop  wiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.  Subject: Underground Wiring   You will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use  special wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic  tubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots  thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion  of lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is  generally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically  listed for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,  fittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion  in water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And  of course, don't forget the GFCIs.   The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to  jurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about  your specific situation.   A hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says \\\"buried power  line\\\" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.  Subject: Aluminum wiring   During the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became  quite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,  aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,  and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.  We recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new  wiring.   But don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum  wiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.  Aluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper  installation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential  problems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.   The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as  \\\"cold creep\\\".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When  it cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes  through a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each  time.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes  when in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance  of the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/  oxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,  melt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even  cause a fire.   Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move  into a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of  safe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing  a home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you  hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring  for the following things:       1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to         aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will         be stamped with \\\"Al/Cu\\\" or \\\"CO/ALR\\\".  The latter supersedes         the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat         more expensive than the ordinary ones.       2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around         the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be         tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the         problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug         up each connection.          Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the         main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.       3) \\\"push-in\\\" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.         Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with         the proper screw connections immediately.       4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,         melted insulation, or \\\"baked\\\" fixtures.  Any such damage should         be repaired.            5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be         handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the         wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting         aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be         connected together using special crimp devices, with an         anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter         are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless         you can rent the tool.       6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring         by means of a short copper \\\"pigtail\\\".  See (5) above.            7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped         (not nicked) wire etc.       If, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring  shows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider  the wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,  we suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,  you can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having  this professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.  You can do this yourself too.  Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?   Congratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire  an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.  Not just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an  inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor  ones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any  minor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many  places, we suggest you look elsewhere.   Here's some hints on what to look for:   Obvious non-code wiring can include:    - Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls   - Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without     proper marking.   - Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of     a GFCI)   - Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)   - Switched neutrals   - Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines   Certain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one  time) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:    - Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps      not properly terminated wiring)   - A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are     separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when     it's *really* convenient ;-)   - Switches and outlets in bizarre locations   - Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps   - Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them   - Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or     ceiling   - Backwrapped grounding wires  Subject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring    In the years since Edison \\\"invented\\\" electricity, several different  wiring \\\"styles\\\" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you  may encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old   methods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.   The oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called  \\\"knob and tube\\\" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with  a cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural  members (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).  Wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections  were made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping  with tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,  the wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs  down the centre of each room, with \\\"taps\\\" off to each fixture.  The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some  cases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same  colour as the hot wires.   You'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.   Comments on K&T:    - the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about     electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.   - The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up     very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in     quite good condition.   - No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.   - boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with     GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,     so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.   - Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between     separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to     overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on     any circuit.   - Building code does not permit insulation in walls     that contain K&T.   - Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be     tricky.  Consult your inspector.   - Modern wiring practise requires considerably more     outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.    Since K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't  necessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should  watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and  be cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly  reasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on  new circuits using modern techniques.    After K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type  you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks  much like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was  used in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor.  It was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback  is that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole  systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at  a touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.   This stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if  the wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as  much as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.  A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several  hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink  tubing.   After this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.  It's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.  This stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard  and is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be  replaced - it should be considered as safe as the \\\"modern\\\" stuff -  thermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.  Subject: Where do I buy stuff?   Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their  prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or  DIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety  including the \\\"odd\\\" stuff, and have people behind the counter that  know what you're talking about.

Windows will use a swap file larger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft Windows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information that the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book they handed out they have a section on \\\"Creating larger than recommended swapfile\\\".  I'll quote the information    If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you   will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything   larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we   will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount   of RAM on your machine.  So as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You probably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only telling you what little he knew.  Be that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the opportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren't actually incredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and optimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer you HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pick up Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130. That is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.  You could also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself I sprang for Word.  Well, hope that was helpful to someone.  And besides that I hope someone will go to a workshop and save a little money.  And if anyone at Microsoft is reading this -- I really love your products.

If not us who??   Is that so? or you were taking advantage of weakness of ottoman empire to grab some land. As soon as you got green lights from allied forces, you occupied Izmir and other cities in western Turkey. You killed and  raped millions people without any reason. Of course, you paid the price. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk made you swim in aegean sea but not far enough. Your aggressions thru Turkey at anytime in the past did not get you any reward and shall not get you anywhere.   **Compromise on what, the invasion of Cyprus, the involment of Turkey in **Greek politics, the refusal of Turkey to accept 12 miles of territorial **waters as stated by international law, the properties of the Greeks of **Konstantinople, the ownership of the islands in the Greek lake,sorry, Aegean.   What compromise are you talking about on Cyprus. That is not Greece business to join the island to Greece. That is up to people in the island to live or not to live together. They made their decision and they are living  separetely now.There is a peace there. Greeks can't slaughter Turks anymore because turkish peacemaking force is there. Your dream will never come true. 12 mile territorialwater!!!! Are you joking or dreaming? We can declare our 12 miles territorial water which can come close to Athens. How would you like it? If you have any guts why don't you shoot at some Turkish ships in your dream 12 mile territorial waters? We do not have any city called Konstantinople. We have a city called ISTANBUL!!!! All the greeks in Istanbul are being treated just any other Turks. There is no difference among people in Turkey. You look at your own backyard first before talking about human rights in Turkey. What are the rights of Turks in Greece? Nothing. They do not even have basic human rights like right to have property, fredom of religion, fredom of press, fredom of vote elect their community leaders. Government of Greece publicly encourages people to destroy and burn schools, religious places, houses, and farms belong to turkish minority. Then, Greek government forces these minorities to go to Turkey without anything with them. You will dream to see Aegean sea as Greek lake but it will never happen. Think about the war between Turkey and Greece in 1915. The river called SAKARYA flood 21 days filled with blood in 1915.    **Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment **directly or indirecly is a \\\"bad\\\" person. **It is not your nationality that makes you bad, it is your support **of the actions of your goverment that make you \\\"bad\\\". **People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you **are. You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and **as a such you must pay the price.   You mean that any person who supports the actions and policies of the government of Greece is a good person. That is your Greek idea to say Turks are bad people. We know who we are and proud to be TURKS anywhere in the world. That is not Greeks business to tell us what kind of people we are. You are not at position to judge people because you are not civilized enough to give equal rights to your own minorities. Millions of minorities are being treated as third class citizen, their rights are taken away from them, and they have no voices under the Government of Greece. They are almost being treated as slaves even though we are getting into 21th century. Therefore, do not make me laught at you.    **You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks.Just **as Greeks, Arats, Slavs, Kurds and all other people who had **the luck to be under Turkish occupation. **They will talk to you about murders,rapes,distruction. **You do not learn about Turks from history books, you learn about **them from people who experienced first hand Turkish friendliness.  The Government of Greece is actively supporting terrorism against Turkey.Armenian and Kurdish terrorists have headquarters in Athens. They are being trained in special camps in Greece. They are taught how to kill innocent women and children.This not a claim, this is a fact known by whole world. In conlusion, you are in action to murder, rape, destroy the innocent people. I do not take you seriously because you are not at any positions to talk about human rights and dignity. Your own government, the Government of Greece actively supports atrocities in Bosnia. Serbs's Barbarism pleases your government. Please Napoleon think twice before you write anything about Turks and Turkey. You are the worst in human right conditions and treatment of the minorities. Who wants to be a fried with someone whose government does not respect the human rights, supports terrorism in Turkey,barbaric actions in Bosnia, treats Turkish minorities as third class citizen and take away all of their rights, treating them as slaves at the beginning of 21th century???????

They sent it overnight (very nice) and I got it installed, and we found that it didn't work properly. When you put the computer in  thousands mode, the bottom of the screen (using the new chip) is all flickering and fuzzy. So I called them up and I'm going to return it for a new one.  My question is, how often does such a thing happen with SIMM chips in general? Do you often find when ordering chips that a large portion are bad? Is this a rarity? This is the first chip I've ordered so I have no other experience in this area. I'm just curious if anyone else has had the same type of experience.  That's about it.

Wouldn't it just make more sense to find some way to cut down on the cost of malpractice insurance?  And maybe that's not such a good thing. I also read somewhere that it is next to impossible in Canada to litigate against the health system-class action suits are nearly impossible, and you can't sue the provincial health officials at all.   Oh no. Don't let the AMA know about this. They have enough power as it is. Ask most Americans whether they'd like the doctors' lobby to get more powerful.   Well, yeah, tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre outside Ottawa. Theoretically it's limited to service personnel, but some studies I've heard about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not only have connections but aren't \\\"urgent\\\" at all.  The problem is, in a system where hospitals' annual budgets are approved by the government, how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions? I bet that if you're an MP or MPP, or good friends with one, you're put on any hospital's \\\"urgent\\\" care list no matter how minor your problem. Which is OK  unless you're someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot.   Hmm. How much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of GNP spent on health care if dentistry and optometry were included in the accounting?  Maybe Canada spends proportionately just as much on health care as we do.   So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse. Bob Rae, the second least popular man in Ontario, warned Ontarians a few years ago that if they didn't stop cross-border shopping in such huge numbers, \\\"the services they expect from the province just won't be there in a few years\\\" (Fortunately for them (and less fortunately for the retailers here in Western New York) the  Canadian dollar went back to a more realistic value). He didn't say so, but I knew he meant the OHIP. What would happen if his warning turned out to be the  truth? Would the private insurers take up the slack? They'd be under no  obligation to. Of course, they could eventually make money again, but if what you say is true, they'd be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling  such basic services, too).   Would that it were free. Americans would start another revolution if they had to pay taxes at Canadian rates. \",\" Who knows in this legal climate, but there is tremendous legal precendent for forcibly quarantining TB patients in sanitariums.  100 yrs ago it was done all the time.

As I pointed out, I recently checked several Lexicons:   \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Louw and Nida  \\\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\\\"  \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Grimm  \\\"Word study Concordance,\\\" Tynsdale  \\\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other    early Christian Writings,\\\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich  \\\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\\\" Perschbacher  A couple simply stated \\\"hanged oneself\\\", and a couple were more explicit  and stated that \\\"apacgw\\\" means specifically \\\"kill yourself by hanging.\\\" A couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \\\"apacgw\\\" is \\\"strangle, throttle or choke\\\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best references though, \\\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the literal translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give further context).    The word \\\"apagchw\\\" has two root words: \\\"gchw\\\" is the \\\"to strangle\\\" root, and the root word \\\"apo\\\" means literally \\\"away.\\\" This root words is included in words which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the greek word \\\"apagello\\\" means to send a message).  \\\"Apo\\\" can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson specifically makes comparison to the word \\\"apokteiuo,\\\" which means \\\"to kill.\\\" In literal meaning the word \\\"apacgw\\\" means \\\"to throttle, strangle to put out of the way,\\\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from life, to death).  So while the word \\\"apacgw\\\" does mean \\\"to hang,\\\" it specifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he state that it means \\\"to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging.\\\" He then notes the the use of \\\"apacgw\\\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He presents that example of \\\"apacgw\\\" as being used to explicitly mean \\\"suicide by hanging.\\\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the added denotation of \\\"death,\\\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by God, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete meaning of \\\"apacgw\\\" (ie: Since the word \\\"apacgw\\\" was used, then death is denoted as the result).   By the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \\\"apacgw\\\":   Note Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to Greek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\\\" the the Hebrew say \\\"and died\\\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek.  It should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \\\"and died\\\", the correct translation would still be \\\"apacgw,\\\" as the man did indeed die from strangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions which contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily executed by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove your point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing \\\"apacgw\\\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence.   Now I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus, I think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above what the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or historical source to justify it.   By the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:   Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that there are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two thousand years ago (after all, things change).   Now as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same as the 30 silvers:   True, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas' betrayal \\\"an iniquity,\\\" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas' actions \\\"an iniquity\\\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took      \\\"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling      him \\\"Buy what we need for the feast\\\"; or that he should give something      to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and      it was night.\\\"  Note that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money box.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by the author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived.   Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen evidence that \\\"apacgw\\\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie: Passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself the next day.  Thus the money which bought the \\\"Field of Blood\\\" would have to have been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver that night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, I believe that the house of cards is comming down).   Maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.  By the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: the mention of it in Matthew), you say:   I am reminding you now to discuss it now. It's all part of the same verse we are discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping  these issues.

If the gift of tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone, no matter what languages they know, there would be no need for the gift of interpretation, and I Corinthians 14 would not have had to have been written.     That's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million Christians world wide.  Sure, there are some who want glory for themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those who do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthian church also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.   I would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges  do so more often in private prayer than in public.  Link Hudson\",\"an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy.  it switches to \\\"sport\\\" mode when the electronics figure it,  not when the driver sets the switch.. which is the proper way to do it, IMO.  so what does \\\"sport\\\" mode entail?  several things:  1) revving to red line (or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy)  2) delayed upshifts.  (i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the  low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and  would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's  another curve approaching)  3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is  depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern  electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.  this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about  to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as  little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.  also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a 5 speed)?    how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear, low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight. \",\"Probably within 50 years, a new type of eugenics will be possible.

Well, who cares.  First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the Clipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:  The chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs general encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB ECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm consists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data seems to be 64 Bit? Yes. So if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when  Clipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key.  (Or is it one key per direction ?) They can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however. Somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip which is now ready to work. The clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits. These 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number with 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip) At beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??) before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper chip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number, and the session key. This might look like X{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number} where X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key. This family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???) After that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet being encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.  Denning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160 Bit's.  Now, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not being an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this scheme, which might be exploited by several parties.  As far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the  obvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing the serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources for the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.  Then, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security could (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits each, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply assume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or law enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on and so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding chip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ]. How about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that the police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode this session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this after the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution, but I guess politics will not work that way.  Apparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes of intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter- cept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes the right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea who is allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi- cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company to the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far as I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching- company, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key will not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable by anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!  What do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session key would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be so difficult to do *that* :^)  And now a last point, for the other side. After all I have read and heard about Clipper (not the programming language for dBase, is it ? [:-)]) it seems to have many advantages, which shold not be overseen!

CRYPTO '93  -  General Information  (August 22 - 26, 1993) ............................................................................  THE PROGRAM:  Crypto'93 is the thirteenth in a series of workshops on  cryptology held at Santa Barbara, and is sponsored by the International  Association for Cryptologic Research, in cooperation with the IEEE  Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, the Computer  Science Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and  Bell-Northern Research (a subsidiary of Northern Telecom). The program  for the workshop will cover all aspects of cryptology. Extended abstracts of  the papers presented at the conference will be distributed to all attendees  at the conference, and formal proceedings will be published at a later date.  In addition to the regular program of papers selected or invited by the  program committee, there will be a rump session on Tuesday evening for  informal presentations. Facilities will also be provided for attendees to  demonstrate hardware, software and other items of cryptographic interest.  If you wish to demonstrate such items, you are urged to contact the General  Chair so that your needs will be attended to. The social program will include  hosted cocktail parties on Sunday and Monday. In addition, there will be a  beach barbecue on Wednesday evening. The price of the barbecue is included  in the room and board charge, and extra tickets may be purchased.  ABOUT THE CONFERENCE FACILITIES:  The workshop will be held on the campus of  the University of California, Santa Barbara. The campus is located adjacent  to the Santa Barbara airport and the Pacific Ocean. Accommodations are  available in the university dormitories at relatively low cost for conference  participants. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to stay in the  dormitories, so those bringing small children will need to make separate  arrangements in one of several nearby hotels. More information on hotels is  enclosed. Parking on campus is available at no cost to the participants.  However, participants must indicate on the registration form if they desire  a parking permit.  TRAVEL INFORMATION:  The campus is located approximately 2 miles from the  Santa Barbara airport, which is served by several airlines, including  American, America West, Delta, United, and US Air. Free shuttle bus service  will be provided between the Santa Barbara airport and the campus on Sunday  and Thursday afternoons. All major rental car agencies are also represented  in Santa Barbara, and AMTRAK has rail connections to San Francisco from the  north and Los Angeles from the south. Santa Barbara is approximately 100 miles  north of Los Angeles airport, and 350 miles south of San Francisco.  REGISTRATION:  Participation is invited by interested parties, but attendance  at the workshop is limited, and pre-registration is strongly advised. Late  registrations, subject to a late registration fee, may be accepted if space  is available, but there are NO GUARANTEES. To register, fill out the attached  registration form and return to the address on the form along with payment in  full before July 9, 1993. Campus accommodations will be available on a first  come, first serve basis for attendees who register by July 9, 1993. The  conference fees include participation in the program and all social functions,  as well as membership to the IACR and a subscription to the Journal of  Cryptology. The room and board charges include dormitory lodging and meals  are available to those unable to obtain funding. Applications for stipends  should be sent to the General Chair before June 4, 1993.  ............................................................................

I see...  :-)   You can believe that if you wish.  It is undeniable, however, that people  have left the compound unharmed and alive earier in the standoff.  And since their leader was preaching that they would have an apocalypse, you  can not say undeniably that there wouldn't have been a mass suicide if the  FBI had simply stayed outside and waited another 51 days.   I am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense. You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this  compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless  to me.  I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't  stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me  sad and sick.   Have you ever heard of Jonestown? The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority  worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these  people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot  more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as  last year.   By all means, the FBI should be investigated, too.   BTW, I thought the second ammendment was God.  :-)   \",\"ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY!!!    This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary,  ether sucking structures, AND why we observe \\\"orbital\\\" motion!!    Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic  waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the  Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago.     I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact  that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the  earth's surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption  that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)    The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the  development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications  of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!    REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!     1   I dream like this: ether based reality     The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations  start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices both drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it,  converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy.  (non-spinning lattice = \\\"dark matter\\\")    The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image  of a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us  being stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by  the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is  spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner  kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a  faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground  of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but  its \\\"foot print\\\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])      The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self  spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is  itself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the  wobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The \\\"orbit\\\" of the earth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around by the sun's ether feild.    The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \\\"distance\\\"  apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because  the \\\"path\\\" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like  sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half  turn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has  got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to  the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \\\"j\\\" hook at  the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the  whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there.     With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon  can be about as big as \\\"earth's\\\" shadow upon it, and at other times  totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge,  would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they  look about the same size?     O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S  E       /     \\\\                 M    |      |      OR                M              \\\\ _ _ /                                 S                                      The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate of ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating \\\"turntable view\\\"  of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a  half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the  day. Try and draw that \\\"earth shadow.\\\") Its only the moon's image  which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is  the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away  from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.    \\\"Light-Years\\\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is  closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase  of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion.  (defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be  essentially happening now. The \\\"piece\\\" of light may have experienced  many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.    To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to  de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design  a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like  trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)    To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd  look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just  might carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the  spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+  billion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG  backwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card  for Pentium!)    Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound  media, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I  would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which  I'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole.  [Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a  two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I  could get with my machine's receiver next to it.      If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT  PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of  life's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our  thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By  eating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant  instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or  biblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what  they did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we  don't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and  that is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where  did the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it  is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then  die)    Warning about writing to the past: I had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel  future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from.  There were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an  Oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us,  and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the  others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by  \\\"advising\\\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into  reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that  the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to  provide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it  in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his  control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying  that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve  souls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was  finite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in  our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it  seemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then  some of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no  more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped  through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that  he had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body,  existing only on the wind.     MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls  whose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat  others as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a  lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for  playmates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back)    Accepting rides to the past: Once here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a  Prince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go  ahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry.  I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes  your work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross  paths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own  course of history, none the wiser.    As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped  back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still  make changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with  every 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which  loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less.  But he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had  to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand  to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers.     How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country,  our money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this:  Washington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to  congress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks  are making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big  corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the  banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but  mostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14  hours to build your auto?

And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in 'fanatic' Turkey  when they were expelled from Europe, especially Spain, by Saintly Christians,  and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and  liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects, all being exposed alike to the  rapacity of their common rulers. To one brought up, as most Americans have   been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of   the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious  differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they  were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every   nation in the world would have treated as treasonable.

Shaw  (History),  who  recently completed  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the Turkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in Rescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution, 1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree program in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for the Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the G. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.  Editor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and European and Turkish Jews?  Shaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish. I've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as time went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews, I collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a couple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the 500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and coming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire Avenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman Jewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became motivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The Jews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book is quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who tend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint of the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish sources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I approach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of view of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I finished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across additional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War II. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good deal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not actually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in the Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish diplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It was too late to add this new information to the book in press, so I decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research, mainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the Turkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second book, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped rescue Jews from the Nazis.  - How exactly did they do this?  The story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents the material in three parts, first of which deals with the period before the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in 1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi Germans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and the like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of reforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were being fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new talent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three months  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey arranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and were   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish universities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical personnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors came to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political scientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in Turkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the Berlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist, came to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics in Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the Nazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually came to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other German Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey. One  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical producer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to Turkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the Turkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul Hindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first phase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by Turkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in Turkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded themselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in the anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I even  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey praising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting the idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been persecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the Nazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The second part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in 1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and especially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They had migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of the century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the Turkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was threatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews throughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might happen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled to France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their Turkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the Nazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of anti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not worth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot to be a Turkish Jew.  - How so?  Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained its embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries until it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the end of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position to  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the actions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of the  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in particular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from the Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish citizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were arrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats would  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other officials and say in effect:  \\\"These people are Turkish citizens. You  can't do  this  to  them.\\\" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be released.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.  The Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey. They hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion of the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and manganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they usually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews. The Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps to secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded trains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and succeeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews were sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in Paris,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish consuls took place.  The greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned their  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The consuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens because  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews lining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get passports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their Turkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so processing the application would take  some time. In the meantime it was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on the streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them if they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because radios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of these  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a document called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  \\\"irregular fellow citizen.\\\" The  document said in  effect \\\"This person is  a former Turkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his Turkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if you  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.\\\"  The diplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on it. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they accepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this means, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who had relinquished their Turkish citizenship.  Actually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of Jews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to retain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these interventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all Jews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to prevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz before the Turkish consuls could do anything.  - Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?  There were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War II,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the information in this section of  the book relates to the situation in France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls sent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in reply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would present  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are Turkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the Nazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish consuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from Nazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran regularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas so they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were often  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern Europe  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these governments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result of the Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish Jews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to Auschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either escaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of southern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much better than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy fell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well. Incidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also worked to rescue Jews in that country.  - The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats acting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin from Nazi persecution.  Yes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their interventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their treaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German territory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey. On  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not discriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis claimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not discriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally. Turkey  protested,   saying,  \\\"You  are  dividing   our  citizens according to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that all  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion. Therefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews.\\\" American consuls in  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told American Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they couldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were being treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book takes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the Holocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European Jews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in Palestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in Istanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other Jewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also sent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These groups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out what was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at that  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn't imagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the first step was to get information, and the Turkish government let them use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and friends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out what was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the Nazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received assistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who served as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to 1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican representative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the Catholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was doing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern Europe.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these agencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even railroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much in Poland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the Polish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for the Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the so called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through the Black Sea to Istanbul.  Turkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its borders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was suffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The government,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the non-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by the Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and Palestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean from southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly opposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did not want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they feared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British constantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic and send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government, yielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For example, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700 Jewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish government  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British ambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all were lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish government allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to pass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during the Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these refugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to send money and food out of the country.  - Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be living in Israel.  Yes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to the first group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not go  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the non-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en route to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.  - And you have rescued it from obscurity.  Many studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do not focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of the scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of whom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a much smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the picture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to undertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.  When it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively small in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The rescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so significant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were murdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.  About  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  - translations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the story is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware of  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the people of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would not  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they could see the documents.  - What languages are used in the documents?  Most of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There is a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of the boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I did not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what Turkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A few documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did not necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in fact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying to  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For example, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency was  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in helping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President Roosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had been an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York City, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The documents related to his mission are in English.  I also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust historian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His father was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had gathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn't personally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more can  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone someday will make the effort.  - This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?  Right. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the Ottoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In addition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been actively involved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the coming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I helped organize  a large international conference  on the subject which was held in Istanbul in 1992.  - Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken place, what do you plan to do next?  I'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War for Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the years  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the victorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its independence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid II, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an important modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed all sorts of political movements.  Stanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in British History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning a second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate at Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School of  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the University of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the University of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to UCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute in  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National Endowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He has  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and Bosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor for lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish studies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and Culture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in Washington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional service activities and public lectures  in both the United States and Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited volume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2 vols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or reprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983, 1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York University Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation by the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the Holocaust: Turkey's  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry from Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan Publishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.  A pamphlet summarizing the book was published in Ankara, Turkey, in 1992.  Serdar Argic\",\" Kratz comments above show otherwise.   Bingo - now the question is, does the Glock's qualify?  Let's see the evidence that Kratz uses.   But first an aside.  Having an air gun proves nothing.  Moreover, my comments are based on what Kratz writes.  He's free to argue that he babbles in text but actually knows something off-line.   Harder than what?  I note that almost all revolvers work the same way, so it can't be \\\"harder than revolvers\\\".   Sure they can.  (Moreover, we know now that Kratz' sample is unrepresentative.)  We can look at the reasoning.  It is basically \\\"these Glocks are dangerous because they're not like my 1911/S&W third generation.\\\"  Part of that is true, but since those same people don't claim that revolvers, which share the relevant property, are dangerous, we see that the argument fails.   Why would I care?  I'm not looking for more bogus reasoning.   One can make hundreds of simple statements without having anyone \\\"getting right on your ass\\\".

Questions to Israelis   To:  shaig@Think.COM  Subject: Ten questions to Israelis  Dear Shai,  Your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.  In the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of Israeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have received from other quarters, according to which there are two distinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship (Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all times and present them at many public places, almost every day. These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab. You maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ? Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose ?  In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was established, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).  Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public official. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.  Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning 'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from Ma'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?  You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet Union into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they would not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about Israel were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so. I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.\",\"I am fortunate enough to have tickets for an Orioles-Red Sox game in   Baltimore on Saturday, July 31st.

I originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone here will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but are missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.  *** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it *** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a *** different version.  The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They are fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes, anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a \\\"virtual screen\\\", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included a simple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256 color GIF image into a buffer.  I also wrote a quick'n'dirty(tm) demo program that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three \\\"windows\\\".

But  most people aren't aware that in 1939 Hitler said that he would pattern his elimination of the Jews based upon what the Armenians did to Turkish people in 1914.        'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?'       (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W. Rosenbaum (Durusoy),            \\\"The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi\\\", p. 213.)   I refer to the Turks and Kurds as history's forgotten people. It does not serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of what happened in 1914 where a vicious society, run by fascist Armenians, decided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse, for wiping  out a peace-loving, industrious, and very intelligent and productive  ethnic group. What we have is a demand from the fascist government of x-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our people. And the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and  not lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century. We  cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to  keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because  of their religion or their race. Which means that I support the claims  of the Turks and Kurds to return to their lands in x-Soviet Armenia,  to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

Sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long, and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique. Or so I thought.  I went to Tuesday's game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the 'Stick was  a much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but  everything is a lot better.

Both the SDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's defense is basically nonmeasurable at present.  You can talk about how important calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls in the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various catcher's rank in \\\"defense\\\".     Looking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves (or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as I can tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics (such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking the ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to clear that up is playing and practice time.  I can't see how repetitions at AAA are any better then reps in the majors!     All we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  and Berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping the pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost all veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn the major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to learn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn't be supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over pitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But  given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.   Now, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league pitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring problem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he can't learn just as well while in the majors?  \",\"   I guess there are at least some people who are not able to support this claim.

I'm serious; I tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are any.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can look up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).    Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was \\\"rushed\\\", although there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the next year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job, and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being \\\"rushed\\\"; Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have been less likely to give up on him.  Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.

(Around 5 MB.)  I have a Quadra 950.  I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.          (using block-mode transfers) I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can          achieve 6.8 MB/s.  Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.  It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer, then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)  So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer,   Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer. Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer. Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.         ... Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer. Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.  Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously, and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho') each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.  Why?  Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time.) Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use the same bus to mac RAM?  Is there anything I can do?\",\"I've seen solar battery boosters, and they seem to come without any guarantee.

They had not died as soldiers die in the  heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands,  and exchanging blow for blow. They had died as the helpless must, with  their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself.\\\"   Serdar Argic\",\"  You are conveniently ommitting the fact that the Arab governments told the Arab citizens of Israel to leave Israel, join with the Arab armies so that after what they felt like an assured victory occured, these Arabs could return to their former homes, reclaim them as well as anything else they wanted that belonged to Jews.  When the Arabs lost, Israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as citizens.  What would you have done?  Let them in so they could kill Jews?  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens  because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave.  Of course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is impossible.  Therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the country.   No kibbutz that I have ever visited has any \\\"employees\\\" unless they had to hire some people for the restaurants, hotels etc if there weren't enough  people ON the kibbutz to do them.  In such cases, they are paid properly. If a kibbutz turns away an Arab, 9I have never seen or heard of this) but it reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz, not the whole kibbutz movement.   This just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli politics.  Although the  major parties in Israel aren't religious (however not totally secular), due to the format of the government (coalition) the religious parties have always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition. In fact, from what I heard the present government is the least influenced by the religious parties in the existance of Israel.  Israel CANNOT be called a secular state.  For instace, Haifa is the only city in the country (except for maybe some Arab cities) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath.   There are many other examples of religion in Israel.  Marriages in Israel are NOT contolled by the state, but by Rabbis and Priests.  Obviously your  disbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country you claim to know so much about.    Steve -- \",\" I understand, believe it or not, and there are any number of kinds of  conversation and communication I engage in that I wouldn't even consider  using this scheme for.  On the other hand, I don't see \\\"Clipper\\\" as providing  a secure channel--it just prevents casual eavesdropping.  This is part of why  I am not worried about it per se.  Trying to look at Clipper as a serious  security tool is simply ludicrous.  It's a voice scrambler, nothing more.  There is still plenty of market for real crypto.   They cost an arm and a leg, though. \\\"Clipper\\\" is obviously aimed at the mass  market.  It certainly won't put Cylink out of business.   This is old news.  I can do this now.   There ARE restrictions.  Example: We're a networking software vendor with a  large overseas share of our market.  We cannot currently ship PEM, or even  simple DES, in our products without case-by-case approval from the Department  of State.  ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to  compete in international information systems markets.  Sure, you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS's in  the USA.  I, on the other hand, want strong crypto (PKCS, for example) to be  the *default* for electronic mail, worldwide.  I want priests to be able to  hear confession over email.  I want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in  confidence over email, or doctors talk with patients.  I want to be able to  order products from my favorite Japanese mail-order catalog over the net.  I  want to be able to sign contracts, transact business, and so on  electronically.  This is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on  crytographic systems, especially beyond the borders of the USA.  Clipper is irrelevant, and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe,  all the better.  Its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put  more restrictions into place, on the theory that it is \\\"good enough for  anyone who has nothing to hide.\\\"  That argument is, of course, utter BS, just  as much as \\\"no one needs an assault rifle\\\". \",\"Is there a QIC-80 format tape drive that comes with an EISA controller ?

I mean, all the Braves have done is gone to two consecutive world series.  Also, being the Cubs fan that I am, I really have to hand it to all the Braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with that infernal cheer that they have.    However, I do have to protest anyone saying that all Cubs fans are stupid.  The way I see it, either I'm just too stupid to acknowledge it, or that observation was just plain wrong.  You might have us confused with Bear fans. ;)  Anyway, about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the Cubs would finish up last in their division.  (Even behind Florida?!?  Sheesh!)   These same people were predicting the Braves to clean up in their respective division.  Well,  we're ten games into the season and these people are a little less vocal now.  I wonder why.  Well, the way I see it, the East is up for grabs, and whoever wants it most is going to take it, with the exception of Florida.  Every team seems to have good batting and pitching, with Philly presently leading the pack.  But, I just have to point out, if the Cubs do take the East, they'll do it without the benefit of a competent manager.  However, and it pains me to say it, the pennant is going to go to the West.  Just had to get that off my chest.        Doc\",\" Well, actually, most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is based on some fantasy of how it happened. But that's OK, I understand you have a hockey background. Stats like \\\"plus/minus\\\" make RBI look good.   OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please answer yes or no, Roger:  Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs? AL only, please.  For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact that a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite, hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs, for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game. So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238 for Boston), the \\\"Red Jays\\\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in (particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that \\\"had Morris performed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\\\"   This is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.

I'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx in advance)  I want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There \\\"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.\\\"          Thanx in advance... Shaz....  [I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions. The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style of the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significant differences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying text.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by hand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the original, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are generally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved, but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there's much uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error.  But I also don't think there's enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that it has much practical effect.  Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot topic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it (though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details that don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there being multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in all the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've been referring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get referenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been editions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into single narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor objects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible has long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making editions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from a variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine one of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all inaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any edition that's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is. (Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a few translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best, I'm afraid.)\",\"    The argument goes as follows: Q-oid quotes appear in John, but not in the almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke. However, they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, and not an entirely different source.       We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usual explanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not consider their respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Luke that of Matthew (and probably that of Mark).   As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text. The evidence for that is not overwhelming, admittedly.       When they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order on putting John after the rest of the three?       Sure, an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would be fine. So what's that supposed to say? Am I missing something?       That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.   The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel of John itself. Is there any other evidence for it?   One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies. Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.     In other words, one does not know what the original of Mark did look like and arguments based on Mark are pretty weak.\",\" There are a couple.

I can't  remember him having any as of yet.)  Well, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris has truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and Toronto.

Though he stepped in it, he has been very good so far about admitting he doesn't know what he's talking about, and even more stunning is that he seems\",\" Not so.  Surveys have shown while the public thinks certain types of gun control may be acceptable they do believe they have an individual right to keep and bear arms, and that the police should not have /discretion/ over who may and may not own firearms.   By the end of the Clinton administration a lot of things will be screwed up.  Hell, we'll probably be just like England.   \\\"Tough titty\\\" ?  My how eloquent you are.  As for your claim, I think Clinton has a big fight ahead of him if he thinks he's going to pass some comprehensive gun legislation. He will sign the Brady Bill if it gets to his desk.  We will do whatever we can to either keep that from happening, or modify it such that it is acceptable to us.   Sorry, that's not possible.  And that's why we won't give them up either.  Legally or illegally, American's will keep their firearms. The number of unregistered weapons in New York City is in the millions. There aren't even close to that number of violent criminals there.   If the gov't was serious about stopping violent crime they would keep violent criminals in jail for a long long time where they belong instead of letting them out on early release.

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is public-key cryptography? * What's RSA? * Is RSA secure? * How fast can people factor numbers? * What about other public-key cryptosystems?   * What is public-key cryptography?    In a classic cryptosystem, we have encryption functions E_K and   decryption functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for any plaintext   P. In a public-key cryptosystem, E_K can be easily computed from some   ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published, so   that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed   from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.   That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie   and Hellman in 1976.    In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to   send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than   them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,   and you don't have to worry about spies.    This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an   extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,   applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the   mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.  * What's RSA?    RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and   Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at   RSA.COM. Here's a small example.    Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples   (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,   and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We   define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.    Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as   anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair   (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a   secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.  * Is RSA secure?    Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.   See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization   algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to   prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that   matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by   ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,   ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to   prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and   theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative   results.''  * How fast can people factor numbers?    It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra   and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three   weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;   each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The   algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a   bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers   n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in   any case.    An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple   polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n   log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,   but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100   and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.    Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few   years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are   developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from   factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number   field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic   sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)  * What about other public-key cryptosystems?\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Ten questions about Israel   Ten questions to Israelis -------------------------  I would be thankful if any of you who live in Israel could help to provide  accurate answers to the following specific questions. These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me.  1.      Is it true that the Israeli authorities don't recognize Israeli nationality ? And that ID cards, which Israeli citizens must carry at all times, identify people as Jews or Arabs, not as Israelis ?  2.      Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders and that Israeli governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be ?  3.      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons ? If so, could you provide any evidence ?  4.      Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ?  5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied territories are subject to different laws than non-Jews?  6.      Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947/48 to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return, while their Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return ?  7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948, as is done today in Bosnia-Herzegovina ?  8.      Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as members in kibbutzim?  9.      Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage marriages between Jews and non-Jews ?  10.     Is it true that Hotel Hilton in Tel Aviv is built on the site of a muslim cemetery ?  Thanks,\",\"Well, I'm afraid the time has come; my rice-burner has finally died.

I'm sure somebody here can provide an example where anecdotal evidence (and the interpretation of it) was upheld/verified by follow-on rigorous clinical trials.    Good point.  There has been a tendency by some on this newsgroup to \\\"circle the wagons\\\" to the viewpoint that anecdotal medical evidence is worthless (maybe to counter the claims of those who are presenting anecdotal evidence to support controversial subjects, such as the \\\"yeast hypothesis\\\").  But evidence is evidence - it requires a \\\"jury\\\" or a process to sort it out and determine the truth from the junk.  Medicine must continue to strive to better understand the workings of the body/mind for the purpose of alleviating illness - anecdotal evidence is just one piece of the puzzle;  it is not worthless.

The leaks occur through the seal of the  taillights.  Unfortunately, Ford has this with Most Probes and does not have a recall for it.  Very dissatisfying to say the least.   There is no drain holes that I know of.  I used a margine tub to drain it Regretably I waited three months as I was short cash and they wouldn't fix it under warrantee.  Then I paid dearly as it messed up my electrical system including a balance/motion sensor which is located near the fuel shutoff in  the trunk.  This resulted in my passive restraints malfunctioning--they would not retract.  So I ended up paying about $200 to have the sensor replaced;  $90 to have the tail lights resealed (they firts replaced the hatch gasket which I insisted was not the problem so they did not charge me for that when I proved to be right.); not to mention the water damage to the  covers to the trunk/spare com partment and algae in the taillights.  very annoying.

Have you ever asked a physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog? The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person cannot.   I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see, but I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?) I hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your  radio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well is not healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, and taste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not. That is God.   Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses, how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or a lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must force ourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves us enough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think we know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us  enough to help us through this world?   I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  When I do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience,  because it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see the results in the long term, I find that He has led me in the proper direction, even though it did not feel right at the time.  This is where our works as Christians are important:  As exercises of the body make the body strong, excercises of faith make the faith strong.     As for you, no one can \\\"convert\\\" you.  You must choose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to follow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with you the love we have received from God.  If you reject that, we have to accept your decision, although we always keep the offer open to you.  If you really want to find out why we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try praying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians about their experiences personally.  Then you may grow to understand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the logic of this world.

They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967 without civil and political rights.   It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza is not a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreign country for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians are concerned and as far as common sense has it.   It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens and the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.  Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel is entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be entitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel to enter the area.

I've got a problem that  I need as many people's help from as possible.  Before I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell you that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy meets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...  OK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family and I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the street, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me... her name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have been writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about 2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago.   By the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.  OK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming back to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I drove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent the whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though we had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being in person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met. (She's one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could ask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to  mention WAY out of my league...although I'm  not unattractive mind you), but she had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the extent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she knows I am a Christian.   Well, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such a thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid you not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.  In out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding dates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her). She has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended up leaving school....Now we are at the present...  Let me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....   \\\"Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm not going to KU anymore because something just isn't right.

I think it's just 12 games into the season myself, so I'm going to wait a bit before calling names.   I expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher, and I have no idea why Simmons ever wanted him.  On the other hand, I expect him to release Otto if he doesn't turn things around pretty fast.  (BTW, Otto's game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22, which points out a problem with the method since Otto's performance was infinitely bad, and excruciatingly prolonged.)   I think Merced's rookie year was a bit flukey, but aren't you willing to give him some more at bats (and Tomlin a few more starts) before acting so gloomy?   No he didn't.  Walk is a time bomb.  He has no stuff whatsoever, and when the league finally realizes this, it won't be pretty at all.   Don't be so fast.  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele, which was a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors. Meanwhile, I'm not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a six-year free agent before the 1992 season.   Twice through the rotation, and you've given up?  Yikes.   But so has his age, at least in baseball terms.  The useful half-life of a 34- year-old injury-prone catcher can't be much longer than a year.   But he wanted to be a Dodger, and felt he had something to prove after his disastrous 1992.  I don't think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign him.   He certainly wasn't last year.   Hey, that's the \\\"Skates Smith\\\" package deal.  Anybody who acquires Lonnie for his defense or base-running (particularly at this stage) is a real weirdo.   If that's the goal of the team ownership, than I don't see why Sauer gets a zero for making his boss happy.  I don't know what he has or hasn't said about revenue sharing, so I can't comment there.   It's annoying, but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them to retain Jeff King, it was probably unavoidable.  Meanwhile, I think bigger accomplishments of Simmons' tenure were getting some value for John Smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch last year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something in 1993.  Foley, Smith, and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement parts, which means that even if fail it hasn't done serious damage to the Bucs' future.   Does this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case?  I never heard the outcome of this.  When will the final verdict be in on this?   I'm not sure who was the idiot in this case, so I don't know who to blame.  It might have been Doug Danforth, after all.  In fact, I *seriously* suspect it was Doug Danforth, who has shown his willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is pointed at his feet.

You may as well know that all this stuff about the secret source of the Clipper announcement is because of a silly mistake.  I am the administrator of csrc.ncsl.nist.gov, alias first.org.  It's a system set up to help out the needs of FIRST, a Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, which  includes a number of world-wide incident response teams such as CERT/CC and other places in Europe.  As to the VRFY and EXPN commands, they are normally disabled, since early on we didn't want crackers to find out the names of incident response folks on our mailing lists.  We had a disk crash several months ago which required completely rebuilding the O/S files - same old story, our backups weren't especially helpful.  As you can guess, I didn't remember to re-disable VRFY and EXPN until I saw people on the net trying to find out who was behind clipper@csrc...  When I saw people's names posted here, I felt it was time to clear things up.  So, EXPN and VRFY on csrc have always been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with  Clipper.  I posted the White House announcements at the request of policy folks here because csrc also provides Usenet service.  I posted them from an account called 'clipper.'  I also created an alias called 'clipper' that contains the addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and Advisory Board, set up under law of the Computer Security Act of 1987, and addresses of other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography, security, and privacy - I believe that these individuals were included on this list because NIST felt it important to get them the Clipper information first-hand.  The 'clipper' alias is there for the benefit of those named above.  It is  not a source for information, it was set up solely to monitor any initial traffic.  Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get traffic that is not already duplicated on Usenet.  While you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this, I would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives of the individuals on the 'clipper' alias - I've already apologized to them for what's happened.  Disabling EXPN and VRFY is an increasingly common practice (albeit unfriendly to some), and any effect of disabling it again was unintentional.\",\" Dorin, Let's not forget that the soldiers were killed not murdered. The distinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people, not people whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these soldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. And resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters). Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by resistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the hostile occupiers in WWII.

EDT         THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen,  two months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our  national deficit and to increase our investment in the American  people, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget  plan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope  and opportunity in the country.                Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress,  which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed  the House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support  of a majority of the United States Senate.               All of these members of Congress know it's time to get  the economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a  fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.   Unfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate  have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working  the will of the majority on the jobs bill.              When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every  state and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue  is not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking  for full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't  care about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying  the rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the  table and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of  dignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their  families and drawing a paycheck.              They're asking those of us who have the privilege of  serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our  economy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working  with the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some  of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs  plan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on  jobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet  national needs.                Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.   Today I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what  size package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of  the American people.               But even as we make those reductions and the package  will be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the  minds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is  the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the  dramatic rise in violent crime.               So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an  additional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities  to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the  fiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a  matching effort by local governments, this could put as many as  10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in  communities all across our nation.              At a time when too many of our people live in fear of  violent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many  people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their  homes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments  America can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that  investment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.                I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep  the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no  mistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I  ever have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight  for their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.              I want to thank the police officers who are here today  and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here  that I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to  rehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the  summer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to  talk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement  concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country  to have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and  a brighter and more peaceful future.              I say what I say today not just because it's good for  law enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in  these communities.  I have always supported community policing not  only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate,  but because it cements better relationships between people in law  enforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces  the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the  chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.              These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.   I promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put  another 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four  years.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind  the core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.                So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the  jobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if  you will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept  the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to  building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will  create real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my  part now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.                I want now to give the people who are here with me on  the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the  American people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished  Attorney General.                 *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *               Q   Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that  the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over  the suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional  dialogue?              THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have -- they wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all,  I made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's  a lot of support in the business community and the labor community --  people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden  of the present system on many of our major employers, particularly  many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the  strength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision  that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general  tax.              Q   Do you personally believe that the American public  is ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I  mean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --              THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I  will say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the  benefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is -- everyone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you  streamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that  there's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or  over-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive  care in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows  absolutely massive savings to the health care system.              The real question is whether you can transfer those  savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have  virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I  have no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is  the polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned,  they say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an  affordable health care system.              But I don't think that has anything to do with this  stimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first  and foremost.  They want that more than anything else.              Q   Now that you've announced your willingness to  compromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of  your package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer  jobs is one.              THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the  highway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let  me say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime  bill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a  supplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think  we need to do that.              I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the  enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately  and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people  with AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be  done.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the  safety of the public depends on that.                There are a number of other things that I don't -- I  don't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator  Mitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole  called me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call  him back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we  discussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said  that I would not make any statements about any specifics until at  least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could  reach some accord.                So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been  already, and let's see if they can talk it out.              Q   When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator  Mitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200  million, that you want that as part of the package?              THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word  for Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator  Dole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.   But I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I  wanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a  reformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even  more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the  American people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly  consistent with that.              Thank you.\",\" Is this an advantage to MS Windows or to Xt?

Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to do with the use of this substance in human nutrition?   No, it's undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid which is an excitatory neurotransmitter.  There is also evidence that excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain conditions like stroke, drowning and Lou Gehrig's disease, just to name a few. This is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid in foods.  People are not receiving intra-ventricular injections of glutamate.   I don't know about premier, but it's certainly an important one.   Sez you.  Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any controlled studies.  Infant mice and other models are useful as far as they go, but they're not relevant to the matter at hand.  Which is not to say that I favor its use in things like baby food--a patently ridiculous use of the additive.  But we have no reason to believe that MSG in the diet effects humans adversely.   Wrong.  Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink? Milligrams worth.  Compare that to a glass of milk.  Do you know how much glutamate is present in most protein-containing foods compared to that added by the use of MSG?

I still believe that doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would not have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent the many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done. And 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that  would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank goodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine that helps me.    I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That you would go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second opinion, and then move on with your life. Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in  this field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses. These are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over the country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going to a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was  helpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very unproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research, make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.  A recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of what I'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's not a put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors are only human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.  I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things that is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart, or failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's because  those things are much more tangible and have much more concise  definitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to find your way out of it.   I have chosen the latter.   Linda lindae@netcom.netcom.com \",\"1.

According to accounts by those who were able to  save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful  events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then  taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people   well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these  places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.  They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the  Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality  problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers  who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and  Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the   Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.   I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is   destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air.

I was diagnosed last May w/Crohn's of the terminal ileum. When I got out of the hospital I read up on it a bit, and came across several studies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducing inflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies are discussed in \\\"Inflammatory Bowel Disease,\\\" MacDermott, Stenson. 1992.]  But if I recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). In the studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of the studies), but, if I recall correctly, there was no restriction of the _other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed layperson's perspective, this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs are consumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of \\\"bad\\\" prostanoid products to \\\"good\\\" prostanoid products could still be fairly \\\"bad.\\\" Isn't this ratio the issue?  What's the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPA supplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs appear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories).\",\" A cash award is OK.

I have seen the film called \\\"The Gay Agenda\\\" and along with my church we found it to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of editting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people are actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as many as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something obviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian Fundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants your report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed homosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list. I do not feel threatened by gays, I don't understand why others are.  The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min- istries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.  THE FOUNDER OF AN \\\"EX-GAY\\\" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO  by Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)  In December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa awards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE INDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering discontented gays and lesbians \\\"a way out of the homosexual death-style\\\" through prayer.  \\\"I'd like to give the award back,\\\" Caligiuri now laughs, \\\"I'm no longer deserve it.\\\"   Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national \\\"ex-gay\\\" movement peaked with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well as Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex- gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  \\\"There's no reality in it,\\\" he says, \\\"I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.\\\"   Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their sexual urges and embracing Christianity.  \\\"We offer support to people who are seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,\\\" explains Bob Davies, director of Exodus.  He ventures that \\\"about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo- sexuality are men.\\\"   \\\"Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting their time,\\\" says Lisa Seeley, a former \\\"redeemed lesbian\\\" who worked with Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  \\\"These organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.\\\"   \\\"It's possible to change your identity or your behavior,\\\" says sex educator Brian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. \\\"But it's really impossible to change your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay, but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.\\\"   Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all hell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both their romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted by a man he picked up in a bar.  \\\"I was really drunk,\\\" he recalls, \\\"and I went home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all night, and the next morning he raped me again.\\\"   When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the home he shared with his ex-lover.  \\\"He had another man there with him,\\\" Caligiuri recalls.  \\\"I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay is about, I don't want to be this way anymore.\\\"   Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery with others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's gay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its first public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance, Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed for hell.   Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  \\\"We were listed under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,\\\" Caligiuri says, \\\"so people thought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out where the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo- sexuality.\\\"  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says, adding, \\\"They'll do anything to reach these people.\\\"   \\\"David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,\\\" recalls Peter Kelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, \\\"like that he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.\\\"   Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on Raphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  \\\"They were relieved,\\\" he recalls. \\\"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better that I should be a 'reformed' gay person.\\\"   But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  \\\"By the time I appeared on Sally's show,\\\" \\\"I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their father.  I was horny all the time.\\\"   Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his numerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he \\\"used to go to bookstores and get blowjobs.\\\"  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping with other \\\"reformed\\\" homosexuals.   \\\"I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex with one another,\\\" Caligiuri says.  \\\"We'd go to conferences in other cities, and we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody else.\\\"   By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988, Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show's host asked him if he ever \\\"acted on temptation,\\\" his answer was a lie.   Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He was suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating yeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  \\\"I was too sick to go to church,\\\" he explains.  \\\"The more time I spent away from those people the more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.\\\"   Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local church and closed the ministry's doors.  \\\"I'd convinced myself that there is no need in the world for ex-gay people,\\\" he says.   Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (\\\"I'm interest- ed in belief systems that aren't judgemental.\\\"), considering romance (\\\"But not with a CHristian!\\\"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to. \\\"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,\\\" he says.  \\\"I want to eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I may have brought to our community.\\\"  ---end article---  Caligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles of former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th similar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some, like Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian \\\"Lazarus Project\\\" of West Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values of sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as \\\"Love In Action\\\" and others, who either once claimed to have been \\\"reformed\\\" or who were too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed in them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of \\\"sealing\\\" their new heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses and bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous \\\"sin\\\" through a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno- cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also mrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on them, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain functions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common- place.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the threat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's _\\\"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as Maury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  I seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and self-acceptance.\",\" Not to mention that the G-men believed the children didn't have gas masks.  But that was not, with respect to the children, the point of the gassing.

I busted a gut on that one.  Someone else on the net observed that the administration's appeal to a woman's \\\"motherly instinct\\\" would never wash with feminists and liberals if a republican were in the White House.

My computer configuration is :  486DX-50 Mhz. 8/256 kB EISA (Micronics Motherboard ASIC EISA 50Mhz) 16MB Ram ST3283N 248 MB Harddisk, SCSI UltraStor24F EISA Cache Controller  When I use Norton6.0 Harddisk benchmark, I get a Harddisk data transfer about 980 kb/sec. and sometimes 1MB/sec. Is that good ? I thought that with EISA I could get about 2MB/sec.  Somewhere in the manual for my harddisk I have read, that some host  adapters need to perform a low-level format to optimize the harddisk  performance in that system, do I need that ? A guy I know, gets a HD transfer about 1.2MB/sec, and he has an ST3283A and a ISA 486DX-50, how can a ISA with the same system be faster ?  Is there anything that I can do to get a speedier harddisk ?                                           Thanks.  phantom@diku.dk   (e-mail is preffered)  \",\"As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager  I recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with  the results.  The catalog description is as follows:   The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager   that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a  professional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two  counter-rotating \\\"thumbs\\\" that move in one-inch orbits --  releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.   Pressure Point Massager    A2623   $109  To order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021.  ******** NOTE: When I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price was $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was   QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it, and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it looks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a reason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could  use the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old  one.  VERY reasonable people. ********  I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I  would be described as \\\"structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches  and exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.   If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough time, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus,  more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require  physical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit  to get the prescription for p.t.    The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache (sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my  physical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles  in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the  headache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to  while it is being massaged.  I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing someone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my  neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in  the past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient  p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up  in the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.  I have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base unit is about a 14\\\" x 9\\\" rectangle, about 3-3/4\\\" high, with handles on each side, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal \\\"thumbs\\\" are about  1-1/2\\\" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2\\\" above the base.  The thumbs  are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more  toward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in  either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side  of the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either side.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.                    _______________________________                 |  __    _______________    __  |                 | |  |  |  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |  \\\\^^/   \\\\^^/  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |                 | |  |  |  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |                 | |__|      |__| |                 |_______________________________|   For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if  laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or  neck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or standing, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are also impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I  don't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works  well for me.  For my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager behind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or not so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.   If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches  whenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use  than the commonly used \\\"home-made\\\" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together  (with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and  move the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than  nothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are  not in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't  pin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this  is to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple  considerations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.  Not only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion  for my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my neck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard against it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a few days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.   After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point,  the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.   I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the  most vulnerable point for me.  It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades, although, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at a time) to really work it out.  I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've had it such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also  to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this  was very timely  for me.  This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been in business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and, while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones I've seen such as \\\"Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog\\\" or \\\"Mature Wisdom\\\". I'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no big surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs,  particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.

With I/O overlap, your CPU can continue to \\\"think\\\" while disk operations are underway, whereas without overlap, your CPU sits idly waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take an *eternity*, compared to a fast CPU.  So, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you do.  One way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it possible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move the data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and bus mastering.  IDE, however, is defined by the standard AT interface created for the IBM PC AT, which requires the CPU to move all the data bytes, with no DMA.\",\"  ahh, yes, this is a fun topic.

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper- work, and left for the Zhdanov District. That's in Azerbaijan, near the Nagorno Karabagh region.  After the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically in Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said \\\"uprising\\\" in Azerbaijani, but I don't think it was really an uprising, just a  demonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the  Zhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even  women; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here,  and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There were some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the Armenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site. I was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew  wouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really  bad. I didn't know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me, \\\"There's unrest everywhere, be careful.\\\" Well I had a project going on. I told the Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on  and said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn't allow it, they  said, \\\"Nothing's going to happen to you, we've entrusted the matter to the  police, we've warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.\\\"  Well, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he  knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This man didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and  afterward he spent the night with us, too.  I sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, \\\"The situation is very tense, be careful.\\\"  We finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the morning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I shouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else's business travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it  and my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus,  they sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out  they knew what was happening in Sumgait.  I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is closed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the  buses aren't running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two minutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private drivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, \\\"Let's go find some other way to get there.\\\" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to take us to Sumgait.  He took us there. But the others had said, \\\"I wouldn't go if you gave me a thousand rubles.\\\" \\\"Why?\\\" \\\"Because they're burning the city and killing the Armenians. There isn't an Armenian left.\\\" Well I got hold of myself so I could still stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we  set off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, \\\"In fact there aren't any Armenians left. 'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them.\\\" Well  I was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me,  \\\"How old are you, old man?\\\" He wants to know: if I'm being that quiet, not  saying anything, maybe it means I'm an Armenian. \\\"How old are you?\\\" he asks  me. I say, \\\"I'm 47.\\\" \\\"I'm 47 too, but I call you 'old man'.\\\" I say, \\\"It  depends on God, each person's life in this world is different.\\\" I look much older than my years, that's why he called me old man. Well after that he was silent, too.  We're approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon. Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he was waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I'm sitting there with them, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant there were no Armenians with us.  I look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the  street, you know, and there's no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They stopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature  shafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .  Along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's  not. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I'm an Armenian, but I speak  their language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for  \\\"nut,\\\" or \\\"little nut,\\\" as \\\"pundukh,\\\" but \\\"fundukh\\\" is actually correct. The  pronunciations are different. Anyone who says \\\"pundukh,\\\" even if they're not  Armenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says,  \\\"There was a car there, with five people inside it,\\\" he says. \\\"They started  hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn't let the people out,\\\" he says, \\\"they wouldn't let them get out of the car.\\\" I only saw  the car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from Baku to Sumgait and back . . .  When they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there's a short guy, his eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. \\\"We're Azerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no Armenians here.\\\" He did come up to me when  we were pulling our things out and says, \\\"Maybe you're an Armenian, old man?\\\"  But in Azerbaijani I say, \\\"You should be ashamed of yourself!\\\" And . . . he  left. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had  to . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own  home.  They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that's where the Kavkaz store  and three large, 12-story buildings are. That's the beginning of down-town. I  saw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I  couldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it  was a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing  remained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I saw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About 30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.  I see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are closed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the crowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots. Several shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier.  Someone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the  soldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one  armored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning  off Sumgait.  I walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by  their gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. I joined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us and asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see. But I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly  recognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer people. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block. I can't get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as  to get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking  behind him. And he's shouting into a megaphone: \\\"Comrades, the Armenian- Azerbaijani war has begun!\\\"  The police have megaphones like that. So they're talking and walking around  the second microdistrict. I see that they're coming my way, and turn off  behind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings,  and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every corner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were  doing I can't say, because I couldn't get up close to them, I was afraid. But  the most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least find out if my children were alive or not . . .

It would be ideal if we could believe for a while, just to try out religion, and only then determine which course of thought suits us best.  But again, this is not possible.  Not that religion warrants belief, but the belief carries with it some psychological benefits.  There are also some psychological burdens, too.   Well, if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism, they could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually \\\"believing\\\" in racism.

But the problem is that : religions cause enormous harm to non-believers and to humanity as a whole : (holy wars, inquisitions, inter-religious hatred, impedence of science : & intellectual progress, us-&-them attitudes etc etc.  Need I say more?). : I really don't know what we can do about them.  Any comments? :     I have always held that there should be no attempt to change a persons attitude or lifestyle as long as it makes them happy and does not tax anybody else. This seems to be ok for atheists. You don't get an atheist knocking on your door, stopping you in the airport, or handing out literature at a social event. Theists seem to think that thier form of happy should work for others and try to make it so.     My sister is a  born again, and she was a real thorn in the side for my entire family for several years. She finally got the clue that she couldn't help. During that period she bought me \\\"I was atheist, now I'm Xtian\\\" books for my birthday and Xmas several times. Our birthday cards would contain verses. It was a problem. I told my mom that I was going to send my sister an atheist piece of reading material. I got a \\\"Don't you dare\\\". My mom wasn't religious. Why did she insist that I not send it ??     Because our society has driven into us that religion is ok to preach, non-religion should be self contained. What a crock of shit. I finally told my sister that I didn't find her way of life attractive. I have seen exactly 0 effort from her on trying to convert me since then.     I'm sick of religious types being pampered, looked out for, and WORST OF ALL . . . . respected more than atheists. There must be an end in sight.\",\" That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled. Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on self-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk.  The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will notice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called a \\\"bingo card\\\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name and a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company and include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have nothing to mail out accept the catalog.  A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry magazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They use the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics. This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \\\"23% of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors.\\\" And finally, some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For example, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.  The other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines include how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the advertiser can attempt to cull out the \\\"literature collectors\\\" from the serious potential customers.  \\\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\\\"  What's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?    Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more   than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of   weeks later.    If you are really, really serious and you really, really want   the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also   cut about 15 days off the the response time.

Thanks in advance, --Tim \",\"The latest Israeli \\\"proposal\\\", first proposed in February of 1992, contains  the following assumptions concerning the nature of any \\\"interim status\\\"  refering to the WB and Gaza, the Palestinians, implemented by negotiations. It states that:        >Israel will remain the existing source of authority until \\\"final status\\\"     is agreed upon;    >Israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the      Interim Self-Government Arrangements (ISGA);    >The ISGA will apply to the \\\"Palestinian inhabitants of the territories\\\"     under Israeli military administration. The arrangements will not have a      territorial application, nor will they apply to the Israeli population      of the territories or to the Palestinian inhabitants of Jerusalem;    >Residual powers not delegated under the ISGA will be reserved by Israel;    >Israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd;    >Israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects-     external, internal- and for the maintenance of public order;    >The organs of the ISGA will be of an administrative-functional nature;    >The exercise of powers under the ISGA will be subject to cooperation and      coordination with Israel.     >Israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the      areas of administration, justice, personnel, agriculture, education,     business, tourism, labor and social welfare, local police,     local transportation and communications, municipal affairs and religious     affairs.  Several question do come to mind concerning the \\\"success\\\" we all hope for  in the ongoing negotiation process. These arrangements certainly seem to  be essentially a rejection of any Palestinian \\\"interim\\\" self-control.  Without exposing itself to unwarranted risks and creating irresversible  vulnerability, can Israel reasonably put forward (at later points in the  negotiating process) more \\\"relaxed\\\" proposals for this\\\"interim\\\" period?  How should proposals (from either side) be altered to temper their  \\\"maximalist\\\" approaches as stated above?

This accelerator plugs into the SE's lone expansion port and thus no soldering.  You will however, need a long TORX wrench to get the case open (but that's not really a big deal).  Does that sound like what you were looking for?\",\" I used to think this way, and not just about X. For example, incorrect English constructs such as \\\"its raining\\\" or \\\"it's window id\\\" annoy me. However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!).  On a related topic, who is to say that \\\"color\\\" is more or less correct than \\\"colour\\\" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API terms such as \\\"XAllocColor\\\" and \\\"colormap\\\".  In a world that uses the term \\\"Windows\\\" to refer to Microsoft Windows, perhaps the time has come to accept \\\"X Windows\\\" as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say, \\\"the X Window System\\\" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it. Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short, snappy, descriptive title (\\\"X\\\" is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called \\\"Microsoft Windows\\\" or \\\"the Microsoft Window System\\\" or how about just plain \\\"Microsoft\\\"!  To summarise (or should that be \\\"summarize\\\") the point of this message: I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be \\\"windowing system\\\"). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System. \",\" THis is from the same people who make the claim that our minivan is outsellin theirs.... implying that the Nissan Quest/ Murcury Villager are out-selling the Chrysler mini-vans.... not only is this not true at all, but it was a stupid claim to make... the commercial was part of the introduction campaign for the  vans.

If the gospels are the least bit accurate, then there can be little doubt that Jesus belived hell was a reality.  As a teacher, what would be the wise and loving thing to do if people in your audience were headed there?  To warn them!  It would, however,  be rather cruel and/or sadistic to believe that such a place exists  and then remain quiet about it.    The only scenario I can envision in which dimished respect would be justified is if Jesus knew there was no such place as hell, and spoke about it anyway, just to scare people.

Or does the server generate a software cursor.  You can generally tell the difference just by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity, it's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor, I think you're probably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually checking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just  that.

What I see as arrogance and the problem I have  with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just  Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.    Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal  sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these  matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them  but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus  anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that leads to arrogance.

Next, define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions and specify the frequency that it should be used (i.e. monthly).  Quicken will/can not automatically make the transactions for you, but now all you do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be entered at once.  Additionally if you are using the Bill Minder, it will remind you when each transaction group is due.  For example, you could have three transaction groups.

But to suggest that a *disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is  taking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease for lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed blindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare say all of us would be walking into walls.  Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real* careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for  sin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the result of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was blind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any other STD is a *punishment\\\" for sexual sin, what do we do with  diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as debilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a specific behavior or lifestyle?  Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin. The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central message of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins, and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of our sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He has graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or  some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that Jesus made.  In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ, no more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think it's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus healed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS. She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed  relationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be, but God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining weight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes her improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.  Paul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I  think applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I (or something like that).

One cardinal rule    is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is    incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.  2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were    outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When    questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault    was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were    thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew    you could!  3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,    hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and    referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm    more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not    related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up    some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's    now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by    the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I    was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI    agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say    uncomplimentary.  4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that    the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the    reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing    this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references    to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around    the \\\"He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\\\"    flag.  Sigh.  5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege    reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought    processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button    because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My    only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to    the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to    an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in    the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the    forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In    that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones    Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:    Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and    other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the    BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have    been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it    was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's    paranoid delusions.     --   #include <std_disclaimer.h>\",\"This notice will be posted weekly in sci.space, sci.astro, and sci.space.shuttle.

The argument was  1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game. 2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%.  3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and earned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12% of defense and pitching is 88% of defense. 4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.  Pete is usually sharper than that. My own feel is that fielding is in the 25-33% of defense range; call it 30-70 between fielding and pitching.   I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe 45-5, or even 40-10. Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds identical batting stats (which wouldn't be that unreasonable), and even if you don't let Roberto steal a single base, they'll score a lot more than the Oleruds by going first-to-third more often.

I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript. It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation processed PS.  The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.  We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's demo though).

If  you asked  somone,  who  had never heard of hockey before, if LA played in the Smythe division what do you think  that  the  response  would  be? What  if you asked this person if LA played in the West division?  The naming of  divisions  after  long-dead  entrepreneurs  is  unnecessary obfuscation.    Hardly.  The \\\"established\\\" situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al. The  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team could successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  did was formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop- olistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth- er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly debatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de- bate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made, however, is that people played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smythe and his pals showed up.   What's wrong with best defenceman, period?  Was there  ever  a  better defenceman?   Was  there  ever a better player?

Even as a libertarian, I have to admit government does do some things I like.  There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft.

(Keep in mind, though, most of the people in the city will never attend a single performance there, so they might feel differently about having to help pay for it.)  However, I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to give government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis.  In fact, we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely because it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other issues.  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  They do not try to decide just whether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speech should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  You can imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority on a case-by-case basis.  Not so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly what they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.  Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a case-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a case-by-case basis.  There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with free enterprise.  But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having a government that interferes with free enterprise in an \\\"efficient\\\" manner; I call it political market failure.

The processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the computer is used in its designed purpose.  Comparing processor speed is pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed to increase speed among other things.

Yes, he calls the rig an \\\"electronic brake\\\" since the engine noticeably slows when the key is down.  My car, unfortunately, has so much computer junk under the hood that it's astonishingly sensitive to RFI.  If I key a 2W HT over the engine with the hood open, the car loses timing due to the RF leaking into the  distributor pickup.  Very poor design.  I will, however, point out that ham radio operators are usually quite willing to help when interference is detected.  Remember that any interference is wasted power; if I put out 1W in the TV band, that's 1W that I am not putting out in the band I am trying to transmit on, and 1W can often be the difference between a nice card hanging on the wall, and nothing.

He really had very little reason to believe it, other than raw hope.  By fantasy, I certainly don't mean Velikovskian manias.   I'm not familiar with the history of this experiment, although, arguably, I should be.   I think that it is enough if his contemporaries found the result surprising. That's not what I'd quibble about.  What I'd like to know are Toricelli's reasons for doing his experiment; not the post hoc _constructed_ reasons, but the thoughts in his head as he considered the problem.  It may be impossible to know much about Toricelli's thoughts; that's too bad if it is so.  One of Root-Bernstein's services to science is that he has gone rooting about in Pasteur's and Fleming's (and other people's) notes, and has discovered some surprising clues about their motivations.  Pasteur never publicly admitted his plan to create mirror-image life, but the dreams are right there in his notebooks (finally public after many years), ready for anyone to read.  And I and my friends often have the most ridiculous reasons for pursuing results; one of my best came because I was mad at a colleague for a poorly-written claim (I disproved the claim).  Of course, Toricelli's case may be an example of a rarety: where the fantasy not only motivates the experiment, but turns out to be right in the end.

The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence-- God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree, Science.   My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations, for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone. Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have  children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that is made possible.   People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death, and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world.   This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely  prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary  alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,   go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us?   I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not, but I will say this:  Before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body they have been given, they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to  believe their search is displeasing to God.\",\"NUT CASE PANICS!!!!JUMPS THE GUN ON THE NET BEFORE GETTING FACTS STRAIGHT!!!! \",\" I believe you have the correct files.

And Windows 3.1 is also flexible enough at install time that you can copy all the files onto your hard disk, which greatly speeds things up and makes them less annoying, if you can spare the 7 or so compressed megs.   No, we're not.  But we're also not going to promote pandering to corporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience.  I don't *like* dealing with floppies.  Personally, I have no use for changing the registration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to be solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour reinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one way or another.  So, while I'm not going to put much time into it myself, here's the procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:  1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want to install it.  I've been using c:\\\\WINSTALL myself.  2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\\\\WINORIG.  3.  Install from c:\\\\winstall.  4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.       i.e., comp *.* \\\\winorig\\\\*.* >\\\\report.txt  5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming they didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one file should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate said offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hex editor, and do the same for the modified one.  6.  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don't really do cryptography.  It's probably just an xor key or something; I think MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing his copy than with \\\"real pirates\\\" who will probably just disassemble the damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original floppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able to back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a compare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).  As I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and don't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one directory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff I've mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if they'd ever find out.  If you aren't careful with the disk editor, you could also mung something important... duh.  I guess that's a disclaimer.  Have at it....

I have thought about the implications, and it is scary.    We have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have  decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the thrill of a younger, more attractive woman.  If we accept that it is legitimate for Jane to have divorced, how can we not accept anyone's decision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can have a more \\\"deep, committed relationship.\\\"  Marriage is not a state of being, it is a mutual journey in life. Love is not a passive feeling, it must be actively willed.  Is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many  years who stayed home to care for the children because he can't be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful young blonde?  The real solution for both in the couple to make a renewed effort.    Hold fast to the faith.  Has not the Lord repeatedly compared His relation to His people as a faithful and enduring husband?  We learn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and remain faithful through times of trial.  My spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed. If it were to resume growing (it is in remission, thanks be to God!) then perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexual relations.  That's life...the Lord would certainly not give me permission to seek someone else to satisfy my \\\"needs.\\\"    The idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple \\\"grows apart\\\" seems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaning of marriage that I feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint of compromise.

Or is it all hypothetical?\",\"  No matter how \\\"absurd\\\" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use.  The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.  It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo- Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man.  This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers have done).  Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I think the important aspect is the result.

There are no other alternatives.  And if we accept one or the other of those two premises, then again there are two alternatives, either creation was random, or was according to some plan.    If it was random, I am unable to accept that the complex nature of our world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creatures could exist as they do.  Therefore I am left with creation under the control of an intelligence capable of devising such a scheme.  I call that intelligence God.

There is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is determnined. This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about- an event can have value.  The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment, from teaching, training, observation and experience and are only significant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical activity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a hill. How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to establish your values. Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any \\\"absolute\\\" sense. That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been conditioned; there is no \\\"truth\\\" content. The whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality. I didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and to be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human thought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil, etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no weight whatsoever.\",\"I'm working upon a game using an isometric perspective, similar to that used in Populous.  Basically, you look into a room that looks similar to the following:                               xxxx                          xxxxx   xxxx                      xxxx    x       xxxx                  xxxx        x           xxxx              xxxx     2      xxxx     1      xxxx              x           xxxx    xxxx           x              x       xxxx            xxxx       x              x   xxxx             o      xxxx   x              xxxx              3 /|\\\\         xxxx                  xxxx            /~\\\\     xxxx                      xxxx            xxxx                          xxxx    xxxx                              xxxx  The good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move around in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision. [*]  Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded for a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slope of 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).  I've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried this before, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:  1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a packed->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the \\\"jaggies.\\\"  I'm now considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary). Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed, thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?  2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort the original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed. Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape?  Currently I take:    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32  33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48  49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64  and produce:                           1  2  3  4 33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8 49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12             53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16                         57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32                                     61 62 63 64  Line 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1. Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3. This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But it causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way? Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed?  Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective? I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering. Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.  [*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1) *are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to be an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points. This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have to change size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that this approximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing.  Hopefully the \\\"context\\\" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches hanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.

Raw HC11 parts have factory set ROM images, and as such are useless to the hobbyist. HC811 parts have EEPROM, allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming.  Some Motorola parts (such as the HC705K1) have EPROM, making them user programmable, but come with options of either windowed or sealed.

I've never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists that he has, so I'd love to have a cite.   Wrong.  There's one gun design where that can happen, and it is supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber. (Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under the hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe manner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their trigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.   The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the described circumstance) is near zero.

For example the fact that all property thefts, regardless of value, are not punished equally is an inequality which protects those who have a lot of money from having it stolen. You could easily define equality to regard the property in terms of it's significance for the owner. This would a form of equality that would be skewed toward poorer people.  In fact, most anti-gay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal  protection. They make it an offense to damage people based on a  motivation of hatred for sexual orientation.

I must congratulate your analytical and excellent reportage about  Diana. From  the writings  of tye biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian, she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish gene mix is dynamite.  Levon K.

Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models.

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to have a \\\"dirty\\\" amp.     Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs  Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.     for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt    radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet     away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.    If you experience the problem frequently, it may be     caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station    nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio     transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,    etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are    correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.     If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite    chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably    being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can    be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).    Good instructions are included with the chokes.    If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your    neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof    or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things    a radio operator can do to reduce interference.  And please remember to be friendly when approaching your local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the  cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b. interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.    BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it. Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers to take any precautions.  Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more than 10).  So if you hear \\\"This is WA1QT\\\" or some other call starting with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham. CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required to) and fire/police have other private ids.      \",\": Frank Crary posted: : : Sure, but the difference in per-capita crime rates predates the : : gun control laws: The homicide rate in England was a tenth that : : of America, back when anyone in England could buy a gun without : : any paperwork at all.  : Steve Manes asks: : > Got a citation for this?  : Colin Greenwood from Scotland Yard did a study that showed that gun : control has had no effect on crime or murder rates in the UK.

For example, Article IV: \\\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated\\\"; Article V: \\\"no person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment by a Grand Jury ...  nor shall any person ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\\\"; Article VIII: \\\"excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted\\\".  Now I've never heard that Constitutional rights apply only to citizens; aren't they meant to apply equally to all *persons* living in the U.S.? Whether slaves were considered \\\"not human\\\" I don't know, but it seems that a case could be made that they weren't treated as \\\"people\\\" as defined in the Bill of Rights. And since the nation is nominally based on the Declaration of Independence which states that \\\"all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness\\\", it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definition of humanity. \",\"Well,I tried not to get involved in this never ending talk,but,man,I REALLY got hot about this bullshit.

And in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is  indicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a   perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might  make that he is unable to even leave the house.    In science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible  and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these  discoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata  --- the search for scope and the search for certainty.    If 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and  Leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither  of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since  they lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of  a rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus.  It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid  grounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton  and Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great  deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost  through the mistakes they made.     These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and sci.psychology.  According to these posters  \\\"If it's not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science.\\\"  Taken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies  are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification  of science.    For one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology  results in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside  the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have  no chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this  is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless,  it is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has  certainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish  arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment  --- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come  with anything worthwhile.    Furthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is one of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate questions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance.  For instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative. (One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's assertion that current scientific methods \\\"avoid all known errors.\\\")  I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental  error in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the  others.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all  too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are  worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\" That sounds like an old _Dragnet_ episode.    \\\"Joe and I went to the apartment of Prime Suspect.

If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.\\\"  Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?  If we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us?  Why would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I will die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have before that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be content to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too are dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.  In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically mean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and fend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no matter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.  If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be it.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants my respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it does, then they will be very strong and true.   Jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was Osiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or Norse legend, if memory serves.  But still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?   If your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do -- provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any religion.   That's precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin. Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?   You've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he just rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.  But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the verses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view, which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only he or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with that: substitute \\\"Moslem\\\" or \\\"Buddhist\\\" or \\\"Satanist\\\" instead of \\\"Christian\\\", and it means the same thing.  Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD, you've got some convincing to do.   And in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities where there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life.  As long as you keep your beliefs to yourself, I'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start waving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.\",\"Many of you at this point have seen a copy of the  Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act by now.

The point of formal training  must be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion to know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike  in a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular. Countersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among  new bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the  motorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the direction opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous. I have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she is to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the  motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right  handle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road.  A worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn the rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.  The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency  situations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) of countersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.\",\"HI All, Can someone point me towards some articles on 'boids' or flocking algorithms... ?

I have my eye on two choices.  Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.  Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales (according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169 mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.  I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400 dpi) and price ($149).    Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of prices.  Which should I buy?  If you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would recommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range (under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.\",\"A Unix tool of cryptographic significance is available for anonymous ftp.  \\\"agrep 2.0.4\\\" -- a fast approximate pattern-matching tool  source code project available from:  cs.arizona.edu   in directory \\\"agrep\\\"  agrep is a very fast fuzzy search tool with a tremendous number of powerful search options.  The one most obviously applicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to specify the \\\"similarity\\\" of matches in the data.  For example say you make up a password/phrase of \\\"qimwe7l\\\". Of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not in any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it to en entry that could be varied by some \\\"crack\\\" program to brute-force search for it?  You use agrep to find out.  Looking with argument for none, one or two errors, no matches.  Good so far.  But   agrep -3 \\\"qimwe7l\\\" bigwordandphraselist  finds that the pattern \\\"qimwe7l\\\" is too close to the pattern \\\"imsel\\\" (part of \\\"himself\\\" and a host of others), to be of any cryptographic value as a key.  An error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of letters like \\\"teh\\\" for \\\"the\\\".  A minimally acceptable password would have to pass as *least* level 3 in order not immediately ruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password. (In real cryptographic use, my personal passphrases clear at *least* level 8 on my rather large [>80 meg] word and phrase lists.)   And for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o' typos) the tool is unexcelled.  For example, For example, say I want to find out what people think about Gibson's SF book \\\"Neuromancer\\\" in the huge SF-Lover's archives. Even with an error distance specification as small as of \\\"1\\\" I will find all those people who think the title was \\\"Necromancer\\\" or other common typos.  Why miss anything?  Also, the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns IN PARALLEL at Boyer-Moore (sublinear) speeds.  Great for a NSA wannabe to look for your name, terrorists names, special Tagalog or religious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.  You can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000 random three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that don't score the X chi-square 'birthday' hits on message size Y.  You think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing the pattern on you?  No problem.  Try agrep -p NSA to find NSA, National Security Agency, NSecAg, No Such Agency, National Scrabble Association, N*S*A, etc.  You can also specify \\\"fixed\\\" areas: looking for license plate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct, you might say:  agrep -2 <XYZ>123 licenseplatedatabase  will find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors (addition, substitution, deletion) in the number area.  You can also \\\"weight\\\" the relative \\\"cost\\\" for substiutions, additions, or deletion errors.  For example, when searching DNA patterns for a particular protein combination, you might know that some kinds of damage cause the \\\"A\\\" nucelotide to drop out more than other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting -Dc where you set the \\\"deletion cost\\\" to count as \\\"c\\\" errors.  A steganographic use (I even used \\\"agrep -2 \\\"<steg>eograp\\\" E\\\" just now to find the correct spelling!) would be to intentionally introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe.  Lots of possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext...  Also with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easy to abstract the \\\"hits\\\" into a useful form.  For example,  agrep -d \\\"^From\\\" 'PGP;(passphrase|Zimmerman|NSA)'  says output the entire mail record, delimited by 'From' that contains 'PGP' and contains either 'passphrase', 'Zimmerman', or 'NSA'.  And agrep has been measured an order-of-magnitude faster than the second-best similarity tool publicly available.  As usual, I will be glad to e-mail the source and docs to those who reqest them by e-mail IF they cannot do an anonymous FTP.  Get this now. It is too powerful to stay in the hands of the NSA.

Opening statements were given by both the prosecution and the defense, each side presenting its version of what happenned last August.  The prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to Idaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the \\\"evil\\\" federal government.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal agents \\\"sawed off\\\" shotguns and later failed to appear for trial: Despite repeated \\\"good faith\\\" efforts to get Weaver to surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted when Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and began firing.  According to the prosecution, three people were taking an \\\"offensive action\\\" against an FBI helicopter when an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.  The defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern Idaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted simply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to sell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution alleged, want to become a \\\"regular supplier\\\").  The defense also argued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when he wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly, but I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist angle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  The failure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given an incorrect court date and then indicted before that date. The shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed Weaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaver then fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal agent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found, there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic: However, agents were near the body for an extended period of time and could have played with the select-fire - this will have to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims that Vicki Weaver was only going to \\\"look at the body\\\" [not recover?] of her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.  Prosecution quote: \\\"Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made that confrontation.\\\" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist  Defense quote: \\\"The evidence in this case is going to show that this is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged with crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that the government did commit.\\\"  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]  Notes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters heeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protests outside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate again had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including \\\"Tim\\\" again.  \\\"Tim\\\" claimed he was a skinhead, who were \\\"ordinary, working class people.\\\"  He also claimed he was for \\\"white pride, not white power.\\\"  Outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview with Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly what the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.  In an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about a dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the courthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence in action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some tidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent were volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they believed in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement, repeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the defendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the recounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the \\\"sawed off\\\" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another good one!).  Today (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to begin presenting evidence.

It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams.  Just as Marxism \\\"fails\\\" to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and the state is to \\\"wither away,\\\" libertarians frequently fail to show how weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human condition.

The argument is not between those who want \\\"limited\\\" government and those who want \\\"unlimited\\\" government.

They had contact with a lawyer, so I am inclined to believe they had an idea of what their situation actually was.  This also leads to the conspiracy theory that the lawyer had the BATF pinned on rights violations if the BD's acted as witnesses, hence the arson.  I doubt that one too, but it is still quite clear that leaving a safe place to surrender is a rather stupid thing to do until that place is no longer safe.    As a matter of course, given how they've allowed no other views to be heard.  I'll reserve judgement until the trial, but so far as the FBI is concerned their statements carry the same amount of weight as photons at rest.    Ludicrous, yes.  Possible, yes.  Plausible?  Get the jury.    That's what gets me too.  It is likely the cult members were holed up in an enforced place inside the building.

In addition, the introduction of CS gas for several hours would have rendered many of them immobile if not unconscious when their masks quit.

On Friday the 16th of April I took possesion of a 12' Cobra Links lock, 1\\\" diameter. This was a special order.  I weighs a lot. I had to carry it home and it was digging into my shoulder after about two blocks.  I have currently a Kryptonite Rock Lock through the front wheel, a HD padlock for the steering lock, a Master padlock to lock the cover to two front spokes, and the Cobra Links through the rear swing arm and around a post in an underground parking garage.  Next Friday the 30th I have an appointment to have an alarm installed on me bike.  When I travel the Cobra Links and the cover and padlock stay at home.  By the way. I also removed the plastic mesh that is on the Cobra Links and encased the lock from end to end using bicycle inner tubes (two of them) I got the from bicycle dealer that sold me the Cobra Links. The guys were really great and didn't mark up the price of the lock much and the inner tubes were free.  Later. \",\" Which, considering the amount Bush&congress added to it, would be a not-inconsiderable achievement.  While we're on the subject, I also believe that the supply-side claim that reducing taxes raised revenue is also false, because they typically factor in SocSec taxes, which were *raised* a considerable amount, at the same time that income taxes were cut.  If you look at income tax revenue alone, it fell after after the cuts began, and didn't recover for several years. By then, record deficits were well entrenched.  *crunch, crunch*\",\"Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday      Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. \\\"What could be better,\\\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging?      \\\"It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,\\\" announced Ryne Sandberg.  \\\"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to win.      \\\"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\\\"      The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.      Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center.  \\\"Cool Papa\\\" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat.        \\\"Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\\\"  So came the analysis from Frank Chance.      The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.      Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.      Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st      Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday. The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season.      Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday. The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2.  \\\"We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed,\\\" remarked Lou Brock.  \\\"I don't see why we can't win this division.\\\"      The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. -------------------------------------------------------------------      New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th!     \\\"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitcher's park like this,\\\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith Hernandez added that \\\"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\\\"  The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.      Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------      San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):      Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw, \\\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\\\"      Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the National League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace. They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.      In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. -------------------------------------------------------------------      San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the trade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.      Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after 10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home, and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):      Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \\\"Normally,\\\" Drysdale remarked, \\\"I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't Davis will get decked once.\\\"      The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet.  \\\"It's as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit home runs',\\\" remarked Roy Campanella.      The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the Astros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent. Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.      \\\"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\\\" he explained.      \\\"How can we do that,\\\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.      \\\"They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time.\\\"      The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.      \\\"We're mostly a power team,\\\" remarked Ron Cey.  \\\"Jackie and, when he plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I guess that's why they're so successful there.\\\"  Indeed, it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.
